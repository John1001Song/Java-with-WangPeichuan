The other beside lamp didn't have a bulb in it at all.  I discovered that while putting my hand upside to see if the bulb was loose.  Thank God the lamp  happened to be in the \"off\" position, because one of my fingers went inside the socket!  The overhead light had two sockets, but only one bulb inside.  Again, very small and dim.  There was one other lamp on a very tiny table pushed into the corner of the tiny room.  The lamp did not have a bulb inside.  The bathroom sink has it's hot water is turned off somewhere upstream of the fixture.  When I turned on the hot water facet, absolutely no water of ANY temperature came out.  I checked the valve under the sink and it was open.  So it's off somewhere else upstream.  The top of the pop-up drain plug was broken off/missing.  So it was impossible to fill up the sink.  I guess even if it wasn't broken, it would have been difficult to fill up the sink, anyway, because the attachment point for the pop-up was missing.  The sink is a pedestal sink, so there is no counter.  There is no toilet paper holder.  The toilet paper sits in a basket on top of the toilet.  No biggie, except that I had to keep removing the top of the toilet to figure out why it wouldn't flush.  The shower is 28\" x 30\".  Compare that to an old fashioned shower that is 36\" x 36\".

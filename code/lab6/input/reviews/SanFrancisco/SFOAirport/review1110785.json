Many positives, few improvements","reviewText":"Spent three nights at the hotel and overall our stay at Bay Landing Hotel was pleasing.   Many positives such as free parking, clean rooms, quiet--albeit it was near the airport, our room #327 had a wonderful view of the bay and we could watch the jets take off and land, excellent paved walking/jogging path that goes up and down the bay.  \r\n\r\nFree breakfast, but some breakfast items one needed to heated or reheated with the microwave as they were preprocessed frozen items ie bacon, sausage patty, omelets, ham, & a hash-brown potato wedge.   They did have three waffle irons for fresh made waffles.  Plenty of sliced and diced fruit and hot oatmeal.  Four different juice options and hot coffee. Their breakfast is nowhere as good as one's done by Embassy Suites, but it wasn't horrible either.   I just stayed away from the items one needed to zap in the microwave.    The breakfast dinning area is also small and congested.  Overall their breakfast was OK, but that is a good thing as I didn't overeat.    \r\n\r\nOur room was extremely clean and spacious.  Beds were a bit small but comfortable.  They could have placed another bed or sofa couch in there to occupy the open \"dead\" space as the room had too much un-utilized space.  I recommend that they replace the their double sized beds with queens or king sized ones.  To be fair, they may have had rooms with double queens, but this room was the only one available for us when we booked.  \r\n\r\nBottom line---We would stay here again.

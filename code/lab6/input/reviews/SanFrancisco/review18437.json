The bathtub and sink were clogged and did not drain well. The room smelled like urine and poo but the bed sheets and towels were clean. The windows are very thin and you can hear EVERYTHING  going on outside on the streets so we were not able to get good, restful sleep. The hotel lobby was under construction. Overall, the hotel was safe and in a good location near great restaurants and shopping.

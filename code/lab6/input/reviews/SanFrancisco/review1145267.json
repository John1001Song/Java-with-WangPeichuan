If you are loud and like privacy, you might not love it, though, because you can kind of hear stuff in other spaces (just like in a normal old house). The gardens are beautiful and spacious with lots of separate lounging areas. There's a nice hot tub in a covered gazebo outside. There's a spiral staircase on the third floor that goes to a rooftop access with tables, chairs, and 360 view of city. They only charge $2 for sodas and bottled water (honor system!), and offer coffee/tea all day and free sherry and port for customers in the lobby.

We stayed in the annex adjacent to the main house & were upgraded to a larger room We would have been satisfied with a smaller room since we chose the B & B for its proximity to Bernal Heights & uniqueness of a B & B stay in SF versus our usual Hotel visits. We liked the variety offered at breakfast time & the option to enjoy breakfast in our rooms. Great roof top views & convenient public transportation options nearby.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Portland, Oregon","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-02-27T03:49:17Z","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}],"userDisplayName":"Alma","roomTypeId":"","isUnverified":false,"isFlaggable":false,"isRecommended":"YES"},{"hotelId":"1145267","totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"photos":[],"reviewId":"20525148","itinId":"256746795","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Amy","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Unique and fun place to stay","reviewText":"Awesome rooftop views, comfortable, unique place to stay.

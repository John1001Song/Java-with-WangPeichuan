This Holiday Inn is one of the best I've stayed at, with newer facilities, a restaurant, bar, and convenient (albeit pricey) parking. $37 a night to park but that's expected in the big city.\r\n\r\nThe room was nice with a cool view of San Fran, right in the heart of the Civic Center area. This is pretty centrally located to anywhere you want to go, which was great for my girlfriend and I. The room came with a Keurig coffee (we had a King Bed room) and was very clean. Seemed like it had been renovated recently. Staff was very friendly, check-in was kind of a wait but what can you do? Plus, their vending machines for pop only cost $1.50. When is the last time that happened?\r\n\r\nThe walls are a bit thin, so if you're offended by late-night/early-morning love-making, maybe get some earplugs or check elsewhere.

They only have 1 restaurant in the hotel and frankly it's terrible and overpriced and horrid hours so make sure you bring your own food. They charge for everything and anything including like almost 20 a day for parking and it'snot really that secure and very small spaces. If you have a truck than I wish you the best of luck getting in and out. The positive about this was its close to where I was supposed to be during my trip made my life easier. The sleeping conditions well bed was horrid and the sheets and stuff they put on there even worse. I ended up going out and buying my own to feel comfortable and eventually slept on the floor one night due to how rock hard the bed felt.

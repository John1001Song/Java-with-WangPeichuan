Another reviewer pointed out the channel selection on the TV leaves a bit to be desired. Much is made of their \"amenities\", for which they shamelessly propose to charge an additional $20/day - for internet (which appears in several places on the Expedia webpage as \"free\", so read the fine print), bicycles (in hilly SF? um, ok...), telephone calls (people use their cell phones) and a few other \"standards\" in other hotels like a fitness room. The wine hour was a nice touch, but fairly common in SF: it is whisked away promptly at 6 pm, 6:01 is too late, so sorry. The morning coffee was tepid.

I usually don't leave reviews but this hotel stay was the worst.  This is a highly priced hotel, obviously your expectations are a little high.  Pillows are so terrible.  Even two pillow will make you feel like you are laying on the floor.  The bed it self is so old.  When you turn you can actually hear the springs.  This is just the start.  We finally managed to sleep around 1:00 AM.  At 2:30 AM Fire Alarm went off.  The whole seventh floor was suppose to be evacuated but not a single staff member were to be found on seventh floor.  When all of us managed to make it downstairs to Main lobby, No one knew what was going on except one person at front desk.  We waited in the lobby for almost an hour just to find out that it was false alarm.  If this is a high class hotel, then what is security doing?  Some one pulled the fire alarm and ran with out the security catching them?  After all of that drama, right at 9:00 AM, room cleaning staff kept knocking on my door.  Even though the check out time is not until 12 noon.  She knocked for good 3 minutes until I finally woke and managed to open the door and tell her that we are not checking out until 12 noon.  Did not sleep that night.  When checking out and told the person that I had a terrible experience at this hotel,  He said \"I am sorry, we will just refund your emanity fees\"  Which is 3% compare to what I  paid for the hotel.

This is already the second time we live in. Everything is good. But only one thing is hotel amenity fee. I don't know why it charges us. We don't use anything within the hotel. I google search it and some said the wireless service is also part of it. So anyway, except this hotel amenity fee, others are all good. Good location, clean room and nice staff.

","reviewText":"Starting with the location...I was in a panic when I driver pulled up to the hotel. It was dark and there were homeless people everywhere. The hotel security came out to the car to escort us inside. The hotel itself is an older building that has been restored. Overall, a very cute place. The rooms are small with very limited storage. I had to leave the suit cases out all week because there is zero room in the closet. Drawer storage was equivalent to two night stand drawers. The bathroom itself was tiny and needs to be redone. Overall it was mainly just worn. \r\n\r\nWhile the hotel in conveniently located just two blocks from Union Sqare, it's a rough two blocks. We made sure that we were back inside before dark each night. Even during the day the walk is dirty and smells strongly of urine. In addition you will encounter many homeless individuals asking for money about every 20 feet. \r\n\r\nThe hotel staff was friendly. We never asked for much to really rate their quality. The $30 amenity fee was a joke. Really you are paying $30 for wireless access and flavored water in the lobby. There is a restaurant and bar attached to the hotel, but it was open limited hours. The drinks that we had from there were fine, but we didn't feel that the menu had many options. The Walgreens across the street was the closest thing that we had to room service. \r\n\r\nI would not recommend this hotel for people with children, or anyone not completely accustom to city life.

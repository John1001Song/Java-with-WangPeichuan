I did wish, however, that the shuttle went to other places than just the airport. we used Uber for our transportation, and the prices were reasonable. they did put us in a handicap accessible room, and water got all over the floor during a shower. that is why I rated it a 4. also, after a day, the bathroom started to smell like a sewer, and the maintenance man said he couldn't fix it because how the floor of the shower was. that was disappointing. that's why I rated that a 4.

We wouldn't hesitate to recommend the hotel to anyone.\r\n\r\nNot only is the hotel of a good standard, its location is ideal - access to downtown is easy, a very nice area next to the hotel to chill out overlooking the Bay and, whilst on Fisherman's Wharf, the Argonaut is at the \"quiet\" end away from the frenetic Pier 39.\r\n\r\nSome great independent cafes and a good Starbucks behind the hotel for breakfast; plenty of fair, if not great, restaurants along the wharf. The hotel's own restaurant is good but suffers from a limited menu.\r\n\r\nThe only downside was that on a couple of occasions we noticed noise from the next room, when children were having a tantrum. But this was intermittent and generally not a problem.\r\n","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"The housekeeping and staff on the front door & lobby were all very courteous and helpful.

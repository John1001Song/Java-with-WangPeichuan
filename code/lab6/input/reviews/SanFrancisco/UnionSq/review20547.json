Our flight arrived at 10 a.m. And they were able to provide us a room right away so we didn't have to wait until the 3 pm check in time. Overall our stay was fine apart from a couple of minor snafus. The most irritating one being that we ordered pizza to stay in one evening and went down to the bar to get drinks to take up. The bartender took our order, gave me my bud light but didn't get my husband his cocktail for 10 minutes. Instead she thought it was more important to take a few dirty cups to the kitchen. We clearly were just wanting to get drinks and go back up but she was rude and told us to sit down and served several others ahead of us. The situation could have been handled much more professional and productive on her end. Not a huge deal but annoying none the less. \r\nThis hotel is located a half block from major shopping like saks fifth avenue, coach, and more high end stores. I loved hearing the man playing the trumpet through the open window at night.

Also, ice arrives in an open container so that it melts right away. The mini bar is very packed (could be a good thing if you want to buy a lot from there) but leaves no room for any personal use (as diabetics we needed a place to keep insulin which required about 4 cubic inches of space and that meant putting the insulin in odd positions on top of drinks---yes, it was THAT crowded...); forget about using it for your own drinks or food.

The hotel lobby does retain a lot of its old world charm and represents today's boutique hotel environment. However, that's where all the good stuff ends. When we first walked into our room, we were greeted by a strange smoky and old musty odor. It inhabited the small hallway between the front door and main living space. We immediately called the front desk and told them. As there were no other rooms available at the time, they offered to clean the carpet as we decided to go out for a stroll around Union Square. When we returned, the smell was replaced by something more pleasant but the odor returned after a few hours. We decided to just avoid that space since we only needed to pass it when entering or exiting the room. A lot of the room fixtures are in disrepair and the bathroom was oddly shaky as well. Cleanliness was not a strongpoint as dirt was visibly accumulated on the door hinges and when I went to rest for the evening and looked at the ceiling, there was a huge clump of dust around one of the ceiling fixture covers. I just prayed that it would not fall on my while I slept.

I initially thought I had booked the Holiday Inn Express in Burlingame and that had better reviews. I was pleasantly surprised upon check-in. Our room was very spacious, the bed was comfy and the seating area was great! Each room has a larger than average hotel fridge and a microwave. The room does have blackout shades despite some of the reviews on here. I'm not sure how people missed them! \r\nBreakfast has many options and it's free! Parking wasn't an issue at all. They do charge $10, but we knew that going in as it is stated on the website. Considering it's near the airport you have to expect this. Larger hotels charge even more to park. The only complaint I had was the air freshener used in the room. It needs to be toned down quite a bit as our clothes even smelled of the scent.

We can make it to the car rental center in minutes down the road, get our own breakfast downstairs in the lobby for a quick bite, get on the freeway two blocks away, shop at Costco next door for flowers, gifts, supplies etc. and not pay through the nose for a room in the City where you're most likely going to have your car broken into than here at the HIE.  \r\n\r\nThe hotel front lobby staff have been here for several years and recognizable by their pleasant, efficient and friendly welcome each and every visit.

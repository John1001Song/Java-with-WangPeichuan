I enjoyed the location next to Union Square and close to Market Street. Tons of shops and hole in the wall restaurants San Fran is known for. The room itself seemed clean. However, they put us in a handicap room right next to the construction. I understand hotels need updating and I didn't have a problem with the notes they left in ever room describing the construction will be done between 8am-5pm. But they didn't start at 8am they started much earlier. We called the front desk to complain about the workers being so loud earlier than described but they did nothing. They didn't even apologize. None of the staff asked us how things were going and I don't think I ever saw any of them smile once. It was not a pleasant experience. The staff was terrible and not friendly or helpful.

When we arrived the entire hotel was under renovation. The gym and computer rooms were closed for renovation. This is fine, but when we booked not once were we notified of the condition of the hotel. This was a very disappointing experience. It taught me a lesson and questions to always ask prior to booking a hotel e.g. Is your hotel under any type of remodel? Are the amenities mentioned on your website all available? The valet person working all week would get into arguments with the front desk people every single time I saw him. This made me uncomfortable with him handling a rental car I was responsible for. The front desk staff were all great. There is even a amazing Mexican place and Starbucks directly connected to this hotel. I think once all their construction is complete it could be kinda cool, but unfortunately we had a terrible experience due to the construction. The bathroom in our room was tiny. There was literally no counter and we had to leave or stuff in the sink. Last, do something about the valet driver. He even double parked my rental in the bus/taxi lane right in the CENTER of the lane. What a bad experience.

The TV didn't work! Had to have the maintenance man come fix it. Mind you I am trying to get ready and this interrupts my routine makes us late. He was quite nice though. The room over all was nicer than I expected. We literally just slept there so we weren't looking to pay an arm and a leg so I was worried about how clean it was going to be.

It was my job to arrange for the hotel and car. I have used Expedia on several occasions to book or reserve the things needed for my trips. I'm satisfied with Expedia but not with this Hotel at all. Although we were greeted in  a professional manner we soon learned of the problems with our rooms. The trim paneling for the door was missing on one side, a light bulb was burnt out and the room was dusty as soon by a large amount of dust which had accumulated around the vents. My friend who is elderly and disabled found very quickly that the main door lock to his room was malfunctioning. Upon calling the front desk they came up and had to toggle both the inner and outer handles to get the door to close. They didn't fix the problem only blamed it on a malfunction and showed my friend how to proceed from there on out. At 3:33 am the fire alarm went off due to a broken hot water line. We got no sleep so it didn't make for a very good day! Lastly we had a cookie ice cream which was taken by the front desk and put into there refrigerator for us to pick up but when we returned the next day it was gone!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":1,"ratingHotelCondition":1,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":1,"positiveRemarks":"Without getting any sleep it is extremely hard to say what we did like but I will say the staff tried to speak to us in a professional manner.","negativeRemarks":"The cleanliness of the rooms as well as making sure that everything is working correctly before renting them out to guests.","locationRemarks":"The location was close to the airport but we found that for our needs we needed to travel at least 20-30 minutes away to get to anything of interest.","lastInitial":"L","userLocation":"Laguna Niguel, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-06-23T19:11:11Z","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}],"userDisplayName":"","roomTypeId":201547327,"isUnverified":false,"isFlaggable":false,"isRecommended":"NO"},{"hotelId":"522505","totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"photos":[],"reviewId":"576b8456d289480b7c0fe093","itinId":"1136491049730","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[{"userNickname":"Indy","displayLocale":"en_us","isFlaggable":true,"date":"2016-06-26T01:12:08Z","response":"Dear Valued Guest,\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your kind words and for choosing Hotel Focus SFO during your trip to San Francisco.

Comfy bed, Spacious Room","reviewText":"The time we went to San Fran all the hotels were almost sold out since there was a convention so this was our last option. It was definitely overpriced about 2 times what it normally is. However, the staff was super accommodating since we arrived about 5am and couldn't check in till around 3p, they let us store our bags so we could go out and explore the city. It was really convenient that the hotel included a breakfast buffet since there are no other restaurants around. I thought the buffet had a lot of variety. As for the hotel room it was spacious with two king beds and the beds were really comfy. The air con though was a bit confusing to use since it tends to go to heater when you put it to 70 degrees and has to be 69 or less to be cold. I did like this hotel but I wouldn't choose it again since it isn't close to the city and there isn't much around the area for food options.

The view we got was a white building across the street... I did not know that is considered a view nowadays. The room i stayed in was room 562 which was extremely small and the beds were barely full size.  I guess for SF that is considered rather large. The room states that it sleeps up to four people but only provides the room with 2 large white towels in the shower. The next morning when the cleaning crew came they knocked once and did not wait for people in the room to respond before entering. Perhaps that was our fault that we did not put the DO NOT DISTURB at 7AM sign on the door first. But seriously, as a courtesy, please at least wait a few seconds for people to answer before entering. Also, there was construction going on at the hotel so noises starts at 6AM. on the plus side, there is a Starbucks coffee on the first floor but don't expect free coffee for guests.

As a brand new hotel in the heart of San Francisco, safety is one of our greatest concerns. Our back entrance is lock protected with a room key card reader so only guests and employees have access. We do agree that our location is perfect for a quick step to multiple public transportation options SF has to offer. We are curious if you had an opportunity to explore the hotel, as we do offer several lounge areas including the Cloud, Hallidie Library, and a separate seating area for our guests at The Turn Cafe restaurant. We have received many compliments on the breakfast offerings at Turn Cafe and hope you have the opportunity to try a dish on your next visit.

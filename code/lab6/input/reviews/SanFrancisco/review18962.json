It was not too clean, the floor hadn't been swept, the sheets and one scrawny blanket were too small for the bed. The air conditioning only worked fitfully. The staff stood outside our room and talked and smoked, so we couldn't open the window. We could hear everything in the room above us. When we returned to the hotel after a day of sightseeing, the bed was made, but the bedspread was jammed on top of the TV cabinet, the staff did not clean out the coffee pot, nor replenish the coffee, cups and stirrer packets. We only got two chintzy towels. The worst thing was that you had to run the water for at least 5 minutes before it got hot. What a waste, especially during a drought! The tub floor was sticky and had hair stuck to it. The \" continental breakfast\" was packaged pastries and toast. The TV reception was spotty.

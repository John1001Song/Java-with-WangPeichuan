We were there to welcome in my son's twins at Mission hospital. Janmesh inquired each time we came in about the new family. On one day as we were leaving the parking lot Janmesh ran outside to give us a box of See's chocolate to give to our Daughter in law. I have traveled extensively in several countries and I can honestly say that I have never been given this type of positive personal attention. Without Janmesh this would have been an average hotel stay without becoming such a special memory for my whole family. Thank You Janmesh for adding to the the happiness of welcoming twins into our family.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"10 minute drive to the Mission Hospital.

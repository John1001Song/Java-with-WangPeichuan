And anytime someone else's door was opened it sounded like someone was coming in our room so I was woken up a few times thinking someone was trying to get in our room. The room was decently clean. Breakfast was a bit of a nightmare- very small room for the number of guests and no order to the lines or way things are set up so you were constantly in the way of someone and being pushed around. Even though it was quite chilly that morning we braved the outdoor area just to get out of the dining room.

Found one elevator out of service due to renovation, but I was content waiting for the second elevator as I enjoyed some complimentary coffee. Two bedroom suite was spacious and clean.

We read some reviews of other hotels in the area that talked of small rooms and poor service at only $400 and up a night. Then we found Super 8. Yes, the room was small. But it was clean, an older hotel, but clean. It had it's own bathroom. It included a basic breakfast. Not a fancy breakfast but very probably what most people would have on a daily basis at home.

The establishment is a motor lodge rather than a hotel.  Rooms are accessed from outside rather than from inside the building.  The room was very dark because of the very small window with no drapes.  The fixture overhead was very dim.  My room was n the fifth floor.  The elevator only went to the 4 th floor.  I had to drag my luggage up a narrow flight of stairs around the back of the building to the fifth floor.  There was no alarm clock and had very thin walls with no sound proofing.  I could hear the couple next door engaging in coitus.  There were black hairs n the shower.  I humored the next morning when an employee was carefully monitoring the guests for the very cheap breakfast of only carb and no protein options.  I have never been so misled by a hotel description n Expedia.  Expedia was not successful in getting the motor lodge to refund the two nights I did not use.

Available parking as soon as we pulled up which in SF is not easy to find... Walk in the lobby doors and immediately was greeted by the most WONDERFUL employee I've EVER encountered at any business (I'm not exaggerating by saying this). Stacy made my friend and I feel like we were coming home to visit mom who hadn't seen us in a year. She explained everything to us so throughly and we felt like we could ask her 100 questions without her being bothered by us. Her energy was so refreshing and it was great to have our first interaction with someone a postive one after being on the road for 5 hours. I could seriously write a book about how much I adored this woman. Just know, this hotel is clean, smells good, no bugs, no dirty sheets, comfy beds, big shower, beautiful view of the Golden Gate Bridge, very nice pool area, great working a/c in the room, and QUIET at night! the free breakfast was basically all breads (muffins, bagels, literally sliced bread, croissants, waffle mix to make your own waffle, cinnamon buns without the sauce) a bucket of apples and not ripe bananas, small cereal bar with regular milk, orange and apple juice, and coffee. not a great selection but it's free so whatever.

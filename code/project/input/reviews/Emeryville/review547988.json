There's a lobby community space with couches and a flat screen, a dining hall that functions as an impromptu drinking spot at night, vending machines that sell instant food, cords, and other sundries (condoms?...nah, too family oriented), a couple hang-out rooms disguised as meeting rooms when you have to video conference, but don't want to from your room, and a breakfast buffet where cereal is the highlight. Then there's the typical business hotel spaces: a room with a PC and printer, a fitness center with a couple machines, and a pool. Everything here is DIY: guests taxi their own bags with luggage carts, do thier own laundry in the coin-operated machines or the bathtub, and make their own meals using the in-room kitchen stocked with pots, dishes, tableware, dish soap, etc. This place is compatible for the independent type who doesn't want a hotel to dictate how they stay, or how much they spend on overpriced hotel meals, but don't expect high-end or luxury for the high prices.  Not quite a hotel, a house, or a hostel, but trying to be everything simultaneously.

We had tickets to a Giants game and chose this hotel based on proximity to a Caltrain station. We arrived at 3pm to check in and were told to come back in 45 minutes because our room was not ready. We had to catch the train at 4:19 in order to make it to the game so we had to change and get ready in the lobby restrooms. Since our room was still not ready by 4pm we had to store our luggage back in our car. After the game at around 11pm we were able to get our room. The moment we walked in our sense of smell was assaulted. my 8 year old asked if the scented the room with smelly armpits. I would say it was more of a cross between wet birthplace and damp moldy carpet. That wasn't even the best part. The carpet was actually damp throughout the room!  When we finally settled down to sleep in the mattresses from a 1978 RV, we couldn't sleep because there was a party with bumping music directly below us. When I called the front desk, they said \"sorry about that, we could try asking if they can settle down a bit\"   I will never stay there again.

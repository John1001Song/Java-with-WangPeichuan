The only problem with this hotel is its proximity to the airport and Bart line.

Seemed like we were right at the end of the runway or maybe they change the flight path at night to avoid other more densely populated areas. I don't know, but it seemed that as soon as the Bart line (which literally runs alongside the hotel) ends its run for the day, the planes start theirs.

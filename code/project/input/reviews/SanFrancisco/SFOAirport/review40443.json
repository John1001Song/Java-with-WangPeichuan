Smelled stale and strange odor in the room. You cannot control the air from the room, apparently it's all central air and all you can do is turn on the fan. If you like to leave a bathroom light on for night trips to the bathroom, forget it...all the lights are on timers that auto turn off except the two next to the bed. The bed was comfortable. The night staff was very friendly, Day staff not so much. The rooms are outside entrance. The hotel has three Stories and no elevator, so you have to lug your luggage up and down outdoor stairs if you're  on upper floors. Parking is limited, if the hotel is full you may not find a place to park in their parking lot. I overheard people complaining about that when I was searching for ice. Thin walls, noisy, woke up early to the intense smell of bacon, which I guess would be okay if I wasn't a vegatarian. I will not stay here again. It's a overpriced no frills outdated hotel that charges you for the proximity to the airport. If I hadn't been exhausted from my flight I wouldn't have stayed there.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":2,"ratingHotelCondition":1,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"Bed was acceptable.

Don't expect to be wow. This is a place to go to for a clean room for a night or two near SFO airport. The free breakfast is a huge plus for those that don't want to hassle with looking for food if they have an early morning flight.\r\n\r\nThe room had clean sheets, floors and bathroom. My biggest complaint was the noisy overhead vent in the bathroom that you CAN NOT turn off. I also had to pull the plug from the in-room refrigerator as it was nearing it's end of life and was making very loud sounds each time the condenser turned on. It was absolutely impossible to sleep with the refrigerator on. The vent was manageable with the bathroom door closed. Lastly, you can hear the planes taking off and landing as the hotel is directly across the lake from SFO air strips.

There was no fan working in the bathroom, so that didn't help. On top of that the place was generally old and grubby.\r\nIn the breakfast bar there were only 2 - 20\" tables! That's for approx. 200 guests! I know SF is expensive, but this room with taxes cost almost $200 and was truly almost the worst place we've ever stayed.

There's personal fridge, widescreen hdtv, electric iron, microwave, complete set of toiletries ( mini shampoo/conditioners, bath soap, shower cap included), and complete set of fresh and clean towels. The room and bathroom were clean and presentable.  I only have three minor gripes:  1. I could hear the tv in the next room. Although not at a disturbing intensity, it can be an issue to others. The sound from my tv kind of covered over the next room's tv sound. 2. The bath tub was slow in draining, so it was partially clogged down the line somewhere. Management should make sure their cleaners need to test drainage each time. I had to stand on the top of the tub walls on the later part of my shower because I didn't want my feet to get soaked on the gray water. 3. Lacks a small table.\r\n\r\nOverall, I had a positive experience, and had a good night's sleep, on comfortable bed and pillows, and clean sheets. Most of all, for the price I got of about $110 per night, it's the place that gave me the best value for what I was looking for - just a few minutes to the Golden Gate.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Southern California","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-07-30T00:22:16Z","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}],"userDisplayName":"","roomTypeId":200383585,"isUnverified":false,"isFlaggable":false,"isRecommended":"YES"},{"hotelId":"1146383","totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"photos":[],"reviewId":"57929bab92b3430b2979b1e7","itinId":"1140323943015","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"It was a nice room and clean","reviewText":"I love the staff very nice and helpful the room was clean and cozy.

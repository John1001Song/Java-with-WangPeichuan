Only thing about the bathroom is it took me a while to figure out how to change the water flow from the bath tap to the shower tap. The room was spacious and the bed was super comfy. The only major downfalls where the slow elevator and the noise from other guests, I was in a corner room and when the people next door shut their door or even hopped into bed it sounded like it was in my own room and I even got scared at one point that someone was trying to open my door but it was just the people next door.

The location is beyond great, just a 4 block walk to the trolley cars and plenty of buses to get you where you want to go. Parking is 49.00 per day at the hotel, we parked one block east of the hotel on Sutter and only paid $50.00 for two nights. The staff is the main reason we would go back. I asked the gentleman at the desk I think his name was Edward what sites we should see while in town. He provided us a detailed map of the area and pointed out what sites we could see on foot and what places we needed transportation. VERY HELPFUL, this guy should get a raise. My wife and I talked about him last night. Most employees don't go out of their way to help the way he did. This is a major reason we would go back, customer service, this place has it. No pool or Jacuzzi but that's ok. Plenty of places to eat in the area and my wife and I felt safe walking at night in he area. Great job Vertigo!!!!!!!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"Location, Staff, rooms and the history if the hotel.","negativeRemarks":"No room for it but we love a Jacuzzi.

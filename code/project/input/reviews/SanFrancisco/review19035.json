This king bed was the most comfortable bed my husband and I have ever slept on, we didn't want to wake up in the morning, so we didn't get up until 10:30 everyday.\r\nThere are many restaurants within a block or two. We found a Spanish restaurant serving tapa's that was delicious and rated high on Zagat and a Thai restaurant we liked.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"Easy to get to and a very comfortable bed.","negativeRemarks":"Newer towels and better fitting sheets.

The building, hotel room and dÃ©cor are dated, but I found the room neat, orderly, and clean.  The bed was great--perfect combination of softness and firmness.  And the sheets were over-the-top soft.  My two nights of sleep were exceptionally pleasant there.  \r\n\r\nThe two disappointments were the staff and bathroom linen.  \r\nSTAFF:The gentleman that checked me in was nice enough.  It was a late night check in and he processed me very quickly and I was off to my room.  However, the woman at the front desk the next morning appeared to be uninterested in anything going on with the guests.  She appeared to be surfing the web--her eyes were glued to the computer screen, short of when you said something to distract her.  Although she was not mean or curt, she just seemed distracted.  \r\n\r\nLINEN:  I'm not picky on the type of linen I get.  I understand how it goes--linen is costly and hotels can only afford so much.  However, my whole stock of wash clothes were like old rags you save to was your care.  All was worn out--just seemed old.  The part that really disappointed was that one of the rags looked so stained, that it really should have been thrown away.  The rest weren't that much better.  My advice to HoJo--invest in new linen.\r\n\r\nOtherwise everything was OK.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"Location!

Rooms were pleasant, but the bathroom was pretty small.  The lobby was a bit dark - but overall the hotel had charm and was a reasonable price for SF.  There are more indigents than expected close in the area.  It was very centrally located for shopping and getting on tour buses.  I would stay here again.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"Location was excellent.","negativeRemarks":"Update the lobby area.","locationRemarks":"Close to Union Square.

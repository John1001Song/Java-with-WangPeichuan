","reviewText":"My GF and I were a little leery of the shared bathroom concept, but it was the only place we could afford within walking distance (about 7 minutes) to the pier so we decided to give it a go.  We would absolutely stay there again. The things we didn't love were worth the location and price for us.  We had to lug our huge suitcases up 2 flights of stairs to get to our room, but assistance was offered to us to help.  The room was small, like so tiny we had to open our suitcase on the bed because there wasn't enough floor space, but this was acceptable because we were really only using the room to sleep in.  Our \"window\" opened to an indoor hallway right next to another guests \"window\" but at least it gave the impression of more air coming in.  The bathrooms, although shared, were clean and we never had to wait for the toilet or shower.  Softer towels would be nice, but that's really my biggest complaint.  If you're looking for luxury, this isn't your place, but if you want a clean bed to sleep in and a shower you don't mind sharing, the location couldn't be better!  We had Safeway & The Cable Car just around the corner too!  Super convenient!

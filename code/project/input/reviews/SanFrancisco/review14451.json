There was definitely enough space for what you need (small walk-in and lots of storage under the bed).  The bed was honestly one of the comfiest beds we have ever slept in!    Bathroom was tiny but again, all you need and very clean.  Our room was ready when we arrived in San Fran around 11am which was awesome and staff was great. Location wise, it is right by everything you need (transit, restaurants and shopping).  There are homeless people honestly anywhere you go in San Fran - one street is good then another is a tad shady.  We were not bothered by any of them right by the hotel.  A minor downside to the hotel is the elevator.  As the hotel has an older feel which I really liked, the elevator is quite tiny and very slow which can be a negative if you have a big group or lots of luggage or are older.

Check in was easy, even though Expedia screwed up my name again, and it was a slight challenge to find my reservation. This is always a bit scary when the sign out front says \"NO VACANCY\". In the end they found our reservation and we got the \"non-smoking\" room we had booked. My wife swears that someone had been smoking in it, but for me the air freshener they used masked it OK. The room was large, but out-dated, even with a smallish flat screen TV. The sliding glass door in back shared a common balcony/walk overlooking the pool. The lock on that door seemed very flimsy and was hard to use. We only opened once and then turned on the AC and locked it as best we could. The bad was OK, the bathroom was OK though the sink seemed kind of flimsy and well used. Over all it worked fine for us as an overnight rest place between days at the racetrack.

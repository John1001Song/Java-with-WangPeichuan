Our room was right down the hall from the in-hotel restaurant, so the noise was a bit annoying sometimes when we were in the room after dinner and until the restaurant closed (mainly during the weekend).  The location was great - we could walk 2 blocks over and be on Fillmore Street, which had lots of cute shops, restaurants, and a Walgreens.  Pretty close to everything else as well (we took short Uber rides to Golden Gate Park, Pier 39, Palace of Fine Arts, etc.).  Comfy but sort of noisy bed (the frame/support), and the top to the nightstand was wobbly.  There was a long hair stuck to the bathroom wall when we arrived though - weird.  Would stay again though!

The room had nice furnishings and the bed was comfortable and temperature controls were easy to operate and responsive.  They offered free wine in the early evening hours and there is a restaurant located on the corner of the hotel.  I did not look for nor find out if there were extra services available such as an exercise room or laundry services.  I needed to have my boarding pass printed out and the front desk gladly did that for me as well as arrange a shuttle ride back to the airport.  I loved all the Japanese restaurants and shops nearby in the Japan Center.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"Clean room, very friendly staff.","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Oregon","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-04-04T17:06:54Z","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"BusinessTravelers","categoryLabel":"BusinessTravelers"}],"userDisplayName":"","roomTypeId":200794239,"isUnverified":false,"isFlaggable":true,"isRecommended":"YES"},{"hotelId":"5901","totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"photos":[],"reviewId":"56fcbbc9c93f2d097d6f88cd","itinId":"1129170188838","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Jeanette","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Hip in the Middle of San Fran!","reviewText":"Great check-in protocols ~ warm and friendly and welcoming after a long commute.

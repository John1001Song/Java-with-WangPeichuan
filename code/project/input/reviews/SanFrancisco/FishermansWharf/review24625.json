But by the time you pay the outrageous summer price and then pay for any \"extra\" things like Wi-Fi, coffee, a fridge or microwave in your room, and $60 each night for parking, it really adds up. We could only get a king bed room, so my 17 y.o. had to sleep on the floor (another outrageous fee for a rollaway). Stay a little bit further out and get some comfort.  City busses are pretty easy to use. Fisherman's Wharf is overrun with tourists and tourist-money-grabbing shops and restaurants, and if I went to San Fran again I'd stay elsewhere.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Washington state","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-07-30T23:54:17Z","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Families","categoryLabel":"Families"}],"userDisplayName":"","roomTypeId":200521618,"isUnverified":false,"isFlaggable":true,"isRecommended":"NO"},{"hotelId":"24625","totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"photos":[],"reviewId":"579cdedadbc3c50b08beef92","itinId":"1141399469655","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"MMA","managementResponses":[{"userNickname":"General Manager","displayLocale":"en_us","isFlaggable":true,"date":"2016-08-08T21:13:40Z","response":"Thanks for the feedback.

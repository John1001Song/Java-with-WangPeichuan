Pros: nice location, walking distance to union square and basically everywhere else. Only a 15 minute drive to most places in the city like golden gate park, fishermans wharf, and various food locations, it was also at an affordable price. Cons: the rooms are small but definitely able to room 2 guests, my boyfriend and I didn't have trouble staying in the room. Valet is the main issue here, for a steep price for valet parking, you would expect them to be on their game but it took around 30-40 minutes to wait for our car to be brought up so definitely call at least half an hour ahead instead of the 15-20 minutes they recommend. Our room had a nice view of the city but at the price of being at the 16th floor, meaning a very long elevator ride and at check out it was horrible having to stop at every floor because others had to get on too.

Loved the decor. The one downside was that the room got very stuffy especially after someone took a shower. There was no exhaust vent in the bathroom, and the window was shut and sealed so we couldn't even open it just so slightly to circulate the air. It would have helped out if the window could be opened just one inch to let in some air. Some might think it even a bit claustrophobic.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have more complimentary items other than soap, shampoo and conditioner... e.g. moisturizer, shower cap, ear plugs, small things but a nice touch especially given the location and price of a higher end hotel. Maybe they are available at the desk?? There was really nothing in the room to tell us about the offerings of the hotel or eateries in the area. The staff should also be more informative of the offerings during check-in, e.g. coffee offered during certain time of day. \r\n\r\nThe valet service is nice, but the valets seem a bit unorganized. Nice people, just not real organized yet.\r\n\r\nI know this establishment has been open for less than a month, so overall it was a nice stay.

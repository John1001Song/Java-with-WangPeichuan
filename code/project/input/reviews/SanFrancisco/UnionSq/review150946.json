The hotel had just opened - it was so new that they didn't yet have permanent signage, and I had trouble finding the place because I wasn't looking for the temporary signage inside the window. The continental breakfast included hot eggs and meat, although the quality was just barely enjoyable. Overall it was clean and new, but no-frills. Perfect for a trip where you want a clean and comfortable room downtown, but won't be spending much time in the hotel.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"Being a brand new hotel (or maybe a remodel?), everything was clean and new.

A few days after checking out I noticed a charge for $628.64 from Holiday Inn Express.  I was double charged for the room.  I called Expedia and they said it was not their fault and to call the hotwl.  Called Holiday Inn Express Union Square and spoke with Marcelo who told me that someone made a mistake and it should have been charged to third party \"Expedia\", but only th manager Raj can fix it.  He said he would email Raj to fix it and call me back.  Raj never has called so I filled a dispute with my credit card company.  Neither Expedia nor Holiday Inn Express seem to want to fix the problem...stressful to the customer and poor customer service!!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"R","userLocation":"San Francisco ","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-02-23T12:52:41Z","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}],"userDisplayName":"","roomTypeId":201271308,"isUnverified":false,"isFlaggable":false,"isRecommended":"NO"}]}}}

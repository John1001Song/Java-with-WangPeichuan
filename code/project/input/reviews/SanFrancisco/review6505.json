We had a city view king rather than a bay view, but you get both views from the sky bridge anyway.  The view is dramatic, all the way to the Golden Gate Bridge (if its not foggy)  and only for guests!  The hotel itself has a more residential apartments feel than a hotel, with little in the way of lobby/bars etc and its all very quiet.  The furniture and fittings are a little dated in places, but the bed was very comfy,  it was very clean and room service was lightening fast.  Staff were all helpful and overall it felt like a well run and welcoming place.  Each Friday and Saturday at 5pm they offer free drinks to residents on the 40th floor terrace.  Its worth going to take in the views and that bracing San Francisco breeze!  - on the downside, if its foggy in town you are so high up you cant see the ground...","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"That view,  and the professional service.","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"In the financial district so limited dining options close by at the weekend.

We appreciated late check out (we had a late International flight) and use of hotel facilities until we departed for airport. Room was AMAZING.  Incredible views from the Bridge to Bridge room.  I agree with other reviews - pay the extra and book this room, you will not be disappointed. Housekeeping do a wonderful job, room spotlessly clean and always stocked with high quality amenities and complimentary water - with chocolates at turndown.  We chose to have two dinners in room (5 night stay) as we had the best view in San Francisco. Dinner was fanastic and exceeded our expectations.  We also used the house car, this is a great extra provided by the hotel and the drivers provide wonderful service and are very knowledgable re the Bay Area. The staff at this hotel are exceptional, some of the best service we have received. They are professional and knowledgable and somehow manage to create a 'boutique' hotel experience in a large, luxury hotel.

I traveled with my husband and chose this hotel because of location, ranking on TripAdvisor and amenities. We were not disappointed. We had a Jr. Suite with a Golden Gate view which was to die for on the 39th floor. My husband used the gym and thought it was more up-to-date than the Planet Fitness facility he uses at home. The business center is small but serviceable. The hotel staff was fantastic and their recommendation for dining, day excursions, travel route, even parking was always spot on and invaluable. Given our short stay, we needed to bat 1000 on all that we did and working with the hotel staff helped us achieve that goal. I would surely return to the Loews Regency if I get the opportunity to travel to San Francisco again and I'll definitely recommend this hotel to all my family and friends.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"Location, room views and staff","negativeRemarks":"Pricing.

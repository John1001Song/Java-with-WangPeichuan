You may have a certain level of anxiety staying there.  In order to increase security, though, they have installed many, bright security lights.  You should expect to see many people there with various backgrounds.  The walls in the room are painted in a stucco fashion.  The carpet in my room has seen better days.  The bathroom was ok except for the placement of the bathroom tissue holder (very inconvenient).  The cleaning staff made the bed but afterward did not want to replace the thin, decorative bed accent at the foot of the bed.  Also, they changed the towels but were regularly reluctant to empty the trash or vacuum the floors as necessary.  I did, however, see someone spot check some of the rooms.  Moreover, as in other posts, I smelled cigarette and other smoke that came into my room although all windows and doors were closed.  So, while you may have asked for a non-smoking room, you may come into contact with it anyway.  Additionally, I had to request an ironing board but received a small ironing board that lays on the bed.  You should, moreover, expect to pay the full costs of your stay at the time of check-in.  I will say that the hotel office staff were very helpful.  The upside of the hotel is knowing that they are currently renovating/modernizing the rooms and exterior.  Check back with them in a year or eighteen months and perhaps the accommodations will be better.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"Since it was in a suburb of a major city, the price was low in comparison to costs in the city or near main attractions.

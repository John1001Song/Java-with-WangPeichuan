Making this hotel an economical alternative to potentially expensive downtown San Francisco hotels.  \r\nThis is a \"suite\" hotel giving you a small kitchen area with fridge, stove, sink, dishes, etc.  If you plan to stay in San Francisco for a few to several days, this is a great home base to travel from.

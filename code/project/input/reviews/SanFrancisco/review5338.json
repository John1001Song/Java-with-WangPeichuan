We walked just about everywhere we needed to be.  The hotel staff were very kind and accommodating. We parked just a block behind the hotel, however when we went to pick up our vehicle on the last day there were an enormous amount of people waiting there for rentals and pickups.  One of the hotel deskmen had walked up to the garage, saw us standing there after checking out and offered to hold our bags for us until we could pick up our vehicle later that day (which was the plan anyways).   I found that one small gesture from the hotel staff to be so wonderfully kind and considerate of our time.  The hotel was clean and well kept, the bathrooms are insanely small and the shower is a bit hard to maneuver in due to the tight space but nonetheless it was clean and served it's purpose.  We were able to enjoy the 5pm wine tasting which was a great way to unwind.  The TV sets in the rooms are a little outdated - while they are flat screens there were no place for a USB plug.  Also, there was only one outlet to use to charge our phone and it was on the other side of the room under the desk.  All in all the minor inconveniences were grossly insignificant to the quality of our stay and I would stay at this hotel again.

The location is excellent. It is a block from Chinatown, about 5 blocks from Market Street and there is cable car stop down the block. The staff are also incredibly nice! I requested to change rooms (I was unlucky and my room had a bad view) and they were quick to do so. While I was out they moved my bags into another room for no additional cost. The hotel also provide shuttle service to the airport for about $15 a person. This ride saved my life! And best of all, there's free wine (good wine too)! The downside is that this hotel isn't the best for those with children. The atmosphere is more adult-like and there is no pool.

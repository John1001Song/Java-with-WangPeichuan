In fact, it's a comfortable place with pool and laundry room and whatever, but so what when it takes 2 hours to get to San Francisco? You have to catch a bus into San Rafael (or walk 45mins!) and then another to go to San Francisco. And each bus seems to come once an hour! Matching the bus which will get you back from San Rafael to the hotel is a matter requiring careful research, because nobody walks in America! \r\n\r\nRoom cleaning was but once a week (they failed to remove our box of recycling) and WIFI unsecured, but all the same, the staff were friendly and helpful, the coffee and muffins - though very basic - were as fine a way to breakFAST! as one could wish, and there's a lovely bayside walk in 5-10 mins walk, and the San Rafael bus depot can get you into the swelteirng wine country.  \r\n\r\n","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"Helpful staff, spacious room, shower area and price for all that.","negativeRemarks":"The toilets were weird - shallow bowl, water very close to one's botty - and the annnoying location, too far even from the town centre.

Then the 2nd room only had one bed when we booked 2 queens for 4 of us. The third room was fine but really disappointed there wasn't even a cofee maker. The guy working was very nice. Trash outside when we first walked in was overflowing. Overall it was OK.  Would pay a bit more for something a bit nicer with full breakfast and a coffee pot!

When you book your room, look for a \"deal\" that includes parking, I saved $25 by doing that. #2, Uber is a BIG help, leave your car at the hotel and use Uber. The amount of $$$ you pay for parking around town will be about the same. The only other thing I would add would be the $22 for breakfast in the morning. They really should offer SOMETHING, but for the price of the stay it might cost them too much, it IS San Francisco after all ;P","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"S","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-06-03T13:57:21Z","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}],"userDisplayName":"","roomTypeId":36402,"isUnverified":false,"isFlaggable":false,"isRecommended":"YES"},{"hotelId":"693658","totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"photos":[],"reviewId":"574de0faa82dae09fa1e2286","itinId":"1127303254437","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[{"userNickname":"Assistant General Manager","displayLocale":"en_us","isFlaggable":true,"date":"2016-06-01T10:04:20Z","response":"Thank you for taking the time to review the Courtyard San Francisco Downtown.

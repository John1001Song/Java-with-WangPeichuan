Our room (two double beds) was a bit cramped, but matched our needs perfectly. The hotel staff at check-in and check-out were friendly, courteous, and efficient. There was parking at a moderate extra cost, but well worth it. After a long day of driving, we chose to eat at the hotel restaurant/bar. The food was pretty good, but the service wasn't great.

While not unusual in a downtown hotel, this was not downtown and was not mentioned until we arrived.  In addition, since I was there to visit my child, their car could not be driven to visit us without a parking fee unless she stayed less than 20 minutes (the complimentary maximum time), since there was no other parking in the area.   Stayed in a double room and it was a little cramped, particularly around the desk.   While the hotel was not cheap, it was one of the more reasonably priced, although the websites had one price in the adds and the actual multi-night price was higher in that the low price (in the adds) listed was wrong on the website and then the price did not apply for all nights of the stay, ie, some nights were much higher.

What I did not understand was, why did they build the hotel with one side facing I-80 & the other facing the water. (North/South exposure) They could have built the hotel with an East/West exposure and both sides would still have a view of the water, but limited noise from the thousands of cars that are a stone's throw from the hotel. Or used double pane windows to cut down on the expected noise.\nThe food at the Hilton was just ok. The food at the nearby Chevy's was just ok. A small bottle of Nestle's water was over $2. Parking was $10.50 per night. The room was clean, but when I picked up one of the hand towels, it looked liked someone had just shined a pair of brown shoes with it.\n\nThe staff was friendly.\n\nBest thing and worst thing was convenience to I-95.

The earliest they could get someone to the room would be Sunday afternoon. They repaired the Internet line but not until Sunday evening. After being a silver card holder for quite sometime I would think I would deserve better service? As for the parking, it kept the unwanted cars out but not the prostitutes! Saturday night there was one wandering outside the lobby entrance. I don't know if there was a change of franchise ownership or they just don't care? I suggest if they want to secure the parking then why not charge visitors instead of the paying hotel guests.

Again I detected an attitude and absolutely nothing was done. !5 minutes later I called again, and another person helped me. She called the adjoining room, and the TV was immediately lowered. YOu get nothing,beyond the basics, no continental breakfastor complimentary wine. If you just need a place to sleep, bring ear plugs, and this place will do in a pinch.As for me, next time I'll try another hotel even though this hotel has the best location for my particular needs.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Beacon, New York","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-01-23T07:01:06Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"10323","reviewId":"18831952","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Brian","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Excellent hotel","reviewText":"Atmosphere is excellent, room very comfortable, good value","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-01-09T01:29:22Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"10323","reviewId":"18831951","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Marques","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great Deal For The Bay!!","reviewText":"I absolutely loved my time at the Hilton in Emeryille!!

The location is great; it was a landmark. We stayed there many times in spite of some issues with the rooms and amenities because of its convenience. With new ownership, the higher quality of the furnishings and overall improvement in cleanliness and comfort was quite obvious. However, there are some things we didn't like. First, there is an overpowering perfumy smell in the halls which, thankfully, didn't seep into the room. Second, the previously-working hi-speed wireless service was no longer functioning. Since my husband and I both had our laptops with us expecting the same service, we were disappointed at the lack of internet connection. But for the most part, the hotel is worth it for the same reason we liked it before: the location and the ease of free parking in a large, secure lot. This last is a major plus.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Ashland, Oregon","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-05-12T01:13:48Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"10323","reviewId":"18831937","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Kelley","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great Location","reviewText":"The location was centralized to the areas we needed to be.

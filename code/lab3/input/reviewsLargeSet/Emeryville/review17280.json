Parking is plentiful.  The hotel is very close to the highway and it is across the street from a number of diners as well as a shopping plaza.  The lobby looks nice and the staff is very attentive.  That is where it ends unfortunately for me.\r\n\r\nWe booked for a two double bed room and the staff were very helpful with the check-in process.  The room is adequately clean.  However, the fixtures and lighting of the room is deplorable.  The hotel lobby and the rest of the hotel looks like it was designed by two separate teams.  Once you exit the elevators on to your floor, you feel as if you were transported to the 1970's with bone white colored walls.  They use cool light CFL bulbs in the room which makes the room unnecessarily dreary amber and dull.  Unless you get direct light into your room, the room will look as if you are stuck in a dark and depressing place with brown carpet.  Come on, bone white walls and brown carpet?   \r\n\r\nMy room is situated on the third floor which has a vending machine as well as an ice machine.  I would not go near the ice machine as it looks dingy and has not been cleaned for a very long time.  You can actually see black specks which can be mildew.  I cannot believe that after paying over $200 a night for a room, i ended up checking into something that makes a half star motel look regal.  \r\n\r\nThe only saving grace of this hotel is the staff which is wonderful.

I know we were only going to sleep in the hotel room, but we wanted something a little better than a motel. So last year (Aug 2011), we stayed at the Garden Hilton Hotel that's across the street. They DID NOT have free Wifi INSIDE the room. It was only available in the lobby. What an inconvenience that was!!\n\nSo this year (Aug 2012), we stayed at the Four Points Sheraton and we loved it! Price was very reasonable and they had free Wifi INSIDE the rooms! Plus, they have free coffee service in the lobby until 10am. Be sure to get some before 10am.\n\nThe room is clean and we loved the warm comforters and the free bottle of Arrowhead water in the room.\n\nThere's a Trader Joe's market across the street, as well as a discount clothing store called Ross and a discount shoe store too. We bought my niece some school clothes there. The hotel is located close to the freeway, but you could not hear the freeway noise. The hotel is pretty close to UC Berkeley (about 7 minutes away).

The business center is a tiny room with a printer, copier, 2 terminals and thats about it. Better bring your USB cord because they dont have any. Fortunately, there's a Kinkos 2 blocks away.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Carlsbad, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-11-02T14:29:41Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"17280","reviewId":"18252963","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Alli","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Small but clean and nice","reviewText":"Our room was clean and comfortable, the staff was friendly and the location was great with quick access to Berkeley campus and the Bay bridge.

Very easy to get to SF.  Right by a new mall so there are plenty of restaurant choices near by along with shopping in walking distance.  Based on the size of the hotel, the hotel restaurant was not great, but not a big deal.  My room was incorrectly booked with 1 king versus 2 doubles.  Clerk upgraded the room to bay view free of charge.  One other note, bay view rooms are really not worth anything unless above the 4th floor (there is only 7 floors on this hotel).","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Columbus Ohio","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-04-19T20:01:04Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"17280","reviewId":"18252966","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Harjinder","brandType":"Expedia","title":"good hotel","reviewText":"great location, easy to get to S.F. only 15 min. away.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Livermore, Ca","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-01-18T04:07:05Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"17280","reviewId":"18253007","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Nancy","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Top-notch!","reviewText":"Overall I had a terrific experience at the Four Points by Sheraton in Emeryville.

Other than the hassle of traveling to a new hotel and coming back to Hyatt the next day, I was taken good care of. My stay was for 3 nights. Hyatt only charged me for one night. They covered all my expenses at Courtyard. Also I had a pet dog and they waived the pet fee. So overall, they made amends for the initial hassle. I was also upgraded to a better room when I came back to the hotel the next day. Breakfast was good, the staff is excellent and the hotel is in a very good condition. I travel a lot and I am comparing this hotel to other similar places of stay.

Then there's the typical business hotel spaces: a room with a PC and printer, a fitness center with a couple machines, and a pool. Everything here is DIY: guests taxi their own bags with luggage carts, do thier own laundry in the coin-operated machines or the bathtub, and make their own meals using the in-room kitchen stocked with pots, dishes, tableware, dish soap, etc. This place is compatible for the independent type who doesn't want a hotel to dictate how they stay, or how much they spend on overpriced hotel meals, but don't expect high-end or luxury for the high prices.

So, I booked three nights at the Haytt house. First the good news. The staff is excellent. Friendly and professional, I'd say overall one of the best I've encountered. The rooms are very nice, no complaints here. The cable tv that the hotel has going into the rooms is local with no upgrade options so unless you have brought a computer or a dvd player and some disks, you better hope you have a good book. No room service. Although the property has a full service restaurant, they don't offer room service. This to me is a big strike against them.

We were surprised by the décor of the room, it was the largest room we stayed in during our vacation, really nice! There was a train behind the building, but it didn't bother us at all. The bed was clean & comfortable, as was the bathroom & full service kitchen. We will definitely stay here again & wished we could have stayed longer. Parking is free! The restaurant served delicious food, service was great & the complimentary breakfast was the best we've had!!\nEveryone at the hotel was helpful & kind. We wanted to leave our bags there while we visited San Francisco, they were accommodating & told us we could pick them up whenever we wished.

After reading all of the reviews and the prices of the 4 major hotels in the area we agreed that we'll be ok with a hotel that is not great but not very expensive. So, we used the \"Unpublished rates\" service of Expedia and we got the Hyatt at half price. It is exactly how much it's worth at this time. As you already know from other reviews it's located next to the Amtrak station and you can hear the trains even if you are on the top floor (as in our case). The first train next morning went through at 03:25 h AM. This proximity can be viewed both ways if you are going to use the Amtrak. As it was previously mentioned in other reviews, the hotel needs repairs and renovations which were still not done at this time (May, 2012). They can probably start with changing the carpets - they are in worse condition than much cheaper motels - but they are also other areas that need repairs. If you read this a year or so later they might have done it then. The restaurant was a pleasant surprise - it was inexpensive and both food and service were of excellent quality.

This was a very good hotel for the price. We wanted to visit San Francisco and the surrounding area and were very pleased with the hotel. The hotel has just undergone a change, they are not longer Woodfin but Hyatt. I am not sure what that means for future guests, but I think they are moving away from the \"self-catering\" aspect. Breakfast was included which was a nice surprise, with a reasonable good selection. Overall for what we paid (in the lower tier of the mainstream hotels in the area) this was more than we expected. Getting to San Francisco was not a problem, the Bay Bridge is 3 minutes away and there was a bus that took under 25 minutes into San Francisco. There is a very nice food court within walking distance from the hotel with a nice selection of international and American choices. Within that area was also a small convenience store. There is a grocery store about 5-6 minutes walk from the hotel.\n\nSome small negative things (that didn't bother us too much): Not a great view, freeway on one side, train station on the other. The noise issue wasn't bad at all for us being on the 7th floor.

Having stayed there, I don't know what the complaints were about. Wonderful service, comfort, and convenience. Unless you're expecting the Ritz, you won't be disappointed. Very pleased with our stay at the Woodfin Suites in Emeryville.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Clifton Park, NY","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-07-24T06:05:45Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"547988","reviewId":"20087676","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Viv","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Comfortable and roomy","reviewText":"Clean, comfortable and spacious.

It's very convenient to doing any work in the Emeryville area with easy acess to the Bay Bridge or I-80 East. However, the restaurant was mediocre at best. The food was not up to Bay Area standards for even a business hotel. I had two breakfasts and one lunch, and one breakfast of fresh fruit was not edible. The service in the restaurant was poor and lacked the professionalism usually found at Bay Area spots. I'd stay at Woodfin again but walk to Peets for coffee in the morning and definitely not try to have a business lunch there.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Lake Tahoe, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-12-19T13:19:50Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"547988","reviewId":"20087627","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Dan","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Very nice place to stay!","reviewText":"The only complaint we had was that the resaraunt was understaffed.

It's conveniently located right off of the highway, so easy access on/off hwy. Since it's just before the bay bridge, you're only minutes away from San Francisco, Berkeley, and Oakland. The hotel is clean, roomy,service is professional, and even though it's next to the Amtrak station, we only heard the train once, and then not very loudly.

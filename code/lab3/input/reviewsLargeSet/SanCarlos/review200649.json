The gentleman who checked us in, muddled through the process, taking quite a long time to process a reservation that had been prepaid. Our room was out-dated and extremely dark. However, unless we wanted a smoking room, no other rooms were available. In all fairness the room was clean and had been freshly painted. However, when we retired for the night we noticed the sheets were stained, thread-bare and very scratchy. We would have switched hotels, but by this time there was little availability and the cost was ridiculous. We had booked for a two night stay. The room had not been serviced, perhaps as it was an extended-stay. I ended up purchasing a set of sheets for us to sleep on. The bed was also hard and uncomfortable. We could hear every sound from the hall way and as we were on the street level, we were unable to open our drapes for more light, as we were located near the front of the hotel and could see everyone entering the hotel.

The bed was rock hard - camping is seriously more comfortable than the bed. The pillows were ok, but 1 sheet and a very thin blanket didn't cut it. Also, even though the room had temperature controls, they didn't work. When I called the front desk, I was told that the room temps were perfect and I would adjust. Well, I didn't and froze all night long. Don't expect much for toiletries - a bar of soap was all they provide. TV choices are extremely limited. Make sure you have breakfast plans.

No toothpaste in the rooms, decaffeinated coffee in room with a non working telephone to call guest service. Bath tub looked like it could be been better cleaned. We had a King suite but no balcony. Did not try the free breakfast was never up early enough. Those were the cons. For pros it served its purpose a place to sleep and had ample parking and free wifi. About two blocks away there is a 24 hour fitness gym.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"not for less than a week stay","locationRemarks":"easy to find gym nearby","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Fresno, CA, USA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2013-05-27T20:12:20Z","roomTypeId":222446,"userDisplayName":"Kimberly","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"200649","reviewId":"52697331","photos":[],"itinId":"157856570872","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Andy","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Good Hotel","reviewText":"The hotel was very well priced and comfortable.

Large TV was wall mounted but on an arm that let you pull out and rotate as needed. Oh, and the TVs have Apple TV's hooked up to them so you can use AirPlay from your iOS devices and watch on the big screen! Bit of construction going on nearby, but I couldn't hear anything from my room. There's a trolley stop right in front of the hotel, so if you want to ride that, it's perfect. Close to shopping and lots of sights nearby. Hotel staff was great when I had to interact with them and were generally pretty quick at getting cars out of valet - though I would call 15 minutes or so ahead if you are in a rush so you don't have to wait.

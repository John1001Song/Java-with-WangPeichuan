Thus, we started out great - incredible price for a 4 star hotel in a great location - plus an upgraded room.   The service staff is impeccable, they treat you like a king.   \r\n\r\nHowever, disappointment reigned after.  I had to move the bed to get to an electrical outlet.   I was horrified.  Dirt and massive amounts of hair were on the carpet and baseboard behind the bed.  It probably hasn't been moved since it was installed.  On my night table was a bose sound system which is a nice touch.  However, the unit is huge and it is bolted to the night table!  For a 4 star hotel it seems awkward and insulting. For a $300  per night hotel, they should treat their guests with more dignity than assuming they will steal a $150 alarm clock.  It made me feel cheap.\r\n\r\nWhile the bed was very comfortable, the rest of the room was old and worn out.  The couch and chairs in the room were worn out, the arms were almost bare from use.   Last, the elevator experience is not fun.  They have only three for a large hotel, and they are old school small.   If you are on a middle floor, it is very difficult to get on the elevator.  The issue stems from their penthouse bar, it is a tourist trap that eats up elevator usage.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the room issues made the hotel stay unacceptable.

After going to our room, we wanted to go up to the top floor to the restaurant for some food, drinks, and an excellent '360•view'. The elevator would not take us there! Apparently the restaurant was closed for a private party. What a huge disappointment. This was the entire reason why I booked this hotel. So we had to go elsewhere.

Breakfast was pricey. Note gratuity is included and clearly marked. Front desk and concierge staff were amazing, as was room service cashier--both went out of their way to accommodate all our needs. Must have fabulous insulation, as it was very cold outside, but the room was a constant comfortable. Was never able to get room cooler for sleeping though. I guess it was only set to heat so could only circulate room air below the current temp. No big deal. Lovely bathroom and bedding, comfortable bed. We got a great price on Expedia, plus inexpensive upgrade at front desk. Parking overnight is $60 so use cabs and streetcars or walk while in town. $6-$10 to the wharf/pier. BART is good for other places. For distance travel Avis (and Budget) is a 5 block downhill walk away, to rent a car for a day . . . . $31 on their own website vs. $70 on Expedia. The hotel had all the toiletries, but there's a little gift store in hotel across the street or Walgreens 2 blocks steeply downhill for pain relievers, etc. Our favorite breakfast was the Blue Mermaid down near the piers/wharf. Alcatraz was wonderful, but go early to miss crowds and buy ticket a few days in advance. New Oakland bridge portion so worth driving through. Alcatraz much better than I thought it would be, self-guided audio amazing, but buy tickets a few days in advance and go on the early boat and during week if possible, to avoid crowds.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"Classy, upscale.","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"Muir Forest (redwoods), Sausalito, Carmel, 17 mile drive (Pebble Beach), new Oakland Bridge, Ghiradlli's chocolate.","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2013-12-05T00:08:21Z","roomTypeId":274573,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"24620","reviewId":"62797651","photos":[],"itinId":"164726190375","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Wonderful Stay at the Top of the Hill","reviewText":"The staff was very friendly and it was in a great central location.

What sets it apart for us is the grandness of the place yet it feels like a small boutique hotel with excellent, personal service. If you want the massive, impressive lobby, restaurants, bars and other amenities (like movies on demand for instance) you'll need to stay across the street at the Fairmont....but you'll also have the large crowds to deal with and less personal service. When staying at the Mark, I highly suggest upgrading to the Club Lounge which can be done at check-in for $30 per person per night. In fact, I probably wouldn't stay at the Mark if I didn't upgrade because it makes up for the lack of amenities. The Club Lounge is a great peaceful, elegant retreat just off the lobby. Some of the Club Lounge amenities include a breakfast buffet, afternoon tea and sweets, evening Hors d'oeuvres with complimentary cocktails, beer, wine, bottled water, soft drinks, and juices all day long.\n\nOur only issue during our five-night stay was one morning there was no hot water so the showers were quick and refreshing. The Front Desk manager sent up a bottle of wine with his apologies. Truthfully, this happened to us on one of our previous stays and the room rate was cut in half for one night (we didn't ask for more compensation but maybe shoud have).\n\nWe had Christmas Dinner at the famous Top of the Mark Restaurant and Lounge; it was too pricey for mediocre buffet food.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Palm Springs, CA, USA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2013-01-03T19:55:43Z","roomTypeId":274570,"userDisplayName":"Dr. Rick","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Other","categoryLabel":"Couples & Business Travel"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"24620","reviewId":"42805106","photos":[],"itinId":"153042891695","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":2,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"No hot water available.","reviewText":"There was no hot water available for shower.

The beds had a cheap, flimsy mattress pad to soften the hardness. The bathroom toilet flushed LOUDLY. It needs repair. One bathroom vanity sink faucet dripped. The room cooling/heating system is very slow. The hotel apparently has a new policy of attracting cruise ship guests to it's list of customers. They packed the hotel. High school prom parties at the Mark? One of those happened as well. Finally, our two son's and their families stayed the same night and each were disappointed. One got room service food but it wasn't what they ordered and was poor qualiy. Thier meal wasn't deducted from the bill! The desk staff gave them an excuse. My other son ordered room service and it never arrived!

As soon as you arrive at their entrance you know there's alot of history to this place. The check in was convenient and staff was very helpful.

I did take a chance and asked the check in staff whether they can change us to a higher floor with a better view. They said they could upgrade me for an add'l 20/day..which i declined but anyway they had nothing available. The rooms are very nice good size with big bathroom. 1st nite, after a full day out, we came home and ran the shower..pulled on the shower handle, it came off... came out and pulled on the bathroom handle, it came off also. It was quite funny actually but we called downstairs and they sent someone up with 5 minutes to fix it...it was fine..it's an hold historical hotel..it happens. The bathroom is very nice but beware there is absolutely no water pressure in the shower but then the toilet will suck a small child in..go figure! The hotel is within 3 blocks to chinatown and union square..very convenient. but you must hike up hill back to the hotel..I work out 3-4 x per week ( hi intensity cardio and toning) and i was tired from the hike.

We were looking forward to having a great time and an equally great of a stay in the Mark Hopkins. Unfortunately, we would be sadly disappointed. We paid for an upgraded room on the 17th floor. Unfortunately, the hotel's bar/club was only two floors above and we were kept awake by the loud music until 12:30 every night we were there. On top of that, the walls were paper thin and we listened to a guy next door who we swore was going to cough up a lung. This coughing fit went on for at least an hour and a half every night as well.\n\nThe beds were not very comfortable and the pillows didn't provide much support for your head at all. My wife and I had extreme difficulties getting any kind of restful sleep during our stay.\n\nThe AC unit in the room wouldn't turn on until it was at least 5 degrees above the temperature we set it at, and when you tried to over-ride it and put the fan on it would only stay on for a minimum amount of time. Needless to say, my wife and I were up and down countless times during the night turning it back on because the room became very warm, esepcially the weekend we were there which they had temperatures in the 80's!\n\nWhen we checked out and I told the front desk agent about our issues he looked at me and aid \"oh well.\" I was so offended and couldn't beleive the horrible service we had received.

First of all, I knew that when I booked through expedia that I was going to be in a room on one of the lower floors. I called to request a higher floor and was given a complimentary upgrade from the the 5th floor to the 9th floor. Although it was a bigger room, it was a smoking floor. Something I was willing to deal with to get away from the road noise. Ahhh the road noise. If you don't mind the quaint sound of the cable car most of the night, you won't have a problem, but it was substantial. That, coupled with what felt like paper-thin walls made for mostly restless nights. Another minor issue I had was the daily charge for internet use. Are you joking me? When you charge a certain premium for a room, wouldn't you expect complimentary high-speed internet. All in all. The Hop is a classy hotel with a great location, history, and service, but I was left disappointed with my overall experience.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Seattle","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-09-21T01:00:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"24620","reviewId":"18158066","photos":[],"itinId":"248249242","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Natasha","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Intercontinental Mark Hopkins Hotel","reviewText":"There was a $50.00 a night parking fee!!

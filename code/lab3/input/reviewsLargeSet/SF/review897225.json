This particular location was not up to par with others.   Construction in the lobby and next door were distracting but we understand that it is part of life and do not hold that against the hotel.   However, a smiling face after traveling all night would be nice.  We checked in around 11 pm.  Had it been earlier (or if we could have gotten our money back) we would have definitely moved on once we saw the room.    Personality of the gal at check in was non-existent.  The room reminded me of an old hotel and in desperate need of updating.  Kitchen was dingy,  appliances have seen better days, dishes chipped, utensils worn.  The \"living area\" was small, adequate for a short stay but no where near the quality or size of other Homewood Suites.  Other Homewood Suites that we stayed at had the most comfortable beds and comforters.   Not at this place.  Beds were just OK comfort wise but neither I nor my husband felt comfortable at this location.  Breakfast selection was mediocre to adequate (not expecting a gourmet meal.)  The only staff that was pleasant and seemed happy was the gentleman in the breakfast area.  We left immediately after breakfast.

The lobby was inviting with fresh coffee, tea and hot chocolate always waiting.  The front desk attendant was sweet and helpful.  The room was clean and the set up was perfect for our needs.  I chose a king with a pull out sofa suite.  Which was perfect for our needs.  I stayed with my two daughters.  We felt safe and it was reasonably quiet.  The view was of the roof top so you may want to ask for a room at the end near the street and the bay.  They may be priced higher though for the view.  Not sure.  The room had a full size fridge, dishes, utensils, microwave, toaster, etc.  It was really quite nice if you want to make your meals in your room and save money.  San Fran is very expensive if you are eating out.  I don't think we ate for less than $65 for the 3 of us at any restaurant.  We didn't want to go to McDonald's on our trip though.  The parking is ample and not crowded.  The beds and pillows were fine although it could have had an extra blanket rather than a thin coverlet.  The breakfast, included with your stay, was pretty good... fruits, yogurt, cereal, hot food (eggs, sausage, bacon, biscuits and gravy) and a waffle maker, to name a few.  Pool is only 3 fet deep.  No hot tub but rights to use the hot tub at the Double Tree next door.  Overall, probably the best value you can find in the San Fran area.

We've chosen room 129 on the 1st floor (right across from the pool, and from the back exit, and the back parking lot). This queen suit with a kitchenette was very clean; there were full-size refrigerator, microwave, dishes, silverware, dishwasher+detergent, paper towels, coffeemaker, individual packs of coffee and condiments, even a free pack of microwavable popcorn; there were a stove top, and a pot and a pan which we didn't get to use). The breakfast buffet offered plenty of food, including hot items, though you should try to go there earlier (after 8 am there was a line both days, and people had to wait for some items to be refilled). Three things to mention about this particular room: since it is so close to the eating area, the room fills with all those breakfast smells in the morning; there is a service laundry room on the left - when we came for a break during the day, we could hear the big washers spinning, but in the evening it was quiet; the 1st night we had to call the front desk because of noises from the room above, but the manager took care of it very quickly, and the next day we even got an apology note and a chocolate bar from him.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"Clean room, kitchenette, pool, breakfast","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"Near airport, 6 mi from downtown, Tanforan mall and restaurants nearby, Pacifica beach","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Sacramento, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2013-07-08T20:37:57Z","roomTypeId":200260327,"userDisplayName":"Mom","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Families","categoryLabel":"Families"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"897225","reviewId":"54491270","photos":[],"itinId":"159376369467","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Yury","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Good value hotel but service was terrible!","reviewText":"We arrived at the hotel on July 5 at approximately 9:15 p.m. We had to wait in line for the front desk for about 10 minutes.

In Sonoma, have lunch at Sunflower Cafe in square, they have wonderful garden patio in back. Our favorite dinner out in San Francisco was Ana Mandara in Ghiradellii square. Drive Great Hwy thru Persidio park - awesome views of Golden Gate and Pacific ocean near Cliff House. We found buying a tour on the hop on/hop off buses to be very helpful and efficient way to see the city, however, even tho they look the same at first glance there are several different tour operators, look closely and compare before you buy.

Our 3-year old slept on the sofa-bed. The building itself looks like it must be rather new, if not recently renovated. Location is a bit quirky...pushed to the edge of the bay by the San Bruno State Park, it's on a narrow strip of land that accommodates US-101, a marina and other hotels, so that doesn't leave much room for anything else. If you want to go out for dinner you'll need to drive to Brisbane (or somewhere further if you want). Bring your GPS or a good map to get you there, especially for night-time driving since there is no lighting to speak of along Sierra Point Parkway and its a bit disorienting to find yourself surrounded by water without many visual reference points in the dark.\n\nBreakfast would have probably been better if it hadn't been so mobbed.

Two TV's were nice as was the small, but adequate, indoor swimming pool and fitness center. A full breakfast is provided everyday, (tho' the dining area is small)- eggs, bacon, corned beef hash one day and sausage the other, fried potatoes, fresh fruit, dry cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, make-your-own waffle, bread and bagels for toast w/cream cheese or real butter. If you happen to be there Mon - Thurs, a dinner is served (don't know if there is a charge and the menu is fixed - but in your room so you know in advance what will be served). Very clean and microwave popcorn, coffe & tea were in the room when we arrived. Enough dishes, etc. for four. I would go back if I need to be in the S.F. area again. Note: It is very difficult to figure out how to get to the facility from the freeway. Call and get directions before you go or download a map/driving directions.

We had a nice little corner view of the bay bridge! It seems like the amenities in the room have been upgraded recently. The thing that could have been better is the water pressure in the shower but overall it was a great stay. The location is pretty good. Let's be honest SF has a huge homeless problem and in the financial district there are considerably less than union square and the sort. The hotel was withing walking distance of the piers and markets near the bay bridge and made for a nice walk down. There are coffee shops all around this hotel. If you are looking to go out at night the Uber rides will cost you around 20 dollars to get to the popular local bars, so not bad. One thing to note about parking is there is a parking garage on battery street withing a 30 second walk of the hotel. I think it was $34 dollars for 24 hours but I got it for $25 (no in and out privilege however) using an app called spot hero. The valet at the hotel charges $65 and parks in the same structure (they do allow in and out).

The protest was carefully carried out within the letter of the law as set down by both Federal and City ordinances, and we are unable to interfere with the protestors’ legal rights.  Also, it is true that they were at the property for a three days this week, but prior to this, they were not here for months.

In fact, our Associate Opinion Survey came in at 93% associate satisfaction for 2015.  None of the protestors that have protested in front of our hotel are associates of our hotel. We compensate our associates well and provide complimentary meals, affordable health insurance for them and their families, a 401K with a company match, and three days of Zumba (complimentary) in support of their health and wellness.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWe do sincerely wish there was more we could to support our guests and associates in these instances, and we are truly sorry that you were disturbed.

We were looking forward to a nice hotel and weekend away. The location is great. Lobby was nice with an adjacent bar with great drinks and snacks. At first glance the room was impressive. We were located by the elevator which was loud with people coming and going late at night. The bathroom was poorly planned. A light over the toilet and one in the shower. No light over the vanity which made it incredibly hard to see. The bathroom door was clunky and didn't close all of the way. No privacy whatsoever. On the 2nd day after an uncomfortable, hot night we discovered our thermostat didn't work - on our way out we reported it to the front desk. The asked when they could have someone show us how to use it. Clearly that was not the problem.......an engineer went in to fix it and they left a msg saying it was fixed. Sat night was incredibly loud again being near elevator, but thankfully room was cooler. Upon checkout the agent was gracious and listened to our concerns. She comped our last day's breakfast, which was nice - however the experience and room in this hotel certainly was nowhere near a 4* hotel. if you're looking for a great location this Hotel may be great for you.

I would consider staying at this hotel again but would make allowances for a couple of things. The rooms are very spacious, modern, comfortable and stylish. The bathroom was large and I loved the cleanliness of everything. The restaurant is no longer used. It is now a breakfast only room which was a pity as I chose the hotel due to it having a restaurant as I don't know the city to go find places to eat. This is annoying as Expedia are still showing and labelling as such 11 pictures of the hotel's \"restaurant\". On check-in the noise coming from the very full bar with it's loud tecno music made me ask if that was the entrance to a club. I also had to ask the receptionist to keep repeating her questions as I could not hear fully what she was saying as it was so loud. Turns out the bar doubles as a small menu evening restaurant - far too loud and full for that I'm afraid. The staff were wonderful and attentive and the concierge delightful.

The family in the room next door had a screaming kid which was a serious issue. But my main beef with them was housekeeping. When we arrived, the room was not really clean. The bed was made, and the bathroom clean, but there was an empty water bottle under a chair and a few papers scattered around on the desk and floor. There were no robes, so we called down and were told they were out of them till the next day! On NY Eve day, the room was poorly serviced. Empty glasses and bottles were left in the room.(I put them in the hall) They left a notice on the bed saying no guests, no partying, etc. Would have been nice if they disclosed that before booking rooms over New Years Eve! Regardless, we (quietly) had a few friends over. Drank some champagne and had some munchies. The next day, the room was again \"cleaned\" meaning they made the bed and changed the towels.

The service was rude and brusque at check-in, not at all welcoming. The extremely overpriced wifi service in the rooms did not work (log in page never loaded), and people were using the free wifi in the lobby instead, leading to a crowded, strange, uncomfortable vibe in the lobby inconsistent with the chain's luxury image as people hung around with laptops and pajamas etc. to get online. Finally, although the pictures in this hotel's listings on Expedia made it appear that only one class of room has connecting doors (and we booked a higher class specifically to avoid connecting doors), many of the rooms apparently have connecting doors, which would not be a problem except that they carry noise so clearly and loudly between rooms. The room adjoining ours had a small child or baby whose crying and screaming we could hear through the door for several hours (on our wedding anniversary, no less -- so romantic...). Since we had seen the rude treatment another guest received when asking if there were any other available rooms while we were checking in, we felt that asking to switch rooms might lead to an even less pleasant experience than an infant screaming so loudly it seemed we were in the same room. Obviously, babies cry. That was not our complaint. I fault the hotel for putting an infant in a room with poor sound isolation.

I was told slippers would cost 3USD each, but they eventually sent them up for free. Towels were nothing to write home about, and there was no free breakfast. I did like the fact that they served illy coffee in the morning on the 3rd floor, but I imagine it's not much extra cost to just offer it all day, no? No pool or spa at the location, and in general, the property is showing it's age by just not being modern enough. For example, the in-room CD-player screams turn of the 21st century (but being Nakamachi, the system was still pretty decent), and the cabinets are a bit worn. All of this nit-picking aside though, the hotel was still a very comfortable stay, located in a decent location. At the price we paid, I would certainly recommend it to other people.

However I booked for 3 and I had email conformation of that. She then realized I was correct and then also said rollaways were free for children. But then we had to call to check on it three times and was finally delivered at 10 pm. And they knew we had a four year old. Our studio suite offered no coffe/ tea. We had to pay $2.50 for a tea bag. And no bottled water either. We ended up having to buy 4 bottles at $4.50 each from the front desk.So for a \"nice\" hotel that was. It busy the service was very off. Not helpful at all.

They moved me to a higher floor but the room was decidedly inferior in size to what I booked. I complained at the front desk that the room wasn't satisfactory and reminded them that I pre-paid for the room and therefore ought to have the room promised or be refunded. After some effort the manager stepped in and over-rode the clerk, putting me in the room I had origninally requested. It was a \"city-suite\" and a very nice room.\n\nUnfortunately my problems didn't end there. The walls are paper thin and a group of girls in the room next door were carrying on late into the night. I was amazed at how much noise was coming through the wall. I called the front desk and asked for help, who in turn called the room. It was actaully hilarious to hear a girl answer the phone and act surpirsed at the level of noise. I could hear the whole conversation. After, though they tried to lower their voices, I could still clearly hear more than half of what they were saying.\n\nOverall, the room was excellent and I love staying at the edge of North Beach and the Ebarcadaro, but I won't stay hear again.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Kailua Kona, HI","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-02-22T17:09:51Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Greg","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"11523","reviewId":"18291299","photos":[],"itinId":"355049517","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Michael","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Convenient","reviewText":"A polished place to stay near the Financial District.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"San Diego","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-02-20T00:59:50Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"11523","reviewId":"18291232","photos":[],"itinId":"351547042","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Michael","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Underwhelming Comfort","reviewText":"Great location.

I will be traveling to New York next summer and I will definitely be staying at the Le Meridien in NY because I was so impressed.

The room had quite a few light bulbs out, and the fan in the bathroom didn't work (during showers, ALL of the windows and mirrors in the main room fogged up completely. Contrary to what we read, the restaurant DOES NOT SERVE DINNER.

However, on the weekends, the choices of restaurants (especially since the hotel didn't provide one) is severely limited and poor. Hardly any places are open, even during the day on weekends, and even fewer places were open on a Sunday evening.

The Embacardero Center is right across the street, which makes shopping easy and convenient. We also like that this area of San Francisco is less busy on weekends.\n\nThe hotel is upscale, responsive, and exactly as we expected. Of note, we had checked out of a nearby hotel earlier than expected due to problems with noise and other issues. Le Meridien was a great replacement. It was easy to get to and a breeze to check in. The room was nicely decorated with an enormous bathroom. And, there was even a small balcony right off of the bathroom. My only gripe would be with the sliding bathroom door (which the other hotel had as well). It is weird and not really fully closed; so the privacy is limited when you're in the bathroom. I hope this is not a trend for other hotels. But, even with this oddity, we'd still stay there again for our next visit to San Francisco.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"New York, NY","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-05-23T23:40:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"11523","reviewId":"18291021","photos":[],"itinId":"317814919","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Gail","brandType":"Expedia","title":"\"Ferry\" Convenient","reviewText":"What a great place for a weekend retreat for those of us from the East Bay!

Remote control was quickly fixed (batteries) after a call.\n\nDining: Had brunch at hotel restaurant and ordered room service. Both were a pleasant experience.

The bed was possibly the most comfortable I have ever slept in and the room's furniture was suitable and perfect. The reception staff were friendly and helpful and were very welcoming, although other staff tended to have a slight attitude and when I didn't tip for someone passing me my bag, I thought perhaps they were taking things a bit far! The hotel is excellently located for business and pleasure and is a great point to start your trip from. I only wish they had coffee on demand, rather than just in the mornings or facilities in the room. On the downside, the room wasn't cleaned very thoroughly every day with surfaces being ignored, bins not always emptied, nothing tidied away, towels not replenished etc. Would this stop me from returning?

We had the following issues interfere with enjoying our stay: First and foremost, the valet used an obnoxious train-sounding whistle to signal taxis that was clearly audible from our room at night. We called the front desk to complain about it the first night of our stay and he was asked to stop. Then we had to call the second night too because he was at it again. To my dismay, when I called the front desk the person working there stated, \"well, he has to be able to signal taxis.\" The whistling stopped, but I really resented the defense of this stupid practice voiced to me at 10:30 at night when we were supposed to be sleeping. The other issue was the restaurant. When we went there the first morning, there was no host to greet us and we stood for a while. Then the busman came to play \"host\", and was rude to us while we decided whether we were going to eat there. He clearly had not been trained to play the role he was playing. The service once we got in was excellent. The service from housekeeping was good but uneven with requests. We asked for 4 extra pillows due to orthopedic problems and we were brought only 1.

The granite in the bathroom was most impressive. We graciously received a coffee maker on request for our early morning departure.

I booked a bay view room and got a very nice suite with a separate office and big bathroom. My room 1119 was on the corner of the hotel facing the Bay bridge and also had a nice balcony. The decor is modern, comfortable and very comfy. This is a great hotel, just renovated and very luxurious. The bed was comfortable and the office was a dream. Service was excellent. I noticed that the Nakamichi stereo in the room had a blown speaker. I called the front desk and an engineer was there in under 5 minutes to fix it. He promptly replaced the speaker. While they have a little gym area in the hotel, for a serious workout there is a 24 hour fitness just 2 blocks away. The hotel doesn't have a pool or spa, so 24 Hour Fitness was very convenient for a workout and dip in the hot tub. Also the Embarcadero transportation hub is really close. Its an easy walk to restaurants on Columbus or over to the Embarcadero area. There is also a small art house cinema next door with 5 theaters so that's handy. The concierge staff was very helpful and recommended some great restaurants. Parking is extremely expensive, but about the same as other SF hotels. Only negatives were the lack of a spa in the hotel and a bit of street noise (sirens, loud motorcycles) but I think this is par for an urban hotel. I highly recommend this hotel for business travelers or those on a SF vacation.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Anaheim, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2006-08-24T04:07:59Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"11523","reviewId":"18291001","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Chad","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Very impressed","reviewText":"Hotel is very clean and very nice.

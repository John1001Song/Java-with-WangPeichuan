The bathroom was small but very functional. The lobby bar was always busy and seemed like a nice hangout for the area. Also the starlight room is on the 21st floor and the patrons take the same elevators as guests. I found this a little off putting as I was in the elevator with about 10 unsavory characters. I would definitely recommend the Drake as it is probably the most affordable in the area and really doesn't skimp on amenities. I love Kimpton Hotels and stay at one anytime I have a chance. As with all Kimptons there is a free wine social everyday from 5-6 and they are very pet friendly. This was a wonderful stay and experience in SanFran.

(He was also adorable)\r\nThere are two bars, one downstairs and one on the 21st floor (the top floor). The bartender was great downstairs, and made a great chocolate martini. We didn't go in to the top bar because it was a $10 cover, and didn't tell us until we got to the front. Not sure if you don't pay a cover if you are staying there, and didn't ask. The bouncer was very pleasant, and also attractive. A $10 cover isn't much, we just didn't go because we wanted to talk and it was more of a night on the town vibe so we headed back downstairs.

The hotel is centrally located right in the middle of Union Square. Plenty of wonderful restaurants and shopping! It's near the metro, and also walking distance to a lot of San Francisco attractions. When we arrived the valet guy dressed in his renaissance outfit offered to park the car right away but did not mention the price of $59 a day. When I asked price I decided not to park there and half a block away I parked for $30 a day. We got checked in right away and when we got to our room it was the very last room on the corner the regular rooms are tiny! We had a rattling noise coming from the bathroom celling that was pretty loud so I called and told them it was going to be impossible for me to sleep there. They upgraded right away to a deluxe which was soo much better and a bigger space.

This is a heritage hotel so if you are expecting perfection, go elsewhere. I personally love the \"quirky\" of heritage properties, so go out of my way to find them.  The lobby bar is beautiful and I love the staircase entrance.That being said, I also appreciate, renovations that honor the era but are more than a fresh coat of lipstick.  First off, yes, I'd stay here again, the close proximity of transportation and walkability is great.\r\nso what didn't fit the bill? The new capet and wall paper looked OK but an old bathtub with new metal plug pulled away from the paint (and chipped) overshadows the newer carpet and drapes.  The second should be prefaced with thanks Sir Francis, you taught me for next time.  I booked a classic queen through Expedia, the reservation was confirmed and guaranteed for late arrival- all paid in advance.

Our room had 2 queen beds with a city view. It was well appointed, smoke and scent-free, very quietly nestled on the 15th floor.\r\nWe knew we were going to a historic building and adjusted our expectations accordingly. The bathroom is small compared with those found in newer hotels, but it was not as bad as what we read in some reviews.\r\nThe Starlight Room on the 21st floor is a definite plus, for its view and vintage ambience. The music was not bad either. It's not for the younger, 20s-30s crowd. As a couple in our mid-40s with young teen daughters who enjoy arts and cuisine, the restrained, friendly vibe was definitely to our liking. From bellhop to the red and gold-attired beefeaters, to reception staff - the level of hospitality is wonderful. La Scala Bistro is one elevator ride down. Its short but carefully crafted menu is an extension of the warmth of hotel service. For short stays, trade housekeeping (save water) for free drinks and other offers. For chocoholics and treats, we went to Tout Sweet Patisserie, known to locals for great pastries & espresso, located on the 3rd floor of Macy's (yes, the department store).\r\nDesigual and UniqClo are go-to for comfortable, quality clothes' shopping.

There needs to be a note saying that there is a free newspaper along with the free coffee as we purchased it every day across the street, not knowing that.  The idea of dispensing shampoo and other soaps is a great idea.  There needs to be more towel racks for the face and hand towels.  None in the bathroom within easy reach!  The light in the closet (in switch to turn on and off) so we couldn't see the combination to the safe.  Also, the hair dryer hook needs to be lowered.

The hotel room was beautiful decorated , but kind of small. We had two full beds and they took up a lot of space. The bathroom was smaller then I expected,but that was from the time they were made. The entertainment upstairs for Sunday is a Drag was very good and the food was really good for the brunch. We went to Scala for dinner our first night there, we thought it was a little dark. The food was excellent but a little more pricey then we were use to. The staff in the hotel from the people at the counter,to the handlers of our baggage were very accomodating, the people who cleaned our room did an excelllent job. I would like to say a special thank you to the conceirge, Leif. We wanted to see the Sunday is a Drag show , we ask him Saturday night about getting us some seats.

We opted this time for a larger room, and think that the extra cost was worth it. The facilities are fine, perhaps just a little on the old and close to tacky side. When we arrive in the early morning at hotels, we nearly always book the night before. We did not do that this time, since we arrived at 1.45 in the afternoon, only to be told that the official check-in time was 3 pm. The desk person was just a bit officious in the way he handled this, although we recognize that it is reasonably standard that hotels have a 3 pm book in time (we were not pleased after a 14 hour flight, however). In our time in San Francisco some years ago, the wonderful view in the afternoon from the Starlight Roof was a highlight, and it is too bad that it only opens now at 6 pm (although the layout seems improved on our stay a couple of years ago).

The staff were lovely; so friendly & kind. The rooms are (especially the bathrooms) quite small but we didn't mind because the rooms & hotel have so much character. The elevators never seemed too busy & the location was great. We called ahead to let the hotel know we were travelling with a small child as the Kimpton website offers a variety of child friendly services such as: \"baby proofing\" the room, providing a nightlight, & an adorable child's housecoat for the duration of your stay. We were assured these services would be provided to us but when we arrived none of these things had been done. I was disappointed; however I'm not going to condemn anyone over it as I never went to the front desk & complained, in which case I'm sure the very nice staff would have complied. We weren't too concerned though as there weren't a lot of exposed outlets or other safety hazards. We were also told when we phoned ahead that there would be a coffee pot in the room which there was not but there was a mini fridge! Room service food was awful, awful, awful; so gross & $50 for two non-extravagant breakfasts. But again – we never complained or tried to get our money back. Finally, I thought $57 a day was a bit pricey for parking, but I’m not familiar with S.F. valet parking costs so maybe it wasn’t unreasonable? All in all we still loved this hotel despite a few hiccups, would definitely return & recommend to friends & family.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"Loved the hotel's character and friendly/helpful staff!","negativeRemarks":"Gross & expensive room service food and pricey parking.","locationRemarks":"Great central location with front door access to the cable cars!","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Calgary, AB, Canada","reviewSubmissionTime":"2013-02-23T04:14:04Z","roomTypeId":491979,"userDisplayName":"Amanda","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"4","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_ca","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"15254","reviewId":"47228645","photos":[],"itinId":"153634779146","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"4105","userNickname":"Britt","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Mixed Feelings- GREAT DOORMEN!","reviewText":"This was our first trip to San Francisco.

We then had a cocktail at the bar in the lobby before going to our room. The bar staff was pleasant but upon arrival to our room we were broadsided by the stench of raw sewage. Nevertheless we called the front desk and they asked us to come down and they provided us with another room. I will say that I was expecting something nice due to our misfortune of that last room but the room was much smaller in size and if you are anything other than a ballerina I would not expect to take a nice shower in this room. The shower was “L” shaped, now you would expect this to be large enough but it was in fact two feet in depth and three feet in width. However there is another sixteen inch by sixteen inch area that completes the L shape, where they installed the body wash and shampoo dispenser. Now I am 6’5” and weight about 240 so rubbing walls wouldn’t have been an issue had I been in my own shower and I know how clean it is. Ah, that leads me to the toilet which is of the charm of the old world size which the toilet paper holder pokes you in the ribs and the door barely clears the front of the toilet. Total size of the bathroom (shower only) was 6’x5’ and this included the shower, toilet, and sink… I would suggest you stay far away from this establishment and look more toward the Westin or Hyatt which are much nicer hotels.

As an early 20th century hotel that has been extensively renovated, even the \"deluxe\" rooms are small by modern standards, which is okay as long as you're prepared for it. Amenities in the rooms such as free Internet and a charging station for your phone, tablet, etc. were nice.\n\nWe stayed with our infant and the room was pretty cramped for the three of us. The bathroom was *very* tiny and the floor space in the room once a crib was in there was pretty limited. The bed was not very comfortable and the foam pillows we requested #instead of the normal down pillows# were the worst of any hotel I've ever stayed in. The decor was nice but, when it comes right down to it, comfort trumps looks and this was definitely the weak point of the room.\n\nHowever, we did have a corner room on the 14th floor, though, which provided great views of San Francisco! The hotel restaurant, Scala's, was good and the lobby bar was very lively during the week and throughout the weekend.\n\nThe hotel's location is great for shopping and the famous San Fran cable cars run right up the street alongside the hotel, which provides easy transportation out to Fisherman's Wharf.\n\nOverall, the location was excellent, the service was very good, the rooms were okay.

The foyer, and Bar Drake area near reception are breathtaking. Rooms are on the small side, but that is to be expected with a building its age. The small bathrooms however are somewhat cumbersome both to move around in, as well as store your toiletries. There is next to no counter space, and three small shelves above the toilet. I would not let this be a deciding factor for someone not staying here, but it's merely a heads-up. Staff were very eager to help with anything required, but did not follow through on several small things. (Again, nothing major, probably mere slips of the memory, but I wouldn't expect such things to be forgotten in a hotel like this).

He disappeared the rest of the time and was eventually replaced by a new waiter who was equally as absent. Our glasses were often empty and we'd have to request refills. The food was good, but it took a long time (at least 25 minutes) from order to service at the table. The restaurant was not that full either, so I'm not sure if the staff treated us horribly on purpose or not. We did not go back to Scala's. Housekeeping never came to our room so we made our own beds. The only good experience was when we left our luggage with the doorman so we could shop a bit more.

All the hotels were crazy expensive due to a conference ($350 - $480 a night).\n\nI turned to Expedia and it showed me a four star hotel at Union Square, but didn't give me the name. I bought a week and it turned out to be the Sir Francis Drake. I was a little hesitant because I just came from a 1920s hotel that was badly ran.\n\nThe Drake was an amazing difference. It was super clean, and everyone there was very nice and super professional. The downs were a slow elevator and a small bathroom. The street outside was a little noisy, but it didn't prevent me from sleeping soundly.\n\nThe location can't be beat. I took a cable car home from Fisherman's wharf on the weekend and it took me right to my hotel step. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. I would go back for business or pleasure.\n\nThanks Drake! :)","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Columbus, Ohio","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-10-31T13:19:16Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"15254","reviewId":"20255234","photos":[],"itinId":"390019655","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great location at Union Square","reviewText":"I booked this hotel for its convenience to Union Square and was very happy with my choice.

Also, there are no safes in these rooms.\n\nWatch out for scam in lobby bar. On four occasions, despite bringing it to the barperson's attention each time, they tried to charge us 33% more on a bottle of wine compared to the drinks menu price. Also, they try and charge a gratuity (I thought they were voluntary) of 20% on parties of 5 or more in the lobby bar. When challenged they said it was in the menu. It isn't. They then said that it's in the restaurant menu and, because you can order in the lobby bar, that's why you have to pay. I challenged them and got a reluctant refund. I don't mind tipping generously for exceptional service but this is just a rip off.\n\nIf you don't need/want your room made up every day of your stay you can claim a $10 voucher, redeemable in the hotel bars/restaurant/nightclub.

Beautiful lobby bar. Rooms/bathrooms not huge, but fine. Skip maid service and they give you a $10 coupon for the restaurant breakfast, which is incredible.

It provided us with easy access to many venues around the city. Fisherman's Wharf, Alcatraz Cruises and Chinatown are all within minutes of the Sir Francis Drake. For those of you traveling with 4 or more here is a little secret: It is cheaper to take a taxi than the cable cars if you don't buy an all-day pass. Of course if you like to experience the cable cars, please do. It is a friendly way to see different parts of San Francisco served by the cable cars. Shopping at Macy's, Nordstrom, and Niketown is just a couple blocks away. There are many restaurants nearby to choose from. Also like the fact that there is a Starbucks attached to the hotel. Be sure to check out the tin ceilings inside many establishments. They are quite interesting to admire.........overall I enjoyed my stay at the Sir Francis Drake. Staff was responsive to our needs, room was clean and neat and location was great. Remember, this is an older hotel so don't expect the latest and greatest in electronic gadgetry. You are here to relax and vacation, not to be on the Internet all day and/or watch cable tv. Get out and enjoy the town and take notice how the town transforms from daytime hustle and bustle to nighttime entertainment . Be sure to enjoy the great restaurants that abound in and around the city.

I picked the Union Square location because when one travels light to SFO, it is extremely easy to take the BART into the city, and the Powell Street stop is just steps away from the hotel. That's a savings of over $40 each way on a taxi ride! And it only takes an extra 10 minutes to get to and from the airport by BART... As for the hotel itself, it is a grand, old hotel with rooms that have been nicely updated. I had a lovely corner room on a high floor with an incredible view on the bay. I had previously stayed at another hotel of that chain, the Palomar, and that room was simply wonderful. I was only disappointed in one thing in my room at the Sir Francis Drake: the size of the bathroom. That was perhaps the smallest bathroom I had ever been in, apart from those nasty little London hotels... There was nothing particularly wrong with the bathroom itself, apart from its size, really. But it made getting ready in the morning a much less pleasant experience than one would have wanted, as it was all about avoiding hitting a wall or the door! Apart from that one element, I had a very pleasant stay and would highly recommend this hotel.

We were able to get an excellent deal on Expedia.ca....and believe me, you get what you pay for. Although this hotel has an excellent location (one block off Union Square and close to all the best shopping SF has to offer), it is in serious need of updating. Whatever you do, do NOT upgrade your room to the higher floor with a queen size bed. These rooms are extremely small - smaller than ones I've seen in London or NYC. Also, the walls in the hotel are paper thin, so be prepared to hear everything going on next door, and I mean everything. The only redeeming quality of this place was the night manager's willingness to help us out immediately when we weren't satisfied with our tiny, run down room. He was incredibly polite and made every effort to ensure we were satisfied with the change. He even gave us coupons for a free breakfast at the restaurant in the hotel. In summary - if you really don't care about the room you're in, and you're ok with hearing all the traffic noise and your neighbors, the SFD Hotel is the place to stay.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Edmonton","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-06-24T14:25:46Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"15254","reviewId":"20255432","photos":[],"itinId":"274646461","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Gail","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Convenient, clean, comfortable","reviewText":"This hotel is very convenient to all services in San Francisco; the city center, the Museums, the Trolley, restaurants, China Town are all within walking distances.

It took another 15 minutes to find my luggage, then ended up taking my luggage to my room with a look from the staff when I didn't produce a tip. The room was not as I would expect. The television provided was not as pictured in their advertisements downstairs, cords hanging out from wall sockets and a bathroom that could barely fit one person.

The hotel's parking was too pricey for us, but less than 1.5 blocks away we found a parking garage for 70% less than what the hotel was charging, so I recommend driving around the neighborhood to find a better parking price.

It is steps from the Powell Street BART station, the cable cars and bus routes. It is also right at Union Square and surrounded by great shops and restaurants. The rooms are small, but keep in mind it is a major metropolitan city, and the rooms are usually small to accomodate all the people staying. While small, they were not uncomfortable in any way and were kept very clean. The only downfalls we experienced were small inconveniences from poor service. Hotels that master the art of \"the little things\" are always the best. This hotel is still working on mastering \"the little things.\" For instance, we had three people in the rooms and were there for 5 nights. On only one occassion were there three sets of towels. We had to call every time and they would bring giant stacks of towels. Unnecessary. They would also take the drinking glasses and not replace them. And we also received a bit of condescention when we left our boarding pass information they promised to book as the flight opened to get the A passes. We called 20 minutes to remind and it had not been done and we ended up getting stuck in a different boarding group. While some of the service issues were frustrating, it all comes out in the wash with a charming hotel with great period details and a perfect location and reasonable price.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Baltimore, MD","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-07-11T12:39:54Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"15254","reviewId":"20255554","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"ginny","brandType":"Expedia","title":"I would stayu at hotel again.","reviewText":"This hotel is in a great location if you like upscale shopping, designer didgs and goood eats.

Beautiful architecture in the lobby (though this might be under renovation in early 07) and the door men were a hoot. Fabulous access to the Powell Street cable car (get a daily or multi-day passport to save $) and request a quiet room to avoid hearing those \"ding-dings\" until 1am when the cable cars shut down. No need for a car at this location. If you do bring one, be prepared to pay dearly to valet it. The Sir Francis Drake caters to an adult crowd of any age, but I wouldn't recommend the hotel for young partiers or families with very small children. The only real drawback was the nightclub on the 21st floor and the swarms of people trying to get in. Take the lower level elevator and show your room key to bypass security and crowds, and you might want to reserve a lower floor (no sound problems on the 15th floor for us.) Overall, we were very satisfied and would stay there again. Note: If you aren't coming to the city for \"the San Francisco\" experience (think: history, architecture, crowds, noise, small rooms), or if you need state-of-the art conveniences and business services, then stay in a newer chain hotel. But, as boutique hotels go, the Sir Francis Drake was definitely better quality. (I prefer it for location and comfort over the Maxwell, for instance.) Check out the other Kimpton Hotels in the area too, as some have wild lobby decor worth a walk by.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Colorado","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-01-03T16:45:18Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"15254","reviewId":"20255769","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Theresa","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Good location, just ok hotel","reviewText":"The location right in union square is just fabulous and very convenient.

On the street level and in its rooftop bar, it still has its SF magic. But, once you enter the hotel and the guest room floors, you notice that its grandeur is only superficial. The lobby is rather dreary, energized only by the youthful staff; yet even they aren't able to imbue the place with more than a smile. The residence floors are rather shabby and the rooms pretty small. My room wasn't picked up as late as 7:00 p.m. the day after my arrival; indeed, it wasn't until I called to inquire that they promptly dispatched someone to make my bed. Having lived in SF for a number of years, I have always enjoyed SFD's proximity to Union Square and Nob Hill, its colorful beefeater doormen, and its two first class ground level restaurants, Scala and Cafe Espresso. I've also drank and danced away the night in Harry Denton's rooftop ballroom. Yet, I'd never really ventured into the hotel, as hotel.

Right on chinatown and close to several great little restaurants that the City is famous for. The hotel building is very regal. Although classic is not my style, I enjoyed the historic/heritage architecture.\r\n\r\nThe hotel staff was very very nice. They went out of their way to make it a memorable stay for us (we were celebrating hubby's landmark birthday). We were given a really nice room. Everyone whom we bumped into, had a warm smile and they were genuinely interested in helping!! (I mean the staff, not the guests. Quite a few guests were very uppity. Heard in the elevator: \"xxx says he is a <insert a 4-star hotel chain name> type guy. Donno how he does it?!!\")\r\n\r\nThe room decor is very modern, classy, muted. Very relaxing. Bathroom is exquisite. The double vanity, the crystal knobs, the marble, the trims and moldings - everything is really nice. It was also a spotlessly clean room.\r\n\r\nWhat left something to be desired, was the quality of fixtures. The toilet in the lobby area would not flush properly even after trying multiple times. In the room, the shower could only be so hot. It was still comfortable, so did not have to deal with cold water, but could have dispensed hotter temperature water.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, if you end up thinking in a 5-star hotel \"my home xxx (shower/toilet/whatever) works better than this\" -- then it is a bit of a bummer, isn't it?

A friend who lives in the city gave us some feedback about our initial choice of hotels; namely, that it was going to be a disaster. Taking her cue, a few days before our arrival I booked two nights at the Ritz on their club floor knowing full well the cost but deciding that my wife and I needed and wanted a memorable hotel experience. To be brief : our stay at the Ritz-Carlton in SF was extraordinary. In every way the hotel was more than we could have wished. We opted for the Club booking because once before, in NYC, we had gifted ourselves a Club stay and this time, it was better than that. The staff is unbelievably attentive, going out of their way to pamper their guests, the bed superb for sleeping and everything just as you'd like it. And, and this is a major factor, the refreshments provided on the Club floor (at every meal plus evening desserts and drinks) were just flat out fabulous. Not being particularly interested in running around the city after a day of sightseeing (we could be faulted for that, but we had been all over the place in Sonoma), having our own gourmet pantry was the height of luxury, if not decadence. If you can do it, don't deprive yourself of such pleasure.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Near Philadelphia","reviewSubmissionTime":"2013-09-26T12:06:27Z","roomTypeId":12334,"userDisplayName":"Steve","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":2,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":2,"hotelId":"22148","reviewId":"57922056","photos":[],"itinId":"156127384465","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Nice hotel, very expensive----600/ night","reviewText":"Everything was ok except room was too hot....called front desk, they sent repairman, still too hot","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"Friendly staff","negativeRemarks":"Temperature in room","locationRemarks":"China town,restaurants","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2013-09-17T00:44:52Z","roomTypeId":200018399,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":2,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":2,"hotelId":"22148","reviewId":"57534657","photos":[],"itinId":"162363543290","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Andrew","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Don't waste your money.","reviewText":"When you stay at a Ritz and spend $500 a night for a room you expect an exceptional experience.

Many people were impressed that everyone seems to know their name. That's because many staff members wear an wireless headset, like in Banana Republic, so when you arrive and the doorman asks your name, he alerts others. I've stayed at another Ritz-Carlton and the one downside is the inconsistency of their staff. They tend to be young and energetic but can be forgetful and not as polished as they should be. For instance, guest services didn't follow through on a couple of small requests and the one doorman got into a shouting match with a cabby over who had \"next.\" One of the three days we were there, housekeeping failed to restock the coffee bar and I noticed they never removed the hair that had collected in the drain. Also, the water pressure for the shower was sub-par and the showerhead had been re-attached to the tile wall in a shoddy manner.

We're both vegetarian and special notice was taken of this, no questions asked. We also did pay for one meal in the hotel - the Vegetarian 'Taster' Menu in the Dining Room restaurant. This was the best meal I have EVER had in my life, and the service and wine (I chose a mid-priced bottle of Napa Merlot from the very copious list) were superb. It's not cheap, but well worth it as one of life's major food experiences. The hotel is ideally located just a few blocks from Union Square and the main shopping area, with a nice downhill walk through Chinatown in the other direction to Fisherman's Wharf. The hotel is also right by the California Street cable car route should you need assistance back up the hill! The room was comfortably furnished without being gross or too 'bling'.

Anyone that thinks customer service died in the 20th century hasn't stayed at the Ritz-Carlton. It is each of the staff member's personal goal to make sure you have everything you! We stayed on the Club level and it was money well spent. The food in the Club Lounge was perfect. The spa and pool area was like a peaceful retreat to the mostly noisy and bustling city around the hotel. Filled with scented candles and soft music, you really get the full relaxation you need while down there. The rooms were nicely decorated and the bed and bedding were so soft. Luxurious bathrobes and slippers were ready for us each day and they even had small sizes for the kids! Even the roll-away bed we ordered was soft and comfortable. As for the location, it was close to just about everything. And any place that was further than walking distance we just hopped in one of the \"House Cars\" and got whisked away in luxury to any place we wanted around the city. My wife and I really enjoyed being driven to dinner in a brand new Mercedes-Benz S550 and when we were done a quick call to the Hotel and we were being picked up right outside the restaurant. Talk about VIP service! Being S.F., if you do decide to walk to your destination, be prepared to walk up and down some steep hills.

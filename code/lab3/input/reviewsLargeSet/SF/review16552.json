I know I'm probably describing the entire bay area (and Seattle), but it's impossible not to see political correctness run amuck in the form of rainbow flags, Obama bumper stickers, and tofu-eating people in spandex. These are the same people that criticize those \"rich Republicans\" while they themselves live in these ridiculously expensive homes and drive their Prius vehicles. I guess they think they justify their obvious hypocrisy because they bring their own bags when they shop and they adopt babies from other countries instead of adopting American children that need parents here at home.

You definitely would need to have a car to stay outside the city, but to us it was not worth paying an extra $30+/day for our car to stay in the city. We had planned to go to Muir Woods, the Marin Headlands and to Sonoma so we thought this area would be a great central location. Mill Valley is just north of the Golden Gate bridge and a mile or so from Sausilito. We ate in Sausilito twice because it was so easy to access and the food was awesome. The free breakfast at the hotel was fabulous every morning - anything you would need to get your day started. They keep the place immaculate - always super clean. The bike/walking trail around the hotel was a nice change of pace after running up & down the streets of SF. They have a nice pool & hot tub. We took advantage of the hot tub one night after a long day hiking. We are sticklers on how comfortable a mattress feels at a hotel! This bed did not disappoint. We split our stay for the week with the Holiday Inn & a place in wine country. Wish we would have stayed the entire week at the HI Exp and just drove to wine country for the day.

We only live an hour away but wanted something close to San Francisco where we were having dinner without paying the obnoxious prices for a nice San Francisco hotel. We stayed in this hotel a few years ago when it was under different ownership and really enjoyed it then. Luckily, it hasn't changed much. The rooms are still clean, updated, and comfortable. The king bed was really comfortable, and the bathroom amenities were nice (Bath & Body Works). There is a large flat screen TV in the room with HD channels. It's a huge pet peeve of mine when hotels have large flat screen TVs with a standard definition feed, so that was good.\n\nThe included breakfast was pretty good. You get the standard fare (cereal, bagels, juice), as well as a good selection of hot foods (eggs, sausage, hot cinnamon rolls, pancake maker). We saw that they offer free smores around dinner time, but we didn't have the opportunity to try as we were out for dinner.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a clean and comfortable hotel without paying sky-high hotel prices in San Francisco for a comparable level of comfort, I would highly recommend this place. It's also got some nice views of water from the hotel grounds. Note that if your room is facing northeast, you're probably going to be looking at the underside of Highway 101.

There was no specified dog walk area (i.e. La Quinta). Because the reservation from Expedia did not mention the dogs, I think the clerk was ready to turn us away, but the room was already paid for. So she had no choice but to take us and I had no choice but to stay since the reservation was non-refundable. Fortunately, it was only one night.

San Francisco is less than 1/2-hour away, either by car or by scenic ferry ride from nearby Sausalito. Well-stocked grocery stores are nearby if you need them. With a little more time, we could have walked the nearby trails -- or biked them. I'm sure this would have been pleasant.

The hotel facility itself has been refurbished, with added amenities like a heated tile floor in the bathroom; good shower, pleasant room accessories, and comfortable beds, etc. Your hotel fee includes a continental breakfast every morning from 6:30 to 9 AM---in a rather crowded little dining area, but the selections are serviceable, if not great. The one real downside is that the audibility of upstairs guests is greater than one would like, just because it is a fairly old building. There are good workout facilities, an indoor pool, and an outdoor fire pit.

The s'mores and outside fire pit are great. We did not use them, but it is a cool feature to have bikes to borrow. My only complaint would be some of the staff. I found a couple of them to be less than friendly. We also received a phone call from the front desk at 9:00 pm asking us to be quiet. We did not understand, since we were all in bed watching the Olympics. That night, and others, we could hear other people talking, being loud, and slamming doors. So maybe they need to add some sound proofing, or improve on making sure they get the right people when things get loud.

It takes more than 2 hours, but the staff is OK with it, because there are not many others, who wants to ride at night.\nThe third trail is to Tuburon.

The continental breakfast was decent: oatmeal, cereal, different types of breads, tea, coffee, fruit, etc. All was decent. The cost is a bit for the size of the rooms. Recommend this hotel for a one night stay. I would not recommend for a long week vacation.

I originally booked my room at a much higher rate (on the hotel's website) but as the date of arrival grew closer, I found a non-refundable rate at more almost $50.00 less per night on Expedia. My review is based on that lower rate. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast was very good. Fresh, lots of variety and served in a lovely eating area. The room itself, while in very good repair and with a large screen tv and refridgerator, was very small. Hallways looked oldish and had a bit of a strange smell. The town of Mill Valley had almost no restaurant choices (although there is a restaurant attached to the hotel itself). Sausalito is just up street a few minutes and offered many more restaruant choices. Traffic in Mill Valley was more difficult to navigate than in San Francisco as this area is now too populated for the existing roads. Turns (both right and left) out of the hotel or other Mill Valley businesses were sometimes very difficult due to the constant stream of traffic. Assertive driving skills were a must! Again, I was satisfied for the most part and would stay at this property when I am in the area again.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Michigan","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-05-17T13:29:46Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"16552","reviewId":"18715823","photos":[],"itinId":"353209703","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"mike","brandType":"Expedia","title":"excellent","reviewText":"location great...easy to use for Marin, easy access to SF or East bay...\nroom great, staff great...good continetal breakfast...quiet, great view of Mt.

I had read somewhere that the hotel had been renovated, and it looks it, as everything was new and the decor was sort of like relaxed Pottery Barn. I did not have a car during this stay, so at first I was upset upon arriving at the Marin Airporter stop on Manzanita Avenue of possibly being stranded and not knowing how to get around, but I was happy to learn that Sausalito was a short taxi drive away, as was the Ferry if you want to go into the city. Since my primary reason for this stay was relaxation and hitting some of the local nature sites, my mission was accomplished. The hotel is literally across the street from the Richardson Bay sanctuary, so it's a beautiful walk in the morning or afternoon, with Mt. Tam in the distance and the hills surrounding you. Muir Woods is also not far off, although I did not have time to go there. The breakfast was generous and staff was immensely helpful, thank you so much Robert, Helen, and another young lady whose name I did not get, who helped me get a taxi and answer my questions. It was so refreshing to experience such friendliness, even a kind stranger drove me down Shoreline Highway to the hotel a few hundred yards away, as I was walking back from Sausalito in the rain and getting quite drenched! The rain was not a downer - it resulted in the most beautiful rainbow over the bay!

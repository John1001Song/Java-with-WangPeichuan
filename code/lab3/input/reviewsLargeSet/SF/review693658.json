It's also not so close to the major Market Street where you get all the traffic sound and craziness of the street.  Chinatown is also about 15 minutes leisurely walk.  Part of the hotel is facing the freeway.  Make sure to ask for a room on the other side of the building.  Also ask for a room AWAY from the elevator.  You definitely can hear the people chatting loudly in and out of the elevator.  WiFi is fast here.  Unfortunately, this hotel is located in the more pricer part of town, so you won't get much of mom-and-pop type of restaruants nearby.  Only 24hr. Subway a block way, but a lot of homeless people squat there late at night.

Waiting staff is very friendly. The breakfast package with room was a good option.\n\nPool (3ft deep) and spa were clean and are in a room on the 2nd floor that has windows to inside patio and gym.

Instead, we had to walk over a mile each direction before and after the race. Room was very tight. With the sofa bed pulled out, we barely had room to walk around the king bed. Our room was expensive and on top of it we had to pay $51.00 dollars for parking. We asked about less expensive parking and were directed to another lot on the corner. We were told they charged $25.00 per day. Well, they didn't. It was $45.00 a day. So, we ended up parking at the hotel. On top of it, marathon events began at 5:30 in the morning on Saturday and the Starbucks in the hotel didn't open until 7:00. It would have been nice for the Starbucks to have been open earlier for family members. Again, it would have been nice for the hotel to have had some things more readily available for the marathon weekend.

Perhaps it's my fault but Marriott did not offer one in our room. Unfortunately I have become used to finding this amenity in virtually all rooms I have stayed in over the years at considerably less expense. Our luggage took over an hour to arrive in our room and we wanted to get out more quickly. They said that our names weren't on the luggage. Unfortuantely the overagressive folks asking if we wanted help with the luggage mentioned not a thing about this detail. I am accustomed to checking in first but the street setup here makes that difficult if not impossible. But this was the staff's error not mine. We were told we'd be provided a complimentary USA Today newspaper- but we received none. The breakfast is from 6 to 9:30. I know that everyone is cutting back expenses but that's a bit early for some of us who regard staying at a hotel as signifying a time one might sleep in. We had a King bed and a sofa bed. The sofa bed was disappointing to put it mildly. The staff also did not seem that adept at offering helpful advice- this seemed odd for a major hotel in downtown San Francisco. We were there to see a San Francisico Giants game and for this the location was great. Along with the fact that the room, facility was clean that's about all the praise I can give the Marriott Courtyard. I doubt I will ever stay there again.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Santa Cruz, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-06-13T14:32:33Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"693658","reviewId":"17782281","photos":[],"itinId":"364921036","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Mike","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Comfortable Accommodations in a Beautiful City","reviewText":"Close to Moscone Center, terrific restaurants and bars.

When we pulled into the check in area there were two employees ready to unload our vehicle and check our car as we chose the valet parking. When we asked for extra towels and washclothes they were courteous and prompt about getting them for us. The hotel is one of few downtown that has an indoor pool and hot tub. The lobby is spacious and comfortable to meet up with people or wait for your vehicle. The room was also spacious, clean and comfortable. The only negative about the room was that there was not a refrigerator so we had to use ice in our cooler pak and drain it each day. Although we were hesitant to pay for the valet parking it was worth having our car to explore areas outside of SF and they were prompt about bringing our car to us. The hotel cleans the bedding after every guest which was comforting to me after reading reviews of other hotels. We appreciated having a Starbucks in the hotel but they are not open in the evening. We ate at the restaurant at the hotel one night. It has a limited menu but the food was good. We were able to walk everywhere in the downtown SF area. We walked to the Wharf, Union square, Coit tower, china town and the dock to take the ferry to Alcatraz.

The Courtyard \"Dowtown\" sports a decent bar and restaurant area with an internal Starbucks soon to open. The lobby is set off with an atractive lounge equipped with fireplace that was used to host a high school reunion on the Friday we stayed at the hotel. The reunion proved to highlight the only drawback of the hotel. If somebody's partying in the middle of the night, you will hear each and every hallway conversation through your room door.

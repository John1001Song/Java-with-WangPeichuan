I checked the valve under the sink and it was open.  So it's off somewhere else upstream.  The top of the pop-up drain plug was broken off/missing.  So it was impossible to fill up the sink.  I guess even if it wasn't broken, it would have been difficult to fill up the sink, anyway, because the attachment point for the pop-up was missing.  The sink is a pedestal sink, so there is no counter.  There is no toilet paper holder.  The toilet paper sits in a basket on top of the toilet.  No biggie, except that I had to keep removing the top of the toilet to figure out why it wouldn't flush.  The shower is 28\" x 30\".  Compare that to an old fashioned shower that is 36\" x 36\".

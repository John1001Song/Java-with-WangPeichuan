My colleague and I were both booked in rooms with 2 full-size beds (that's all that was available at the time of booking) but we were both pleasantly surprised that the front desk staff were excited to give us each a room with king beds instead.  Upon reaching my room, I found it to be clean and acceptable.  Nothing too fancy, but I wasn't going to be doing much more than sleeping in it, so it met my needs. Checkout was fast and easy and again the front desk staff were more than eager to meet our needs.\r\n\r\nFirst would have to be the fact that the door to room 535 is hung so poorly that I could actually see out of the gap between it and the frame out into the parking lot!  I had to prop the ironing board against the door so that it covered the gap.  Second would be the very poor soundproofing between the room and the outside.  Granted, the gap in the door probably attributed to some of this problem, but until I cranked up the AC to create some white noise, people yelling outside and the loud buses made for a noisy evening.

Parking is free but finding it can be a challenge. It seems there are more rooms than spots. What complicated the matters worse are tour buses. They have no where to park so they either take up multiple spots or block you in. I was late for my convention because a bus driver could not make a turn in the parking lot, left his bus unattended for 20-30 minutes and had to get a guest up at 7:30 am to move her car so he can pass. Very infuriating. I wasn't the only one blocked in. \r\n\r\nThe room. Seemed clean. Bathtub and sink we're not well cleaned, I found crumbs and chips under one of the beds.

It was after she checked on the computer that there was an error was when she said, \"Sorry about that.\"\nOnce we got to our new room, we found dirty, wet washcloths on the bathroom toilet. There was also no remote. We called down to the lobby and someone retrieved the dirty washcloths and brought us a remote.

Also, if you don't like noise, this is not the place for you, it is very noisy, from the nearby airport, highway and people talking loudly walking by your room, since it is an outside entry hotel. But it is still a good value for the money compared to other places in the same area. I love the fact they are pet-friendly and don't charge for your pets! I got the superior king room which had a microwave and fridge, and a safe for my belongings which was nice. There is a nice path to take a walk on towards the rear of the hotel, and a 24/7 on site restaurant, it seems like a little dive, but the food is really good, and the staff always friendly. There are no coffee makers in the rooms, but there is coffee 24/7 in the lobby free for guests. I also like the room's L shaped work station. If only the wi-fi was working better I could have stayed longer and got my work done! I liked this place enough to book another stay with them a week later, and had a few problems with things not working in the room, I told them upon check out, and they discounted me for the inconvenience.Pool is closed during winter, and there is no hot tub, but all the rooms have bathtubs which is nice.Overall, worth the price, and it seems to be in a safe area.

At that hour (and after a 4.5 hour flight), we decided to try it, and when the room was found to be a little musty, but not smoky, we kept it. On-site restaurant was good--if a bit pricey for a diner-type restaurant. No other dining choices--except hotel restaurants--are in walking distance. There is a great free trolley/shuttle into the town of Burlingame that run every hour to a great variety of restaurants and shops. Hotel shuttle runs to the airport (connection point to BART train to downtown San Francisco) reliably every 20 minutes. The lobby coffee machines are a nice touch, making hot chocolate, coffee and lattees.

When we finally arrived, the desk clerk was grumping on the phone to a guest saying, \"Try using a little common sense.\" However, he was professional enough toward me, although not overly friendly. The room had only 2 towels for 4 person occupancy, but in the morning, a friendly lady promptly brought more towels when asked to do so. The room was clean, and everything in working order. Parking was easy. I was looking forward to the promised cappucino in the morning, but it was all gone (the ad on Expedia said it was available all the time). We took the shuttle to the airport, which was convenient and reliable. Now that I know where-in-the-dickens it is located, I would stay again as long as the price were equal to or less than what I paid.

We went into the hotel room turn on the TV but there were no available channels so I went to call the front desk but the phone did not work. I then used my cell phone and contacted the front desk, I told her that the TV and the in-room phone was not working.  She repeated what I said and told me that she would send someone to check it out. One hour later and no one still has shown up. I called back and she sais again the she would send somebody.

Clean-ish room (the carpet was clean, the room smelled fine even to my sensitive sniffer).\r\n\r\nThe Bad: Some glaring maintenance issues like a bathroom pocket door that was off its rail (we fixed it), and plug ins that pushed into the wall when you plugged something in. Abysmal water pressure. Shower door is glass and has some issues with the roller/slider mechanics that makes the door extremely difficult to open and close. \r\n\r\nThe Ugly: Shower tile is in horrible condition. Lots of rips in wallpaper, stains on flooring. The shower stall is huge, but there's only one tiny soap bar holder for your shower toiletries. \r\n\r\nThe final straw that moved this from a 3 star review to a 2 star is an issue with the front desk. Check-in was fine, the woman working the desk was efficient and friendly. Unfortunately on our last night we had an issue with our room key and the evening desk clerk ridiculously accused us of not properly documenting the second person in the room (I booked as 1 bed/2 adults, which is exactly what we had). She refused to give us a new card due to this \"problem\" until I demanded to see whatever rule she thought we'd broken (she couldn't provide it), and finally my insistence that she call the manager.

We got to the hotel around 9pm and the lobby was full of people complaining. Should have left then but how bad could it be for a few hours. WRONG IT WAS HORRIBLE. After getting our key and heading to building 4 parking lot, there was a man in a old van just sitting there staring at us as we got our luggage out. Walking up to the second floor there were cigarette buds everywhere. Got to our room and opened the door and were over powered by the smell. OK, Lets check it out and see if we can just get through a few hours. The bathroom had wallpaper coming off the walls, the drain was not attached to the tiling but the toilet was new and the towels looked clean. The sink area was old but clean. The main area was SCARY. The furniture looked like it was dragged off the streets. The chair at the door was broken, the fabric on the couch reeked and was black with dirt. I pulled back the sheets and to check for bed bugs. TV was not fuzzy. The worst was NO AIR NO HEAT. Call the front desk and we waited until they send someone up about 10:30pm. The guy said it was not working. He then said he had to check the breaker. About 20 minutes later someone called to say it was not the breaker and asked if we wanted to change to a smaller no amenity room. We said no and left to slept in the airport. Asked for a refund got none as of yet, guy was too busy with other complaints.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":1,"ratingHotelCondition":1,"ratingService":1,"ratingRoomComfort":1,"positiveRemarks":"Nothing","negativeRemarks":"Tear it down and rebuild.","locationRemarks":"Noisy with road and plane traffic.

However I would say that the room could've been in better shape. Also, I tried repeatedly to contact the hotel by phone, but wasn't successful. The hotel as a whole deserves the rating it gets but it also provides the service and function you are looking for if you are looking at this level of accommodations. My only true gripe is that I did not get the type of room I requested, two queens as opposed to the king bed, but I doubt that would've made a significant difference in my experience. The real issue, and perhaps warning sign, is that on checkin they assumed I had reserved the queens. It also surprised me that they have smoking rooms. \r\nAside from the fact that we had to walk across the property to our room and it was raining and there is little shelter between the lobby and the last building on the property, I have little to truly complain about. It is a cheap accommodation close to the airport and with easy access to the city by car, however that is the key, you will want a car. It is also close to South San Francisco where dinning options are available. \r\nSo, if you're looking for cheap and at most a place to sleep between outings then at a price below $100 a night you really can consider the Travelodge","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":1,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"k","userLocation":"honolulu ","reviewSubmissionTime":"2015-04-29T03:04:36Z","roomTypeId":54104,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"16955","reviewId":"553f9f25e4b0e8c53dd4a963","photos":[],"itinId":"1103904042517","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"MMA","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"vader","brandType":"Expedia","title":"A little old but great price.

I told them I never cancelled it and if bad weather was the case how is that even possible when I called them February 8th, 2015 and wasn't checking in until 3 days later Feb 11th!!! How could they even know what the weather was in 3 days? It was beautiful outside! Anyway they reinstated my booking by the way which I paid for back in September already yet I found it funny if they cancelled my reservation why was my money never refunded to my credit card? I would never go here again or recommend this place to anyone. Stay elsewhere or sleep in your car you will be glad you did.

First be aware that the shuttle from the airport to the hotel stops running at 12:30am. So if your flight is late, you will need to spend about $15 for a cab to the Travelodge. Overall, this Travelodge is disappointing at best. Naturally, the hotel is close to the airport and you will be under flying jets; the windows in the room are old and do not block out sound effectively. In my room there was some cardboard stuck in the window lock to ensure it would lock tightly. The 200 rooms are scattered over about seven separate small spreadout structures. If you arrive on foot, you will need to walk and carry your luggage from the lobby to your room. There is no golf cart to take you and it could be a 5-10 minute walk, depending how fast you walk. The rooms are old and the walls and bathtubs show it.The electrical system seems to be also old with few AC plugs loaded with AC splitters. The rooms come with an ok fridge and an iron with an ironing board but be careful as I ironed a garment and it was ruined by the deposits in the iron. The hotel breakfast is very basic with only basic cereal, tea coffe, a few packaged danishes and some oranges and apples. No chees or yogurt is available. The staff you see is basically at the check-in and check-out process. They do their processing in/out job and that's it, not much more.

I thought the bed was comfortable and I did not find anything dirty or questionable about the bedding.\nI had no problems with the staff, they were all friendly and willing to give information.\nThere was a free continental breakfast. Nothing special. Fruit, toast, coffee and hot water for tea and a few prepackaged pastries.\nI actually went to the IHOP that is also attached and was happy.\n\nThe hotel is in a busy area but I didn't feel unsafe at any time (single female traveling alone)\n\nIn a nutshell:\nEasy to find shuttle to and from airport\nPool (I didn't use but looked decent enough)\ndated but clean rooms\nIHOP attached","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"close to hotel, free shuttle","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2013-03-10T22:31:18Z","roomTypeId":54104,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"hotelId":"16955","reviewId":"48067101","photos":[],"itinId":"154941218138","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"not so bad","reviewText":"hotel had an odor but having the door opened helped ..

No. But you have to be a real motel snob to think that, for the money, this isn't a great deal a hop away from San Francisco.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-09-16T22:21:26Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"16955","reviewId":"17937510","photos":[],"itinId":"337156311","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":1,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Dan","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Old, dirty, broken internet, don't stay here","reviewText":"ice cold pool, no internet, high prices, dirty rooms, mattress have springs sticking out, do not stay here","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":1,"ratingHotelCondition":1,"ratingService":1,"ratingRoomComfort":1,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Tacoma, WA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-09-15T20:07:30Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Val 1955","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"16955","reviewId":"17937696","photos":[],"itinId":"337858056","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":2,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Louise","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Noisy & run-down","reviewText":"Was flying out of SFO in the early morning so picked this hotel due to cost & location.

All the hotels we stayed in were very nice with plenty of space and nice facilities. Because of our previous experience, I didn't bother checking the review of Travelodge before I booked it. This turned out to be a huge mistake. After we checked in, we got a room on the ground floor. The first thing we noticed after entered the room was a strong smell of dampness. The room was typical of American motels and spacious enough. The carpet looked dirty. My son was trying to use the bathroom. As soon as he flushed the toilet, it was blocked and the water failed to stop and started flowing everywhere. I immediately called reception. The lady said that the keeper was helping to fix the toilet for another guest. We asked to change the room. The second room didn't look much better and was even worse in smell. I figured now that all the rooms were probably the same. The next morning as I was at the reception, there were two guests complaining to the receptionist, one lady said the shower was leaking, and a man said the toilet was not working.

We wanted a cheap place to stay while we saw the sights and met up with some friends in the city. The hotel itself had the standard amenities of a typical hotel room: bars of soap, towels, kleenex, shampoo + conditioner, coffee + tea and a coffee maker. The room also had an iron and an ironing board, desk, lamps, tv--as I said, it had the standard amenities.\n\nThe location was conveniently close to the airport and the freeway which made travel easy. However, the room itself had really uncomfortable beds (firm). We went on a rainy weekend and the heater did work but it took a bit of time to kick in. There were also a lot of sketchy areas in the room where they had tried to patch holes in the wall and cover them up with more wallpaper and tape. It was unsettling. There were also marks in the carpet where a previous guest had dropped the iron in a few places.\n\nOverall my sister was completely dissatisfied with the quality of our room. However, it was the cheapest thing we could find by Daly City. Considering that it was cheap, I'd say we got a good value. Our room was even in the back where not as many people stayed, so I felt like we had enough privacy. The only thing I was truly discontented by was the uncomfortable and firm beds.

The beds did not have fitted sheets, so if you turned while sleeping, the sheet under you would scrunch up and by morning, everything under you was pulled away from the sides, so the mattress itself was exposed. I did not sleep and I was very tired. The bathroom had some kind of small leak on the floor near the baseboard.

I'm glad it was nice weather, as walking back and forth would not have been good in the rain. Having a car would have been better. The only problem that occurred with my reservation is that I reserved a non-smoking king room, but they didn't have that when I checked in. They gave me a non-smoking room with two doubles instead. The room itself was tidy and clean, and had a all I needed. The room itself, along with the hotel, is not aging well. The carpets were rather worn, the bathtub had rusted through, patched and started to wear through again, and other signs of wear. The place looked tired and is in need of a facelift, and Travelodge should invest in this location to improve upon its site and reputation. Lastly, the shuttle is one that is shared between five other hotels in the area. While that is a good business practice, make sure to give ample time to get to the airport as the first run of the shuttle at 4:05 AM was a bit late. Overall it was fine, and I might stay there again if I need to get an early flight out of SFO, as this was the least expensive place in the area.

The staff suggested we use our laptop in the lobby, which was closer to the router. It is a \"freeway hotel\" (there are a lot in that area), so there may be some traffic noise, but we didn't notice any since we had a room on the far side of the hotel. They offered a room change when we requested our shower drain be unclogged; we declined, and they fixed the drain the same day we requested it. Overall, it's what I would expect for the price: clean, decent staff, etc. Let's be honest, you won't get a mint on your pillow or your suit brushed down, but you won't get bed-bugs after staying here either.

First surprise was, the free breakfast was actually a complimentary one for ONE person a day (worth approx. 6 Dollar) and hesitantly given to us upon asking. Second surprise was the room or better to say the way it smelled. Considering the Hotel is standing since the 60's the smell is probably coming from the very old (and loud) a/c system and/or mildew (Carpet, Walls...). The cleanliness was lacking too, the carpet was very dirty, there were stains and i wouldn't recommend to walk barefoot. A small tv was provided however the reception was despite cabel service rather foggy.

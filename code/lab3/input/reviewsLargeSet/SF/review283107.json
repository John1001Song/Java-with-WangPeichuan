Up sides - a clean, comfortable and very spacious room with air con that was very effective (I put it down to a very low temperature, then got cold so turned it up a bit). I asked for a quiet room and was put on the away-from road side of the building. Occasionally heard noise from the hall but pretty rare and not at a level that was a problem. Staff were friendly though mostly I didn't interact with them as there were no problems. I enjoyed making waffles in the machine for breakfast (they also had toast, bagels, cereal, yogurt, fruit juices, tea and coffee). They stored my luggage for the day after checking out as my flight was in the evening. Down sides - the air conditioning was quite loud while active (though it didn't actually bother me, I just noticed it), the breakfast room is very small for the hotel size, and at times there was a queue and not enough tables. The BART is about a 20-25 minute walk away ... which seemed like nothing in the morning, but on the way back in the evening felt quite far!!

Only one minor negative -When we checked in there was a smell, but it was like it was a smell from a cleaner, and we did not notice it again after about 30 seconds. The room was very clean, up to date, and the bed was as comfortable as any bed that I have slept on away from my home. There were several eating places within an easy walking distance. The hotel staff were very helpful. The manager even recommended a motel close to Fisherman's Wharf for our extended stay that we had planned after returning from Japan.

There is a broken power outlet on the wall and all wires exposed. The sink is leaking. The dryer is broken and never works.\n\nSecond, the room is dirty. I took off my shoes and walked on the carpet. Two minutes later, I can clearly see my turn dark. I doubted if the house keeper even vacuumed the room after the previous guest left.\n\nThirdly, this hotel provides free internet connection. But the signal is very weak and unstable. During two days, i only had about 30 mins to use internet.\n\nFourth, the front desk staff was not helpful. When I asked for help regarding the internet connection problem, she said she could not do anything because no other people complained this.\n\nFifth, the parking lot is EXTREMELY small and tight. It might take you 10-15 mins to park your car in an appropriate position. Also, you will find problem in open your door as another car was just half feet away besides your car.\n\nFinally, the breakfast is insufficient. Although it is available from 6-9am. But normally, there is nothing left around 8:40am. I went there two mornings at 8:40am, and found out that only juice left. The front desk staff did not add any new items. The breakfast desk is besides the front desk. There are very limited items.

After adding tax and gratuity it is $42 a person. I was also surprised that there was not a list of hotel amenities in the room.

The room was not ready, so they gave my wife a $50 certificate to use at the hotel. I arrived back just after 4pm and found them in the lobby restaurant snacking on apps with very low stress (if any) about the room being slightly delayed. The room was ready within 15 minutes and we were told we had very nice room in the main building with a view of Alcatraz and Coit tower. \r\n\r\nOur room was actually the Piazza suite, traditionally (beautifully) appointed with a large dining area and pull out couch for the kids. Both the bedroom and living area looked out over SF bay - great views! The Piazza suite was perfect for us, - comfort and privacy, from two youngish children. We had a quick room service dinner that was delicious, and dashed out to the Giants game and got back after 10pm. The room was quiet, sleep was uninterupted with very good black out draw shades, and the bedding was very comfortable. \r\n\r\nAltogether a very nice hotel with premium service and classy, traditional surroundings.

What surprised me was that it was very, very noisy. I heard people coming down the hallway yelling to one another, I heard people having sex, and what sounded like revealers returning to their rooms late in the night, not caring about the noise they were making. I was surprised that the rooms were not a bit more soundproof, and it felt more like a Motel 6 experience.\r\nNeedless to say, I did not fall asleep until at least 1 am and woke up late and did not get to see as much of the city as I was hoping since I ended up falling to sleep so late. \r\nOther than that, the staff were very nice, the check-in and check-out process was very smooth.

Our room was exceptional - we had a view of the city and the bay.  Every member of the staff we came across was very accommodating, kind and pleasant.  They helped us with a smile and followed up.  Definitely speak with the concierge.  Thomas was especially helpful.  The trolley is a must do for a first time tourist.  Mass transportation is at the bottom of the hill.  We visited Golden Gate park (which is a lovely family day out - there are museums on site), Fisherman's Wharf, Chinatown and a tour on the ferry towards Saucelito.   The hotel is on top of Nob Hill.  If you choose to walk, just know one has to go up and down very steep hills to get around.  Although San Francisco is a walking town the hills do slow down progress - there are exceptionally steep hills around Nob Hill -exceptionally steep.  Keep that in mind.   \r\nThe only con to our stay was a convention which came to the hotel one day into our stay.  This meant swarms of very rude guests which made eating in the hotel restaurant impossible (it became loud and rowdy) and getting around the hotel tricky.  The convention people changed the atmosphere of the the hotel.  They were ill mannered: shoved past us, took over the lovely lobby, and were just plain rude.

In my opinion, all rooms in a five star hotel,  should have the same standards, regardless of the floor or rate one paid.   Rooms and hotel in general  should be exceptionally clean, odor free, and pleasant for all guests.  If Fairmont choses to not make improvements, perhaps it should be renamed \"The Fairmont Five Star DOG hotel\".","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":1,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":1,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Pasadena, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2015-06-23T18:03:50Z","roomTypeId":200153342,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"18200","reviewId":"55898d74f46e91097c5184ef","photos":[],"itinId":"1106241368976","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"CRMD REMOD HMP MMD","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Meredith","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Old school SanFran","reviewText":"The old Fairmont Hotel on Nob Hill is a beautifully maintained \"old school\" hotel with classic old decor and modern amenities.

The place is in a perfect location to move around the city located in Nob Hill it is perfect to wonder around the best areas of the city. A good issue on the original building rooms where we stayed is that we asked for a room with a view, if you have an inner patio room they have an awful look of the inner building which is really unpleasant for a place like this. We didn't get to know rooms in the tower but I think those have a better comfort and space.\r\nThe hotel was allways with a lot of buzz and action ranging from weddings to conventions and private parties. Restaurant for breakfast was allways packed and they do not have enough space even using the bar tables. So we passed on having breakfast there.\r\nAmmenities in the room are good and bed is comfortable and clean. Bathroom in our room was small for a Fairmont and even uncomfortable with the tub/shower disposition.\r\nDinner was excellent and well served but on the pricier side, even though very well appointed and prepared.

I know it's not guaranteed, but it would have been nice if they accomodated us. Instead we got a room on the 5th floor right near the elevator. We understand we can only request, but it was a bit disappointing.\n\nThe other issue we had was with the room. Though it is very beautiful and tastefully renovated, the bathtub was just plain gross. I understand it is older, but the grout was all yellow, and the tub all dingy just from pure age. The tile also looks like its seen much better days. Around the toilet it also looks yellowed from age. The window had a beautiful view, but there were gaps around it so wind was blowing in. We stuffed up the big long cushion against it to help cut down on wind blowing in. Granted, the rest of the room had been recently renovated, so it looked nice so nothing to complain about that.\n\nSo in a nutshell, good if you want the character of the older Fairmont building, the image that comes from being at a Fairmont, and friendliness of staff.

Further, we made a note that this was a honeymoon booking on Expedia and the hotel had chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of sparkling wine in our room when we arrived. We had fun touring the hotel itself and viewing pictures of the famous singers and movie stars that had been in the hotel.\n\nOne note, I wish it had been strongly recommended or clearly stated that the Tonga Room is impossible to visit on the weekend and that it is closed during the week. We planned on dining there upon our arrival on Saturday night and had no idea that the line would be out the door and down the hall. We thought we would hit it on another night while we were there, but it was closed during the week, so we missed out on it. That was disappointing.\n\nI will say the staff was friendly and helpful when questions were asked.

Sit back in the bar/lounge area in the plush over-sized chairs and sip on a classic cocktail while listening to the grand piano. The Tonga room is quite a site to see. We did not eat there, but peered in to see what looked like a super cheesy Polynesian restaurant that one might find in Las Vegas or Hawaii that is tourist hot spot. That being said, if we made another trip with our kids, we would make it a point to stop and eat (for the experience). The rooms are nice, but are room never cooled down to a comfortable temp. The windows could also use some TLC to be brought back to their original glory. Love the balconies and long hallways with real wood doors to the rooms. No fridge to store leftovers, microwave, or coffee maker in room, but for our 1 night stay it was not an issue. FYI... for those traveling with children, our 11 yr old son thought it was a really cool place and would like to return, while our 16 yr old son was bored (but aren't they all).

The room was also very spacious. The location is ideal as it is cloe enough to everything, but far enough away on top of Nob Hill to offer a quiet and relaxing stay. We utlized the public transaportaiton system to visit all of the neioghborhoods and could catch a bus or cable car within one block of the hotel. Note: if you wantot ride the cable car, the Nob Hill pick up is tough. Since this is a major tourist attraction and the stop is at the top of the hill on both sides, the cars are typically full when they come to this stop. Very few people get off here, so it is hard to get on the car at this stop. We did find that if you are out and about at or before 8:30am you can catch the cable car here.

For $250 plus a night you do not get WiFi...they have the nerve to ask for an additional $20 per day.....come on guys....Motel 6 gives you free WiFi (not cool these days when everybody is on the internet). I had to go to Starbucks to check my email...I refused to pay extra on top of the room fee's. It's not that the place was bad, it just wasn't nice enough. The room is clean (I had to move into a second room...the a/c wasn't working in the 1st room!)...the view was nice from the 21st floor (but that was SF not the Fairmont).

They had the right balance of warmth with professionalism which makes a stay at the Fairmont so wonderful. Our room was especially spacious and immaculate ! The only down side to our whole experience was a young heavy set doorman/bellman named Kevin. Being the first point of contact with the property, you would expect him to open the door of your car, smile, welcome you to the property and offer assistance. Unfortunately, none of that happened when I arrived, but instead received quite a bit of condescending tone in Kevin's voice and \"I'm going WAY out of my way to help you\" attitude. His manager needs to remind him that being the first contact to the property sets the tone for the guest's experience, and that he should be more polite and helpful. Attitude and tone of voice used when being addressed makes a tremendous difference in making a first impression. Otherwise the stay at the Fairmont was excellent !!

The hotel itself is beautiful and grand. It has every modern convenience yet retains it's old world glamour.\n\nMy only complaint is that the hotel isn't really near anything. To get to any restaurants other than the ones in the hotel, one must catch a cable car down Powell St. to Union Square or a ride to Fisherman's Wharf.. It's not a long ride, but after a long day trekking around the city, sometimes the last thing you want is another ride/walk up/down to Union Square. This is also true for breakfast in the morning. Unless you want to pay top dollar for the hotel buffet, your only option is a little coffee shop attached to the hotel (Cafe Cento) on Powell St. Otherwise, it's down the hill you go.\n\nI'm not sure I would stay there again, but it has nothing to do with the hotel itself, rather the location of the hotel.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"The staff are friendly and helpful; beautiful views from the tower.","negativeRemarks":"No reasonably priced restaurants in the hotel.","locationRemarks":"Not optimally located near major sight-seeing areas.","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"San Antonio, TX","reviewSubmissionTime":"2013-03-17T20:19:23Z","roomTypeId":359987,"userDisplayName":"Karen","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"18200","reviewId":"48415059","photos":[],"itinId":"154438024329","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":1,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Howard","brandType":"Expedia","title":"A terrible tired hotel","reviewText":"1st room was so small that bellhop advised us nt to accept it.

No information on what types of stores or merchandise they may sell.\nTwice we felt like having a drink in the lounge attached to the Restaurant just off the Lobby and it took 14 minutes to be served the first time and after 10 minutes the second time we walked up to the bar and ordered directly from the bartender.\nThe walls in our room are paper thin....I have never been in a hotel where you could hear every word that the next door guests were saying. Need less to say my wife and I either whispered or texted each other to keep our conversations private.\nIf you want a coffee, you have to go down 3 levels below the lobby and past the indoor garage to a coffee shop otherwise you get charged $ 18.00 for a small carafe.\nAlthought this is a beautiful hotel, it s shortcomings far outweigh its grandeur and I would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking for quality service or privacy in their room.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2012-11-26T20:27:02Z","roomTypeId":177864,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"18200","reviewId":"40440004","photos":[],"itinId":"152144250844","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Dawn","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Beautiful Landmark Hotel","reviewText":"The Fairmont is a beautiful, historic landmark hotel in San Francisco.

It's a nice taste of the good life. With that said, this place is not for the budget conscious traveler, even if you get a deal on the room. The parking is $55 / day, the breakfast is $30 / person, even WiFi costs extra. Come prepared to spend money like water and you'll get the most out of it. How terribly proletarian it would be to quibble over something as trivial as the bill, don't you think?","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"Decor, ambience, location, sense of history, helpful staff","negativeRemarks":"No free wifi","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Vancouver, BC","reviewSubmissionTime":"2012-09-17T19:03:10Z","roomTypeId":5070,"userDisplayName":"Richard","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"18200","reviewId":"38761618","photos":[],"itinId":"149881635907","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"George","brandType":"Expedia","title":"San Francisco Trip","reviewText":"The room we had was next to the main street and it was a bit loud.

The woman at the check-in desk was very helpful but then directed us to an awful touristy restaurant after we specifically said we didn't want a tourist spot. We spoke with 2 concierges and both were dreadful and knew nothing. It was not at all what one would expect from the Fairmont.

The minute I stepped off of the elevator and onto the fourth floor, I was overwhelmed with a musty and stagnant smell. It was clearly noticeable to me all three days we were there. When we entered our room, it was neat, but very dusty in places I would expect a hotel of this caliber NOT to overlook (tops of door frames, draperies, but especially near the head of the bed between the bed and nightstand or the bed and the wall). Clearly cleaning that requires moving furniture or stepping on a stool is not being done. The icing on the cake was the gum stuck to the desk near the bed, clearly visible to anyone who sat on the bed. My husband and I will try a different hotel next time we visit San Francisco.

Expedia had only 2 rooms left at a price almost half of the hotel's published rate. I was concerned that because of this discount, I would get rooms close to elevators, ice machines. Our rooms were perfect! Clean, quiet, luxurious! The hotel is huge, so the walk to & from places is a long one.\n\nOur family loved the Tonga Room, a Polynesian kitschy bar/restaurant with a live band floating on the lagoon in the middle of the room. (Best for adults).\n\nThe weekend brunch in the Laurel Room was great. The sticky buns were to die for. Pricey, but expected in these surroundings. Be aware of the fact that the tip is included in your bill for this buffet!\n\nThere is a roof top garden which is very pretty. A Hertz rental car office in the lobby. The hotel's British concierge was not the friendliest, however. Our kids loved the work out room. I loved to walk outside & see the cable cars going up & down the hill. We used cabs, as the hotel parking fee is $60 a nite. My son did rent a car for one day & it was great driving up & down the hills, seeing the Palace of Fine Arts, Seal Rock, all the different neighborhoods.\n\nWe all definitely recommend the Fairmont, on Mason St. on Nob Hill. The Fairmont has another hotel at Ghirardelli Square, way to touristy! ALso, I think you have a better chance of getting these rooms on Expedia if you can reserve way in advance!

We usually stay at the Westin on Market Place, but we decided to try out the The Fairmont. Extremely glad we did! Beautiful historical hotel with out being old (flat screen TV's, etc..) if you know what I mean. Great decor throughout the hotel from the lobby to the suite we were in. The balcony suite was simply gorgeous! However, I will never fly United Airlines again to San Francisco. We were booked on a small plane that the captain had to ask someone from the first 4 rows to move to row 11 to even out the weight of the plane before take off. Hmmm I should of seen it coming. Our return flight was cancelled because it rained earlier that morning. We had to fly stand by to LAX and our vehicle was in ONT. Lucky enough to get out on the next available flight and rented a car in LAX another (2hrs and $100 later).

It was also my daughter;s 14th birthday and she's interested in architecture. I wanted someplace soothing for me and interesting for her and was able to book at the last moment.-a bit of a splurge. Her jaw dropped when she saw the lobby, it really is so welcoming and just has that feel of old time San Francisco glamour. I love this hotel - even though I didn't have a deluxe room, the rooms have tall ceilings, huge closets, comfy robes, great beds and linens, fabulous pillows, and the location on Nob Hill is outstanding. The staff at the Fairmont is attentive and the room service is fast, my only desire is for a different dining room-similar to what they use to have on a higher floor with the stunning views and a piano bar. The Tonga room is for some a tradition and the food is OK to good, but not outstanding. However, the hotel staff directed us to a fabulous little Italian Cafe in the Nob Hill area. This hotel is not cheap but worth the charge, I definitely recommend it for romantic long weekends or for parents with older teens who want to learn a little bit about San Francisco history and enjoy the architecture, sites, and sounds of a great city.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Kailua-Kona, Hawaii","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-08-25T11:38:55Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Families","categoryLabel":"Families"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"18200","reviewId":"17744341","photos":[],"itinId":"324690359","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Sue","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Fun at the Fairmont","reviewText":"The Fairmont was classicly beautiful.

(Although I question why they would assign the room to a guest knowing the inconvenience in the first place.) The majority of the staff was helpful and professional, with the exception of one woman at the hotel's Hertz rental car desk who was incredibly rude when I inquired about renting a vehicle at the hotel. She actually said \"I already answered one question - how many more do you plan on asking? My husband and I ended up renting from another rental agency who not only picked us up at the hotel, but charged a significant amount less.

Imagine $7 for a beer that only costs $1.50 tops. Talk about feeling ripped off. To top it off I was charged $1.50 for a fifteen second local call that costs nothing. There was no proper fan in the bathroom and the shower was a bathtub with a shower curtain. Not good enough.

The staff was nice, food is extremely expensive ($8.00 for a glass of milk) and the rooms are just very average. Location is excellent as you can easily get anywhere in town from the hotel. Workout gym is decent but early mor Inge it is crowded with locals so it's best to wait until 10ish to use the treadmills and machines. We'll try a different hotel next time in the same area. The room was never really cleaned that well as we found 2 pair of socks (not ours) andunderwear (again, not ours) under the bed when we checked out.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":2,"ratingHotelCondition":1,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Las vegas","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-12-30T15:56:32Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"18200","reviewId":"17744254","photos":[],"itinId":"294410914","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"citlali","brandType":"Expedia","title":"amazing start to our honeymoon","reviewText":"everything about the hotel was amazing. parking was pretty expensive, but thats expected in the city, the room service was quick and delicious, the view was perfect, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was clean.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"sandy ut","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-12-30T15:48:10Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"18200","reviewId":"17744535","photos":[],"itinId":"302135501","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Erin","brandType":"Expedia","title":"A San Francisco landmark.","reviewText":"We had a wonderful stay.

I was dissapointed with their customer service when asking them for directions to certain site seeing places (they were very rude and seemed very eager to hurry up and get to the next person in line). Overall this is a great hotel but does need improvement on their customer service. The AC also needs to be fixed in the rooms (barely running and not that cool).

All in all, it was an experience that we are glad we had and we would definitely recommend it to everyone.

Basically a snack bar. This place had limited eating facilities for the average traverler with children. There was a few very nice cafes within walking distance. For lunch the cafe at Nob Hill was great Italian. For breakfast Roxan's was very nice. The hotel just did'nt provide what the modern traverler is used too. I travel almost once a month all over the world and usually enjoy Fairmont Hotels, but this one is not going to see me again.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Corona del Mar, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-04-29T14:04:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"David","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"18200","reviewId":"17744521","photos":[],"itinId":"264557236","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"E.B.","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Outstanding Experience","reviewText":"Not only did the Fairmont staff treat us as if we were royalty, but they let us check in early and gave us a 2-bedroom suite!

In the restaurant, a \"full tea\" with tiny sandwiches for a child is $25 and $36 for an adult. I skipped thisand my daughter and I shared a dessert and one small pot of tea in the bar, but every dessert is $10 so this tiny snack was about $20 with tax and tip. You get the idea. That wouldn't be so bad except there are no reasonable restaurants or cafes nearby. Also, you're on top of the highest hill in S.F. so even the 3-4 blocks to China town is exhausting to walk and you need a taxi to or fro, etc. The nearby cable car is often too croweded to get on and is $5 per adult if you don't have a pass. I highly recommend a pass. It's $18 for three days for an adult and $10 for a child and works for cable cars and trolleys, although sometimes the wait is so long and they don't go everywhere conveniently (e.g. 1 hour from the Wharf). Even with passes, I still took some taxis (e.g. to Golden Gate Park and to/fro the Asian museum because it was more convenient.

Walking distance to many major places and right next to 2 cable car routes. They kindly stored our luggage before actual check in time as we arrived early. They did the same thing on our last day since we were not flying until the evening. Thus, The bell staff were very friendly. The bad: We got the Fairmont room on the 2nd floor. It was supposed to be a queen bed, but it was surely a double bed. The first night, there was a wedding happening underneath us so we could not sleep from the thumping music and singing. Called front desk, they laughed and said maybe we can get you ear plugs. I hung up, quite unhappy. The party did not end until 2am. They should not have issued those rooms if it was going to be so noisy! We never got the complimentary newspapers each morning. Someone put a big bottle of Evian water on our table in our room when we got back one evening. We did not order it, nor did we touch it. The next morning, we found a bill for $10 underneath our door asking us to pay for it... The housekeeping was inconsistent. After the 2nd night they took away the carpet in the washroom. Because of the Evian water incident, we decided to inform the front desk beforehand in case they decided to bill us for the stink'n carpet. They also did not replace the shower cap. Overall, it was just a so-so stay. I chose it just because we got a good deal on Expedia.

The hotel offered a special sale we took advantage of. We were immediatley offered a free upgrade to a tower room at check-in. This is a classic old style resort hotel. I would not recommend it for families with small children or even for most young adults. We had no negative experiences at all. The staff was very helpful and the concierge one of the best I have dealt with. We rented a car one dy from the Hertz desk in the hotel and it was the most pleasant experience I have ever had dealing with rental car agencies. The room was clean and spacious. My wife thought that the linens could have been better quality ( higher thread count), but the bed was comfortable and it was one of the best and largest bathrooms I have found in a hotel. Visit the Tonga Room , maybe have a drink but I would suggest skipping dinner. Nothing worng but for the price much better food can be found. Breakfast is expensive in the hotel. The buffet is fine and there is a good ala carte selection. Skip the buffet and order ala carte. You get more food than you can eat and save significant money. Plenty of other options if you want to walk toward Union Square, but face it, eating in San Francisci is expensive. Overall a great experience, but watch for a sale because at the rack rates I would not advise choosing this hotel.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Atlanta, GA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-08-07T12:09:39Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"18200","reviewId":"17744703","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"David","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Perfect room, great deal.","reviewText":"We stayed in a suite in the new tower.

The location is right in the heart of San Francisco and both Chinatown and Union Square is within walking distance. There's a cable car right behind the hotel that you can take to go down to Fisherman's Wharf. The hotel itself is very classic - a victorian feel to it which is hard to find these days. There's a hall that has pictures of hundreds of celebreties or important people that have stayed or vistied the hotel over the years - including Reagan, Kennedy, etc. The only draw back concerning the facility is that the room does appear somewhat old.Despite the updated appliances (LCD) and rennovations, there still is a sense of \"oldness\" in the air. Well, I guess if the hotel is over a hundred years old, you would have to expect this. But having said that, I would still prefer Fairmont's \"antiquity\" feel over any of Hilton or Marriot's monderness any day. Another draw back is of course - the price. It's not cheap! We were somewhat lucky and got a discounted summer package.

We had to call the next day to ask where it was. The two different times that we called the concierge (for transportation), we were put on hold for quite awhile. We found we were served better when going to the desk. The elevators take a long time to get to your stop. Patience is key. The cable cars run outside the hotel doors, which is convenient, but expect to wait 1/2 hour before being able to board.

My concerns are as follows: no robes, no DND sign, only the basic bath amenities, broken steam iron, light in bathroom not working, key card stopped working twice. Because I arrived late, I ordered room service (bad idea), the order taker was rude and tried to discourage me from ordering saying \"it will be a 90 minute wait\".

The staff was friendly and accommodating. We didn't have much of a view, which was unfortunate because this hotel is atop Nob Hill and the views from there are phenomenal. One of the selling points of this hotel is that it is right on the cable car route. Besides cabs, cars and walking this is the only way to mount the excruciatingly steep hills. The cable car is almost always full of tourists going for a ride, and is not a consistent way to get to the top. Being pregnant and having to climb those hills was a killer. If you plan to have your own vehicle, or are in really good shape, this is one of many places to stay atop Nob Hill. We got a really good deal on the room, but could barely afford to eat there. Everything is very expensive. There are some really good restaurants in the area, and the hotel is mere blocks away from Chinatown.

The room was very clean and all furnishings were in great shape.

When we started rolling it in ourselves we passed two managers/security in the lobby and weren't stopped until we passed the bell desk. There was a long line at the front desk for check-in and found out from our bell-woman that there was a front office staff meeting and that they had failed to have sufficient coverage at the desk.

We had a large, marble bath, a walk-in closet, flat-screen TV, the linens were sooo nice and the bed was luxurious. And the service was phenomenal. When Expedia messed up our reservation by not telling the hotel we reserved 2 double/queen beds, the hotel gave us 2 rooms with single queen beds right next to each other and couldn't have been nicer about it. They said this had already happened multiple times. The concierge helped us make dinner reservations, rent a car, reserve a shuttle back to the airport, gave us advice, and was pleasant while doing all of this. The lobby of The Fairmont is amazing. The only negative is there are not many options around the hotel for eating/drinking, although there are a couple. The new coffee bar downstairs makes great coffee.

We also thought the price of extras like parking and the restaurant were high and these added a considerable amount to the overall cost of staying there. Having said that, an enjoyable stay for a one-off experience.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Milton Keynes","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-08-10T14:06:38Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"18200","reviewId":"17744331","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":2,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Kristie","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Expected more...","reviewText":"When we phoned the concierge for assistance with tickets, they asked if they could call us back.

Valet: Surprisingly, this was a prompt and efficient experience. Typically, when we stay at other hotels for events in SF, the valet is totally unprepared for the volume. Car was also waiting upon check-out. Check-In: There were several employees checking-in guests, so this was also a prompt and efficient experience. Elevators: This is a very historic hotel with historic elevators. If you are in a hurry, you will be disappointed. Rooms: We stayed in a room on one of the higher floors. Although the room had a queen bed, it reminded me of hotel rooms in Paris & Barcelona. In other words, very very small. Also, in the a.m., we could hear every single word spoken by the couple next door which was disturbing. Several years ago, I stayed in a suite which was a better experience. Bar Food: Over priced & too fancy if you are starving - even for S.F. I suggest getting a bite somewhere else. Tourists enjoy the Tonga Room which was a totally cool bar in the late 90s. I have also stayed at the Fairmont in San Jose & Chicago.

In truth, this did not detract terribly from our stay, but less able and willing visitors or those wishing to be in the middle of things would do better to stay in a different part of the city. That aside, the service was impeccable, and nothing about the Fairmont is cheap (breakfast $26 each, parking $51 per day), so if you're looking for quiet romance and price is no object, the Fairmont is a great spot.

The service was impeccable from beginning to end at the porte cochere, front desk, bell desk, lounge, Crown Room, and everywhere else we went. Car rental was available on-site, and was equally pleasant. The food and view from atop the new tower was fantastic, and housekeeping was impeccable. The only real nit was a little bit of paint wear and scuffing on some doors and woodwork. Also wish the windows would open more than a handspan. If you truly want to experience the elegance of old San Francisco, this is the place to stay. I'd go back in a heartbeat.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Studio City, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2006-11-29T23:33:16Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"18200","reviewId":"17744829","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Gene","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Mixed Review","reviewText":"The checkin was incredibly slow for the President's Club which I am a member.

Despite a reasonable arrival of around 6:45 I noticed a long line for check-in and only 2 staff members, one of which was handling the club clients. I headed to the Tonga lounge for a cocktail and the tail end of the $7 happy hour buffet. Lounge is downstairs from lobby at end of drab hallway across from gym. Nevertheless, it is fun it a slightly tacky way with the hourly rainstorms and floating bandstands. Yes, they put mini-umbrellas in the typical repertoire of tropical drinks. When I went back to check in, line was short but only one person was working the front desk. At my turn, it took 5 minutes of searching before they said no garden rooms were ready yet as of 7:30 PM so they upgraded me to tower. Room had a nice view and was reportedly slightly larger, but I had hoped for more character by staying in older section. All in, hotel is nice and I will assume check in was out of character but I prefer the better neighborhood restaurants selection in the Union Square area.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Seal Beach, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2006-09-20T15:36:45Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"18200","reviewId":"17744926","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Val","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Very nice place to stay","reviewText":"will recomend to others for any event.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"St.Louis, MO","reviewSubmissionTime":"2006-09-20T11:28:34Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"18200","reviewId":"17744925","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Susan","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Would go back in a heartbeat!","reviewText":"We had a wonderful stay at The Fairmont.

Would recommend this lodging.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Amador County, California","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-03-01T03:04:42Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"JMom","reviewerCategories":[]}]}}}

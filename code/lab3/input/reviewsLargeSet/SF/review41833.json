Beds were very small ....  the one bed was right up against the window which  was open with dead bugs on window sill like never wiped off.  The bed spread from 1970 s looks like never washed .. Found someone's hair on it !! Freaked out too because they made a copy of my credit card and license on check in ... I did request copy back when left right away .. Which  manager shredded infront of me . I hope it was the only copy made !!! Just felt odd .. My 15 yr son thought it was odd as well !!!!  Sooooooo VERY DiSAPPOINTED!!! If just looking for cheap place not too far to walk from the Wharf and don't care about cleanliness or clutter then it might work out !!  One positive .. The girl at the front desk was very pleasant and outside of building looks cute !!! Remember old saying ... Looks can be deceiving .

We had to lug our huge suitcases up 2 flights of stairs to get to our room, but assistance was offered to us to help.  The room was small, like so tiny we had to open our suitcase on the bed because there wasn't enough floor space, but this was acceptable because we were really only using the room to sleep in.  Our \"window\" opened to an indoor hallway right next to another guests \"window\" but at least it gave the impression of more air coming in.  The bathrooms, although shared, were clean and we never had to wait for the toilet or shower.  Softer towels would be nice, but that's really my biggest complaint.

The hotel is over Restaurant Fior;  a meal here is excellent Italian fare -- friendly staff.  Be warned, however -- the hotel is a one-flight walk-up from the street;  and many rooms are an additional flight (or two) up from there -- there is no elevator.  Some of the small rooms have no outside access -- no windows for fresh air -- and, with no air conditioning (though with ceiling fans), the rooms can get quite warm.  Excellent connections with Lorrie's Shuttle from the hotel to the San Francisco Airport for about $14.00 per person;  be sure to make your reservation at the hotel front desk at least a day in advance of your trip.

Tiny rooms, shared facilities, and a general communal feel give this hotel charm like few others.  The rooms are tiny and only some have sinks, so be sure to reserve a room with a sink if you have that particular need.  The San Remo isn't luxurious, but what it lacks in modern amenities it makes up for with a general sense of old fashioned living.  \r\n\r\nIf you're looking for a place to stay in bed and watch The Discovery Channel, try the Travelodge down the street.  If you want to have a real experience, the San Remo is a great jumping off point.  Fisherman's Wharf is about a five minute walk.  The surrounding area is full of restaurants and bars to suit any taste or price point.  For those who want to go a bit farther astride, downtown is about thirty minutes away on foot, but it'll take you hours because of all of the things to see and do on Columbus street, the main drag leading directly to the TransAmerica Pyramid.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, the San Remo is a throwback to Victorian living that offers no modern distractions (save for a washer and dryer onsite).  After your long day roaming the streets of Chinatown, grab a good book and a bottle of wine and chill out if your simple, quiet room at the San Remo.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"Cozy, experience-oriented, close to many tourist activities.

It has shared bathrooms, which are really nicely looked after and accessible, so don't be surprised by such things. We didn't find this a problem at all. \r\n\r\nWe would stay there again.

It's nice, as long as you don't come in expecting some large corporate style hotel with all the modern things. There's no TV in the room. The beds and furniture aren't the newest. The people at reception don't understand the concept of early check in (though they're nice enough about storing luggage in the manager's office while you go about town waiting to check in). The toilets and showers are shared. There isn't much in the way of sound-proofing, so you'll hear any conversations in neighboring rooms even if they're not raiding their voices. So why did I like it? It's got a certain charm to it. You can help yourself to coffee, ice water, even chocolate brownies at reception. There are interesting old photos, and other stuff all over the walls, even plants growing around the place. You feel you are staying in a place with character and rough around the edges charm. And of course it's cheaper than anything else you're likely to find in such a good location. They left us an offer in our room on the day before departure: $50 for another night if we wanted it. We couldn't stay, but would have considered it under other circumstances.

Rooms are tiny and there seem to be a lot of rooms per bathroom. However, the bed was v comfortable and firm and everything was super clean. Fresh towels available and constantly replenished on rails by bathrooms, which were cleaned several times a day by smiley staff, and waiting for bathroom was never really an issue, so initial concerns vanished quickly. The location is great, close to Fisherman's Wharf, but back from the seedier touristy bit and by a Trader Joe's and Ralph's market. Cablecar car is close too. Excellent value for money as all nearby hotels are 3 or 4 times the price. Front desk staff extremely helpful. I would recommend avoiding a room near the bathrooms, as you might get disturbed by late night visits and flushing! We had a great time here, but I am not sure I would want to stop here first, if I had come off a long flight, unless you are a heavy sleeper. It's not really noisy, it's just that that the rooms are packed close together and you are very aware of other guests' movements up and down the corridors. I must say though, I am usually a bit squeamish about shared bathrooms, but the staff really do a good job of keeping them clean and the paper seat covers and mats are appreciated.

It reminds me of hotels in rural Germany in the 50's and 60's. Safe neighborhood, no bedbugs, spotless, virtually unremodeled since its construction right after the earthquake in 1906 (to house crab fishermen.) Remember, at the time, bedroom pretty much = bed + room... Mine also had a pair of nightstands with reading lamps, a bureau with mirrors, a wardrobe, and a chair; that's it. Electricity updated and to code; plenty of outlets. Now for the historic part. The sink was down the hall, complete with standard plus lighted shaving mirrors, etc. The shower cabins and hamper for used towels were also down the hall, so you may wish to pack bathrobe + slippers. Next to the shower cabins in the hall were the presumably original toilets, connected by a handsome brass pipe to the water tank enclosed in a lovely wooden encasement, above your head. Flush, of course, is triggered by pull chain. If you come in late, don't worry about waking the night desk clerk; there isn't one. You're given two keys when you register, the key to the room, and the key to the front door of the hotel, so just let yourself in. There's free (good) coffee in the morning, and a most helpful staff. This is not a hostel; you have your own, lockable room. But it's pretty much a hotel in a time capsule.

The hotel decor offers a nostalgic charm that hearkens back to its 1906 origins. And I thought the locations was great, since it's near Fisherman's Wharf and just a block from the Powell and Mason cable car line. I was attending a conference at Moscone Center, on the other end of the cable car line, and I appreciated the excuse to take the cable car across the city. And the room rate was not too hard on my professional travel budget.\n\nMy room was tiny---just enough space for a double bed, with a bit of room to move around the bed. I have a penchant for quirky hotels with small rooms, and I was unperturbed by this. No television, but I never watch TV when I'm traveling on my own. I was happy that I had enough space to pull a chair up to the bedside table and work on my laptop.\n\nThe San Remo does have some downsides. It does not have en suite bathrooms. I worried that I would find myself in competition with other guests for the showers in the morning, but as it happened I never had a problem. The front desk is only open from 8 am to 10 pm, so I barely crossed paths with the desk staff. And they didn't have enough irons the first night I was there.

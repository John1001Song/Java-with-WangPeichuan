It was great.  A rather quick ride from SFO on the BART to Embarcadero station and then a long, very nice walk along the Wharf or an \"E\" or \"F\" bus to within  a hundred yards or so from the hotel.  Great location.  Check-in was efficient and when I asked about directions to the football game, the front desk attendee had us get going way sooner than I thought I needed to in order to get to the game with time to spare.  We were grateful as our plans would of had us missing pregame fun stuff and part of the game.  Our room was perfect-small and efficient and very comfortable beds.\r\nThe next morning we ate breakfast at the Blue Mermaid restaurant that connects to the hotel.  Wonderful breakfast.  I saw an award for \"best chowder on wharf\" and although a long shot, I asked if I could get some.  Our waiter checked with the cook and he was able to get us some crab-corn chowder at about 8:30 in the morning.

The location is great if you want to be in walking distance to cable cars, and the pier.  The staff was very friendly (especially Donovan).  Here are my issues:\r\nParking was an additional $57 per night.  That is ridiculous!!! When we needed our car it took a half hour for them to bring it around.  It made us late for our dinner reservation.  \r\nRooms were a little small for a hotel.  The walls are so thin you can hear everything!  Water pressure in the shower was so low.  \r\nWe received a card with our welcome package (Which was just handed to us and not explained at all) that said they have a wine tasting everyday at 5:00 as a meet and greet but when we went down to ask about it we were told that they don't do that anymore because it was too expensive.\r\nRefrigerator in the room is for purchase use only.  (Soda, water etc) No microwave in room but they do have a coffee pot and coffee.  Beds were very comfortable!\r\nOverall, it wasn't terrible, just not as nice as I had hoped.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"Location to Pier","negativeRemarks":"Do the wine tasting again.

We needed to drop our items quickly to get our rental car back before it closed in Union Square. The men were so nice and allowed us to park there and told us to take our time checking in and getting our things. Check out was a breeze and we were gifted a room upgrade from a standard king to a king suite because \"it was our first time there! So nice! For San Fran the room was HUGE! VERY comfy linens, robes, towels, and bed. Less than 5 stars for condition as the pillows were all super squishy and there was a high pitched humming noise that slightly bothered my husband. I am sure had we cared so much to ask they would have accommodated with other pillows or changing our room, but we were in there so little didn't matter. Free wifi was very strong signal - nice! The concierge was awesome - great recommendations for transportation to airport, set up a car for us quickly and was so kind and polite.

My husband called several weeks before our trip for a restaurant recommendation .   He wanted a quality Italian restaurant with a romantic setting.   Upon their recommendation we went to Sociale and I must say it was neither good food  or Classic Italian.  We both left 3/4 of our meal as it lacked any flavor .   My eggplant Parmesan was so thick and hard to cut, and my husbands beef dish lacked any flavor at all.  It truly tasted like beef boiled in water and then dressed up to deceive until you take a bite of nothing .  So upsetting!!! As far as romantic setting goes , the garden is lovely.

We took Amtrak from the Central Valley of California to Emeryville and then the Amtrak bus to Pier 39, so we didn't need to contend with driving, parking, etc. in San Francisco.  It was an easy walk to the hotel.  One reason we chose the Argonaut was that it was fairly close to Pier 39 but away from the major tourist congestion and noise.  Being next to the park and beach and just down the hill from Ghirardelli Square added to the fun.  We chose to take advantage of the convenience and celebrated our \r\nanniversary dinner at the Blue Mermaid.  That too could not have been a better choice.  Everyone (12 of us) all chose from the variety of meals listed on the menu and no one was disappointed in his/her choice.  Our attentive and friendly server, Brian, made the evening even more enjoyable.  The concierge was helpful in giving us suggestions on how best to get our granddaughter to SFO so she could fly back to Syracuse University.

There is a wine tasting / wine bar thats part of the hotel but it closes quite early - it ouwd be great if that could used to service the lobby after it closes.  There is a mini bar in the room and its not too expensive.  The rooms are fine, the bathrooms are a bit dated but they are clean and there is a fitness room which is sufficient.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"location","negativeRemarks":"Hotel bar service could be introduced.","locationRemarks":"Trolley car terminus.

The hotel was a mixed bag.  The location is great for tourists, as it is fairly central to ALL of the tourist attractions of San Francisco.  The facilities are well kept, the decorations are wonderful, and the architecture of the room very attractive.  Our room was enormous (We had reserved a king suite), with an ample living and dining area complemented by a spacious bedroom.  The furniture was comfy, the bed was extremely restful, and everything was clean.\r\nThe poor part was the front desk staff.  They were terrible.  Our reservation was lost, and they treated us as though this was our fault.  Even after showing them proof of payment and booking, we were told that we would be responsible for payment again while they were straightening out the issue.  They did finally and magically \"find\" our reservation.  \r\nUpon check out the next morning, the nice woman at the front desk asked how our stay was, and I was about to mention the only was that no one came to replace a light bulb as requested and the noise, but, before I could even get those words out of my mouth, she interrupted with the details of the parking charges.  Conclusion, we're told to ask, but we don't really care.\r\nIf you have to have the best location, stay here.

Room was excellent with a very comfortable mattress and feather pillows. All the basics are there in line with a hotel of this category. The staff were all extremely friendly and welcoming.\r\nWe found the location perfect. It is to one end of Fisherman's Wharf so away from all the intense touristy bits but still only a 10 minutes walk to Pier 39 (the official wharf) and a 15 minute walk to Pier 33 for Alcatraz. Lots and lots and lots of eating places within minutes of the hotel!!\r\nTransport links were excellent with the Powell-Hyde Cable Car end-station a 2 minute walk away and the F Line trams about a 3 minute walk in the other direction. Several tour bus companies have their start points near the hotel.\r\nThis was our first trip to San Francisco and the hotel was absolutely perfect for our tourist needs.

If you're not in great shape, consider getting a cab to Pier 33 because you will have enough walking at Alcatraz.\r\n\r\nThe room was nice, although I thought the bed would be softer for the hotel price-point. It was very hard and lumpy. Valet is expensive ($50 per night...but it is San Francisco, so that is to be expected). Staff were very nice and accomodating. The room was well-stocked with munchies, drinks, robes, umbrellas, etc. Overall, a very nice place to stay right on Fisherman's Wharf.\r\n\r\nBe sure to buy your Alcatraz tickets FAR in advance! They really do sell out months in advance! Also, if you are going for a Christmas trip, the city really doesn't go all out for Christmas. Very few buildings were decorated.

He found a great deal through Expedia.ca. The trip included airfare and hotel accommodation down by the wharf in this beautiful city! The hotel is known as the Argonaut, it is a Kimpton Hotel. It is also situated in the heart of the bay area surrounded by the water to one side and the wharf to the other. Alcatraz is within view from the hotel. We arrived on a Saturday night to a warm welcome and a bottle of Champagne with 2 glasses and a lovely hand written card from the staff of the hotel welcoming us and wishing us a Happy Anniversary and a great stay! We were just thrilled by that gesture and by the smiles and warm hello's once we arrived at the hotel. The hotel also made arrangements for a driver to pick us up at the airport which was such a bonus. Although we paid for this service it was worth every penny to have someone meet us at the gate of the airport, and help us with our bags and get us safely to our hotel. I felt like a movie star! The hotel staff helped us with all our day trips and were always friendly and willing to assist us if we had any questions regarding sight seeing or other issues. Also in the evenings the hotel has a wine tasting hour which is fantastic for anyone who would like to meet other people staying in the hotel.

The WiFi is bad - slow if it worked at all. The 5:00 wine tasting every night is a great idea. Grab a glass of wine and get ready for dinner. Its a nice, comfortable hotel. No bad issues.\nBut the Argonaut could have, it doesn't, but it could have some major faults and still be forgiven because of its perfect location. Out your front door is the wharf and all its entertainment. Its at the end and out of \"some\" of the crowd. Not all for sure. Cable cars just up the next block. Pier 39 a short walk the other way. And in between the Alcatraz cruise pier. Vendors for tours everywhere. My advice, go, take all the tours you can afford and fit into your schedule. We did. Napa - Sanoma, Muir woods - Sausalito, Alcatraz, Bay cruise, Cable cars, Pier 39, Ghiordelli Sq, etc etc...All the reasons you would stay on the wharf are close to the Argonaut.\nYes, if I go back to San Fran I would stay at the Argonaut.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"Location","negativeRemarks":"WiFi","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Pittsburgh area","reviewSubmissionTime":"2014-02-19T19:23:13Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Rip","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"hotelId":"915510","reviewId":"66484659","photos":[{"thumbnailUrl":"https://a.travel-assets.com/ugc/hotel-reviews/BBB652397FD9ADC9B2C5D152709AB4C1F6DA233C.jpg?resize=100:*","normalUrl":"https://a.travel-assets.com/ugc/hotel-reviews/BBB652397FD9ADC9B2C5D152709AB4C1F6DA233C.jpg?resize=360:*","caption":"Room"},{"thumbnailUrl":"https://a.travel-assets.com/ugc/hotel-reviews/1CC1D3D22FA56C5086B383E555EB8B331A37030F.jpg?resize=100:*","normalUrl":"https://a.travel-assets.com/ugc/hotel-reviews/1CC1D3D22FA56C5086B383E555EB8B331A37030F.jpg?resize=360:*","caption":"Best sour dough bread"},{"thumbnailUrl":"https://a.travel-assets.com/ugc/hotel-reviews/F50E4A663F0A2BB45ADBA4ECA4501283DA6AD53A.jpg?resize=100:*","normalUrl":"https://a.travel-assets.com/ugc/hotel-reviews/F50E4A663F0A2BB45ADBA4ECA4501283DA6AD53A.jpg?resize=360:*","caption":"Entrance"},{"thumbnailUrl":"https://a.travel-assets.com/ugc/hotel-reviews/183FC0FD9F110046FC7BF2CEA1DEA2BEE7034D72.jpg?resize=100:*","normalUrl":"https://a.travel-assets.com/ugc/hotel-reviews/183FC0FD9F110046FC7BF2CEA1DEA2BEE7034D72.jpg?resize=360:*","caption":"Lobby with fireplace"},{"thumbnailUrl":"https://a.travel-assets.com/ugc/hotel-reviews/4CBD285B057D0C15E9363F562A4A2FDA19491144.jpg?resize=100:*","normalUrl":"https://a.travel-assets.com/ugc/hotel-reviews/4CBD285B057D0C15E9363F562A4A2FDA19491144.jpg?resize=360:*","caption":"Free bikes for touring"}],"itinId":"168640133165","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Joni","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Excellent Boutique Hotel in the heart of San Fran","reviewText":"From the moment we drove up to the door to the send off, we were amazed by this unique hotel and wonderful staff!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"We loved: casual but elegant atmosphere, location, staff, restaurant, cleanliness, happy hours.","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"Fisherman's wharf, cable car station, Ghiradelli Square, tours to Muir Woods, Saucalito, wine country","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"sarasota, florida","reviewSubmissionTime":"2014-02-19T18:47:39Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Joni","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"4","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_ca","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"915510","reviewId":"66406352","photos":[],"itinId":"163167252623","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"4105","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Expensive catches, inexperienced guides","reviewText":"Great place but we were just beside Barking dogs.

Lombard street is only a few blocks from the hotel as well. The roads are very steep from the hotel to Lomabard Street so we took the cable car and got off there. The other time we took the cable car right to Union Square. Such a unique experience. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful in many ways.

Sign in the bathroom says if you forgot anything that they have it, or they will go get it (including cell phone and computer chargers, hair straightener/curlers, even a carryon bag for your plane--- unique offerings).\nBest of all is the excellent location with tons of attractions just few minutes away. Cable car entrance around the corner.

Bay area the Napa Valley, our last night before returning home was spent at the Argonaut. While the staff was courteous, they seemed somewhat less than genuine at the front desk. The doorman service and valet were the most helpful. The size of our room made it difficult to control the room temperature evenly throughout the large space. Additionally, a large shelf located in the shower stall broke away from the walll. When I reported this to the front desk, the clerk seemed mildly amused and notified the \"Executive Housekeeper\" who neither acknowledged me nor apologized for any inconvenience. The shower was very difficult to regulate and difficult to find a comfortable temperature range. Finally, we utilized the concierge to recommend a restaurant in S.F.'s famous North Beach section known for its fine Italian food. The concierge made her suggestion saying \"This is the best.\" We were sent to an establishment that not only had markedly bad service, the food was mediocre at best. To top it off, on leaving the restaurant, we hailed a taxi and when we asked to be taken to the Buena Vista, one of the city's more well known pubs, the driver said, \"I'm new and I don't know where that is.\" We had to provide the directions!

While nothing was particularly horrendous I left feeling slightly underwhelmed. The hotel is pleasant, clean, well located and fairly spacious although the public areas are less than adequate. Probably the main source of dissatisfaction was Fishermans Wharf itself - it's now grossly commercialised with gaudy and cheap seafront shops. It's not a reason not to stay there per se, just know what you are heading to. Head left out of the hotel in the direction of Sissey Fields and Golden Gate bridge and things are much more pleasant, especially when the sun shines.\nBack to the hotel - rooms are a good size, ours was clean and well maintained but bathroom was small and more dated. We only used the restaurant for breakfast and found it to be on the expensive side with charges for all refills (niggle). The food however was good. No free wifi (niggle niggle) in the hotel but you can pay a daily rate - surely a hotel of this standard and expense doesn't need to skim you for what is now a travelling necessity. Staff were pleasant at all times but tended to be slightly aloof.\nDining tips if you do choose to go - avoid the Wharf and head up to North Beach (10mins walk max). There are numerous great restaurants dotted around Washington Square. Particularly commend Original Joe's (Stockton/Union st) for brunch or dinner, Cafe Divine (directly opposite) for excellent breakfasts and Cafe Sport on Green St for seafood.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"Views of Alcatraz","negativeRemarks":"Wharf tat","locationRemarks":"Probably the best that you will get on the Wharf but still VERY busy","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Uk","reviewSubmissionTime":"2012-08-19T15:45:22Z","roomTypeId":492699,"userDisplayName":"Ian","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Families","categoryLabel":"Families"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"915510","reviewId":"37992499","photos":[],"itinId":"147970297060","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Gail","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great for families or couples","reviewText":"Cute boutique hotel in the heart of Fisherman's Wharf.

There were folks out for their morning swim close to shore, lots of healthy people jogging and riding bikes (it was maybe 7am). On the other side of the hotel was pretty much every touristy thing you could want -- plenty of places to eat, get snacks, shop, book tourist activities. There were three Starbucks within just a couple of blocks.\n\nI was on a really fast trip in and out of the city for business and pretty stressed out. There wasn't anything at the hotel that added to my stress. I had one of the extra large rooms, so there was plenty of room for me to spread out and work, run an iron over my clothes, etc.\n\nIt's not the kind of place where taxis are sitting outside and when I was going to checkout, I realized I might have to wait -- which caused me a little angst, but before I even got to the front desk someone approached me and asked if I needed one and they had one for me within a couple of minutes.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"Location.

Our only complaint was that they told us the parking would be $70 and online it said $46. I picked this hotel because of the $46 parking but they said because we had a large vehicle it would be $70. We were told this when we checked out - not when we got there. They did finally agree to lower it to $46 this time. I would love to stay there again but the high cost of parking may deter us.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"The goldfish for the kids.","negativeRemarks":"The high cost of parking for our SUV","locationRemarks":"Perfect spot!

Ii forgot an envelope in the back seat, called the hotel and even when i was no longer a guest there, the doorman remembered me, remembered the cab driver, contact the agency, put me in the phone with them and 15 min after, the cab driver met me at a the right terminal to give me my documents. They really fulfilled all my expectations in every sense, because the hotel is nice and cozy, the location is amazing, they are all very helpful and willing to answer questions or fulfill a request at any time.\nAlso, complimentary wine from 5 to 6 is great too, provided by (also) friendly people.

Travelling with our children we found the Argonaut well situated and it gave us great access to everything on the waterfront. The room was a little cramped but the service and cleanliness was excellent. Rooms with only one bed are more spacious of course. I would go back to this hotel without hesitation, we were definately impressed by the service level right from when we arrived and were directed by the bellboy, to when we checked out in the wee hours of the morning. I rented a car which I would not do again if I was staying at the Argonaut, the Cable car stops right outside the door and heads right down to Union square so it really was a wasted expense. We did go for a drive across the Golden Gate but that was all we used it for. You can walk everywhere on the Waterfront or catch the Cable Car and the F Line at any point which adds their own element of tourism to the trip. Also Parking is difficult, and adds even more expense.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Vermilion, AB","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-12-01T14:31:42Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Families","categoryLabel":"Families"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"4","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_ca","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"915510","reviewId":"17687543","photos":[],"itinId":"339159707","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"4105","userNickname":"Kristi","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Would definitely go back","reviewText":"The hotel was beautiful and the staff were very friendly and helpful.

The views from every road are different and always stunning. Cycling across the Golden Gate bridge is a must followed by cycling up the bay on other side to look back onto the City. The beaches aren't really for swimming, but good for a visit and chill out. Coit Tower and Twin Peaks display fantastic views of the city and not to be missed. Golden Gate park is also fantastic and Lumbard Street is very interesting! Union Street has a lovely feel to it and wasn't in any of our guide books. It is a really nice mix of independent shops and food places. We also hired a car and went down the coast to Santa Cruz which was a pretty town with the 6th oldest rollacosta in the US.

Our room was very clean, spacious with a great view of Alcatraz (which the kids thought was really cool). The restaurant and wine store in the hotel were great, and even the fitness room was decent/better than average. Staff were very friendly and helpful, particularly the bellmen/valets and the girls at the front desk. The reason I only gave \"Service\" a rating of 4 out of 5 stars was because the housekeeping seemed to come at odd times (either at 8:00 a.m. - while we were still getting up - or late in the afternoon when we were coming back from a day of walking around/sightseeing, etc.) and when we first arrived the room had a strong perfumey smell - like bad hand lotion - that took a bit to either get rid of or get used to (not sure which). At the end of the day, we will definitely be back the next time we're in San Francisco and I would HIGHLY recommend the Argonaut to anyone looking for an upscale hotel that caters to tourists looking to enjoy the sights and experiences the Wharf area has to offer.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Winnipeg","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-08-03T05:27:35Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Families","categoryLabel":"Families"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"915510","reviewId":"17687188","photos":[],"itinId":"324164326","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Anne","brandType":"Expedia","title":"San Francisco Argonaut","reviewText":"The Argonaut is in a great location.

Can't wait to try another Klimptons.","reviewText":"My wife and I had a wonderful week in San Francisco mostly due to The Argonaut. The location is so convient words cannot express it. Right on Fishermans's Wharf, you cannot get any closer to the action then this place. We did the \"tourist\" thing, Alcatraz, ride bikes across the Golden Gate Bridge, Union Square, Chinatown, Sausolito, the second most crooked street (Lombard Street), Coit Tower, Muir Woods, shopping, eating, tolley's cable cars, Hop on Hop off busses, if it was touristy we did it!\nGetting around San Francisco is quite easy when staying at the Argonaut. You are right next door to a cable car (busy) turnaround, a block and a half from the bus stop to go downtown (always a seat available) or just walk. Get a map, figure out the shortest most direct route and walk the streets of San Francisco. From the Argonaut to Union Square/Chinatown is a relatively easy walk of 50 minutes and if you get lost you will see other parts of San Francisco that most tourists miss.\nThe hotel was very clean, staff were exception! Steve the Doorman (a super guy) is a crazy baggage cart driver, if you have kids with you make sure they get a ride upon arrival. The 5-6 wine reception is a great way to meet fellow travellers and share some stories. Our room was on the inside so no view but it was exceedingly quite at night considering how busy Fisherman's Wharf can get.\nAll in all, we would be back in a minute if the opportunity arose.

The view was really of other rooms overlooking a concrete pad so courtyard is a bit of a misnomer.\n\nThe hotel is in the renovated Cannery building right on Fisherman's Wharf next to the Hyde Street cable car turnaround-great location. The architecture of the building is really cool and it was decorated with a nautical theme. The beds were comfortable (although the pillows weren't) and the room size was adequate for the amount of time we spent there. The rooms are a little dark though (especially since you really can't open the shutters unless you want to wave at the folks across the way as you get dressed!) and the bathroom fixtures are all in one space. We like having the sink separate from the tub/toilet area so more than one person can be getting ready without the shower steam problem and there is only one sink in the bathroom.\n\nWe took advantage of their free wine reception one evening and the wait staff from the restaurant also brought out some drink samples and appetizers.

This was by far and away the best hotel experience if you are a family and seeing the sights of SF (not doing business). The theming is great, and fits the area perfectly. My son (11) really enjoyed that everything was nautical, right down to the Maritime National Park you could enter right off the lobby inside the hotel! The staff was incredible about providing excellent service and making a special effort to be friendly and make sure we enjoyed our stay. The location could not be beat. We walked to everything we wanted to see, or took the cable cars conveniently located across the street. In fact, our room had a particularly nice view of the cable car stop and turn around. I don't believe that all rooms had as good a view or large windows judging from the exterior, however. We stayed 3 nights, and kept expecting the charm to wear off, but it did not. If you are looking for the deluxe posh hotel experience, this may not be your hotel. It is definitely family friendly with a fun atmosphere, though. And the rooms were clean, well maintained, and comfortable. On a 2 week trip in California that included stays in 6 different hotels, this was by far and away our favorite hotel and truly increased our enjoyment of our time in SF.

Once checked in, it suprisingly offered a wonderfully themed atmosphere reminscint of a stay at a Disney Resort. The location is everything expected. It is in close proximity to the street car to go to Union Square, multiple bus stops, and--of course--Fisherman's Wharf. \"The Blazing Saddle\" bike shop is right next to the hotel entrance, making it easily accessible to rent a bike, go across the Golden Gate Bridge, and return it conveniently. The staff was extremely helpful and courteous. During the time of this review, there was a wine reception during the evening hours. As a result, as come travelers were checking in, they were also greeted with a complimentary glass of wine. Wine aside, when asked for dining recommendations, the staff never missed a beat and responded quickly and effectively based on what mood you're in. Overall impressed with the hotel. When compared with other lodging, there are a few short comings. The room size is a bit smaller, but with the ornamental decorations, its very easily overlooked. Also for some reason there was no fan in the bathroom. In order to battle fog from a hot shower, the a/c had to be turned on.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"San Diego, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-09-16T14:45:59Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"915510","reviewId":"17687220","photos":[],"itinId":"285815814","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Rick","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Highest Recommendation","reviewText":"Was very pleased with the Argonaut hotel.Friendly and helpful staff.

We walked everywhere- maps of the city are easy to obtain and follow. We got a City Pass, initially for the attraction tickets, but it also includes unlimited riding on the cable cars,the MUNI buses and street cars for 7 days. The MUNI system is CLEAN and will get you wherever you want to go in the city. The cable turn around is next to the hotel- very busy from about 9:30 in the morning til late at night.

I felt safe all the time, and had no noise at all in my inside room. The hotel was very well kept up, and there were service people around any time they were needed.

I pulled up and got \"Welcome back, how was your day?\" rather than, are you a hotel guest? It was just wonderful service.

Service was excellent - from the doorman to the front desk agent - all were warm and friendly at every interaction. The location is not the prime spot and leaves a little to be desired, but it is pretty convenient to many San Francisco attractions.

Unfortunately, it's quite some distance away, and we couldn't even see it sometimes because of the fog. The room was small-not enough tables or surfaces, & the 4 of us stumbled all over each other the whole time. The bathroom doesn't even lock--it just has a pocket door, & there's no exhaust fan in there, either. The shower was great, though, so that's a plus. Be prepared to leave the hotel if you want to get any food for even a halfway reasonable price. The staff is nice enough & willing to direct you elsewhere to get less expensive meals than what they offer there. The location wasn't as convenient to the amenities of Fisherman's Wharf as I had hoped, either. Everything we wanted to do was several blocks away, further down Jefferson Street and closer to Pier 39, for example. Getting to the pier for Alcatraz Cruises was an exceptionally long haul.

The hotel is well-maintained and its facilities user-friendly. The deluxe King room I got was very large - so large that they could have put a round table in the middle just to make it seem less empty. Despite the hotel's charm, I was disappointed at the level of service I received. When I checked-in at 2:30pm, I was told by a very rude and unhelpful receptionist, Artel, that our room was not ready and we could leave our bags with the hotel and come back half an hour later. When I enquired whether other rooms were available, his response was: \"you just have to come back later.\" I find this level of service entirely unacceptable. I'm disappointed at the lack of professionalism exhibited by this front desk staff at this hotel. I had a great time talking to bellmen, and even the ever-so-helpful doorman.

He carried on great and funny conversations with us while repairing the lights, while making suggestions for things to do on our trip. The hotel restaurant was less than desirable however. We had our dinner there on the first night and the seafood was overdone and greasy. Even though I'm sure room service comes out the same kitchen, the food that you order via room service was much better! Their concierges are miracle workers! We wanted to try out Garry Danko, a fine dining restaurant just up the block, but notorious for requiring reservations two months in advance to get in! If you don't want to sit at the bar that is. We asked the concierge around 9am and by the time we returned to our hotel at 5pm, he'd scored us reservations for later that same night! Don't miss the nightly wine and cheese reception!

The rooms were clean, freshly decorated and well-equipped. Check-in was swift and courteous and the conceirge was knowledgeable and efficient. Whilst a lot was made in hotel's marketing information about its 'nautical' theme, in reality, this did not have an immediate impact - it appeared indirectly through nautical-inspired materials for the soft furnishings. On the down-side, we found that the cleaning staff attended at our room very late in the day, in fact, one day so late that we were back in the room and we went for a day without the room being tended to. Also, the hotel is on a busy tourist thoroughfare at Fisherman's Wharf and, during our stay, was very busy, although the hustle and bustle from outside could not be heard in the room. This hotel is a safe option - it is clean, comfortable and in a convenient location. It does not quite live up to its marketing hype: we never saw any complimentary tea/wine afternoons in the lounge, the nautical theme is none too apparent and the rooms, whilst very nicely decorated, were not outstanding.

Our room was big but the bathroom was small and only had one sink. My biggest complaint was the desk staff. We had arranged, and re-confirmed, late arrival. We got there at 11pm with 2 exhausted kids. The only unoccupied room of the type we booked had been \"flagged\" by housekeeping in the computer and the desk person could not tell why. She was very confused and it took quite a while for her to figure out what to do. Eventually, she sent a bellman up to see if the room was made up, and thank goodness it was. When checking out, we requested an hour late check out, (it was a Monday) and the same desk person was on duty and just shook her head and said no. No explanation, no apology, just no. Also, during our stay, both of our key cards had to be re-activated to work. The concierge helped with tour information, but pushed only one tour company. We were told very snottily that it was too late for us to go to Alcatraz because every single Alcatraz tour was booked until the next week, but we walked down the street and were able to get a tour to Alcatraz that afternoon. Breakfast at the hotel restaurant was pretty good but very expensive. The bellmen were very nice and helpful. It's truly a shame that the other personnel issues dampened our opinion of the hotel, because it really has a lot of positives to it.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Sparks, MD","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-08-30T01:53:47Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"915510","reviewId":"17687267","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Katie","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Unique Hotel","reviewText":"The hotel is sea themed from the rooms with star fish pillows to the lobby with big white sales in it.

The other issue with the room on that side of the building is the entire BLOCK walk to get to our room from the elevators. The side of the building we were on had a staircase labeled for staff use only, but we used it anyway for a quick escape to get outside since it was such a long walk otherwise. There are no vending machines on the property and the hotel restaurant is expensive and served us cold breakfast. Stock up before you go. We didn't take the mini bar key because of the outrageous prices that usually come with minibar access. Fisherman's Wharf is close, about 4 blocks away.

There was also a sleeper sofa, DVD player, and honor bar.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Fresno, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-06-25T16:25:55Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"915510","reviewId":"17687861","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Scott","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great Location, Ambiance and Price","reviewText":"This hotel was the most economically priced of any located in the Fisherman's Wharf/Ghirardelli Square area on Expedia, but was beautiful, quaint (with a fishing/naval theme), clean, well maintained (read as \"new everything\") and perfectly located for a visit to San Francisco's bayside.

We had debated staying in Union Square, and felt very lucky to have selected such a clean and convenient location that was right on the water. The concierge directed us to phenomenal restaurants every night, and we used a MUNI pass to get everywhere. Best restaurant: Hunan Home's in China Town.

We feel certain that the beds were Double or Full sized (we have both at home, and the Double ones aren't big enough for us to sleep in comfortably side-by-side). I think the hotel should publish the dimensions of the beds, since they seem to have a sizing system that is different from the rest of the world.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Dallas, TX","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-04-24T02:22:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"915510","reviewId":"17687479","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"jubro","brandType":"Expedia","title":"absolutely nice and cosy hotel","reviewText":"Excellent \"Mermaid\" Restaurant","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"mexico city","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-04-24T00:36:48Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"915510","reviewId":"17687481","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Ronald","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Romantic Getaway","reviewText":"This was a very relaxing trip.

On our latest trip to NYC & and the West Coast, the Argonaut was an exception. It is a wonderful boutique hotel but don't be put off by the boutieque tag, it has excellent service to match. Also, it is in a very touristy part of San Fran (Fisherman's Wharf) but there was absolutely nothing to suggest a touristy hotel. The room seemed to have been totally refurbished only a couple of months ago, and the quality of furnishings (especially the heavenly beds) was top notch. It is a bit pricey but I don't mind spending if I know I am getting real class. We would highly recommend this hotel and we will stay again! If you are in San Fran for a few days as a tourist, there is no better place. I was with my family but if I am in San Fran on business, I would probably choose this place too, rather than stay downtown which is relatively boring. A tip for those bringing a rental car. Try and get a hybrid car like a Toyota Prius - valet parking is normally $38/ day but free for hybrids (there is no self parking). The hotel is within walking distance of Pier 39 (where most tours start) and also Pier 33 (Alcatraz ferry) although that's a solid 12 mins walk. Many places to eat within 5 mins walk, and shops selling the usual touristy fare.

If this is where you want to be, this is the hotel for you (especially given excellent discount rate at Expedia). But be aware that this area is a long way out from the downtown city centre, and from the BART system, though you can get into this by taking the nearby cable car. Hotel staff were polite, efficient and friendly and, most importantly, switched my room without fuss in a few minutes. The reason I changed is because my room was effectively at street level and I did not want the noise or intrusion that this would create. As this almost certainly applies to a lot of rooms, I suggest you ask for rooms on 3rd or 4th floor when booking. The rooms were large, well equipped including free internet connection, and well maintained and cleaned. Having a free glass of wine at 5:oopm is a great bonus if you are around then. I also used the gym facilities which were fine. Breakfast is not included and that's probably good news. There is a hotel restaurant which is open for all three meals, but it is relatively expensive and not particularly special.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Hertfordshire","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-03-26T18:57:58Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"4","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_ca","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"915510","reviewId":"17686530","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"4105","userNickname":"Carol","brandType":"Expedia","title":"great stay here","reviewText":"We had a great visit first time around. hotel was clean and comfortable, I always missed the free wine hour. liked that the trolley bus was just around the corner and the trams were on the other side.

(I'm writing this with the sorest ears after having to wear ear plugs every night for a whole week, just to get a bit of shut-eye). The only other issue was with the food in the hotel restaurant. This was probably our fault for booking a hotel so near a waterfront reknowned for its seafood, but as much as I'd like to try out the local food,I have a severe allergy to shellfish and there were only two dishes on the main menu as an option.

All the employees were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is also in a great location. All the shops and great places to eat so close to the hotel. Ghiradelli Square, trolley cars, fisherman wharf were all within walking distance. It's the old Delmonte packing facility that was changed to one of the most adorable hotels I've stayed in.

All the staff we encountered from the moment we arrived were helpful and friendly and nothing was too much trouble. The room was really clean and beautifully decorated and the beds so comfortable. Some guests have stated that the walls were so thin that they could hear their neighbours conversations but we did not encounter this problem. The Argonaut is in a prime location close to many major attractions which saves a lot of time especially if you are only on a short trip. Don't bother with the Blue Mermaid restaurant, we only tried once for breakfast but the service was really poor. Try instead 'Joanie's Happy Days Diner' which is just around the corner on Columbus Avenue. They do great breakfast at a good price with excellent service. Get there early as its really popular and gets very busy. If you get the chance, hire bikes at Blazing Saddles next door to the Argonaut and cycle over the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito. If you enjoy fresh fish seek out a restaurant called 'FISH' where you will have a great lunch. Last but not least if you are planning to visit Alcatraz (which is a must) book well in advance as tickets do sell out well in advance and many people were turned away on the day. Next time we visit San Francisco we will definately be staying at the Argonaut so don't delay book today.

The doorman, reception staff and the bell boy were all so enthusiast, and not just about the hotel, but about San Francisco in general. They couldn't stop talking about where we should go, where we should avoid, and continually offered their services for any queries we may have. They really could not have been any more helpful if they had tried. The room in the Argonaut was stunning. The decor is of a nautical theme, but it is done in such a tasteful way. The rooms are large, with a really comfortable bed and a good sized bathrooms. The hotel also benefits from the usual facilities associated with a large business hotel, only this is not! The Argonaut has the feel of a small boutique hotel, and the attention to detail is a credit to all staff working there. A nice touch was the wine tasting held in the lobby each evening. Beers were also available, which was nice, as I had a real taste for the Anchor Steam Beer, brewed in San Francisco.

Our room was pristine with all the extras you would expect (toiletries, dressing gown, TV, Video games etc) And what a good idea the free wine (and beer) tasting is, every evening the chance to meet other guests and sample some great wine. The hotel is has an excellent location -2 minutes from a small beach area, a 10 minute walk along the shops to Pier 39 with it's shops, restaurants and the famous Sea Lions, 2 minutes to the cable car stop (get there early to avoid the queues) Not a bad word to say about the hotel, can't wait to go back!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Essex","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-08-17T19:13:26Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"915510","reviewId":"17686728","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Louie","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great location, Excellent Service!","reviewText":"It's on a perfect spot, right on Fisherman's Wharf and the decor is great.

This hotel is \"in the action\" on the wharf, and is in easy walking distance of several of the city's best sights (Embarcadero, Ghiradelli Square, China Town, and of course, the Wharf). The hotel is in a converted brick warehouse, and has a rustic charm from the outside. Inside, however, it has a sleek, modern maritime decor that somehow feels warm, clean and fresh. The rooms are spacious, very clean, well prepared, and very welcoming. I would DEFINITELY recommend the bay view room. The bellhops, doormen and valets were all eager to please and very serviceable. The restaurant (Blue Mermaid) is very good, as well. In my opinion, the price is a great value and we had a great time. The ONLY problem, and this can be a big problem depending on where you want to go in SF, is that you have to pay for parking (as much as $50 a night if you have a big SUV) and you must valet. This is a big pain if you need to get stuff from your car or intend to drive anywhere. However, they do allow you to pull your car up anytime you want without further charge (aside from tips).

Windows did not open meaning that aircon was necessary all the time, this was fairly noisy. We didn't have a sea view, looked on to other rooms, so meant we had to keep blinds shut for privacy. The worst thing was definately the paper thin walls, I could hear complete conversations word for word. As I had read in previous reviews, I can confim that the concierge is absolutely useless, it may as well be non existant. There were two different people on duty during our stay, and neither were helpful. They do not (or can not?) book anything for you, and can not acurately tell you costs/times of anything. If you want to know something your best bet is to ask the doormen who are helpful, polite and friendly. The other point to note should you decide to stay in the hotel is that on check out, or on check in if your room is not ready, they offer to store your bags for you. But be warned, they just put a label on them and leave them in the enterance hall, meaning anyone who wonders in can help themselves- it is certainly not a secure baggage store.

I had read many complaints about air conditioning in hotels in this city but found the Argonauts to be in fine working condition. The setting of the hotel right on the water was a particular delight; each morning I went to Starbucks (a short block away), bought a donut and hot tea and sat on the sea wall and enjoyed watching the boats, Alcatraz, the G.G. Bridge, swimmers in the harbor, the beautiful Western Gulls and all the runners, walkers and bikers. My husband took advantage of the running/biking trail that begins about a block from the hotel, running along the water, winding up through the Presidio and even across the G.G.Bridge into Sausilito if you desired.

Beautiful decour, wonderful staff....from the doorman to the front desk! The rooms are just as beautiful in person as they are in the pics you see. The beds were comfortable and the room in perfect condition. The Argonaut is even an attraction in itself, it's one of the stops that the double decker bus tours stop at. I suggest buying tickets, they let you \"hop-on, hop-off\" for say, lunch in Chinatown or a day at the SFMOMA. Then they'll bring you right back to your wonderful hotel.

Everyone at the hotel was super nice and had no problem with our request for a late check-out on Saturday. The hotel is a little noisey. But nothing to worry yourself with.

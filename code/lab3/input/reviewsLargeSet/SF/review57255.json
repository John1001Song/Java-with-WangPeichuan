The room was very dark because of the very small window with no drapes.  The fixture overhead was very dim.  My room was n the fifth floor.  The elevator only went to the 4 th floor.  I had to drag my luggage up a narrow flight of stairs around the back of the building to the fifth floor.  There was no alarm clock and had very thin walls with no sound proofing.  I could hear the couple next door engaging in coitus.  There were black hairs n the shower.  I humored the next morning when an employee was carefully monitoring the guests for the very cheap breakfast of only carb and no protein options.

Stacy made my friend and I feel like we were coming home to visit mom who hadn't seen us in a year. She explained everything to us so throughly and we felt like we could ask her 100 questions without her being bothered by us. Her energy was so refreshing and it was great to have our first interaction with someone a postive one after being on the road for 5 hours. I could seriously write a book about how much I adored this woman. Just know, this hotel is clean, smells good, no bugs, no dirty sheets, comfy beds, big shower, beautiful view of the Golden Gate Bridge, very nice pool area, great working a/c in the room, and QUIET at night! the free breakfast was basically all breads (muffins, bagels, literally sliced bread, croissants, waffle mix to make your own waffle, cinnamon buns without the sauce) a bucket of apples and not ripe bananas, small cereal bar with regular milk, orange and apple juice, and coffee. not a great selection but it's free so whatever.

We got an awesome rate around 150 a night and had two queen beds with plenty of space, a big tv, safe, nice bathroom, very cool view of the courtyard, excellent soap and shampoo etc.  And now for the good stuff:  In the courtyard there is a heated pool open until 9 pm all the time, there is a totally decked out gym with a steam sauna that's brand new and rocks, the breakfast buffet has like six pastries, yogurts, hardboiled eggs, muffins, toast your own toast, great coffee, juices, and a WAFFLE MACHINE!!!  Yes. As if this were not enough, there is a lobby area with internet and computers and leather couches and tv to just hang out, and omg the BEST dimsum restaurant EVER downstairs called \"dim sum club,\" and we're extremely difficult to please in that department.  So, why didn't I give five stars, a hundred percent maximum rating to this great little hotel?  The one tiny downside (for me) was that our room was very mildewy smelling and I am asthmatic.  I had to use my inhaler two nights in a row, just to sleep.  And I got a row of horrible, bright pink bites on my wrist and finger the first night, which I have come to learn are bedbug bites.  I want so much to say that everything was perfect.  And I think it would be, if they would replace carpets.  And I will venture to say that probably not all rooms are like ours - most guests looked very happy and unbitten.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"Comfortable beds, good shower & soaps, plenty of space, cool courtyard, great pool and sauna, great gym, fantastic breakfast, dimsum downstairs","negativeRemarks":"Our room was so musty I needed an inhaler.

Our view was mostly ugly rooftop but did have the Golden Gate Bridge in the distance. It was really quiet. Our 2 year old was likely the loudest noise anyone had to deal with. So that's the good stuff. \r\nThe amenities are beyond basic. Bathroom had shampoo, conditioner, and body wash available. They were low quality and stripped my hair and skin. A few towels were available, no wash cloths. Coffee maker made disgusting coffee. The second bed in our room was actually a foam modular couch that was oversized so you couldn't put a sheet on it very easily - and it was pretty stained so you needed one. It was hard too so very uncomfortable. Kids slept on it but I wouldn't put a discerning adult on it. Parking is available for $33 per night and it's not easily accessible from the rooms. The elevator makes levels 3-5 available but you have to walk outside to get to levels 1 and 2. Probably weird quirky San Francisco stuff, but annoying nonetheless. \r\n\r\nOverall nothing completely offensive and I'm being a tad nitpicky, but I'd choose another place next time.

Not at all like SoCal folks!\r\n\r\nThe hotel itself is older and therefore has its limitations. For instance, since it was originally built in the days of no air conditioning, the owners have installed portable AC units in every room. These are rather noisy when running as a fan, but get noisier yet when they kick into cooling mode. The rooms do not have any light blocking curtains installed, but rely rather on blinds which do not quite do the job. Between the AC units and the light coming in from their hall lights which are on all night, it was a chore to get a full nights sleep.\r\n\r\nFree breakfast is included, but it is definitely lacking in variety. The only protein served is cold, hard-boiled eggs! And the only thing warm, other than toast, is their waffles which you make yourself. Plan on waiting in line 10-15 minutes before you get a chance to make your waffle on busy mornings. \r\n\r\nBut all that said, the combination of price and location make this a decent hotel to stay in.

The property is dated although they tried to update it. Our room was a corner but cramped, so relatively quiet, but it overlooked the parking deck (no view) , had no air conditioner (very stuffy) and accessible only from an exterior door (very motel-like).  The property is a maze and strangely configured.

It's location is ideal because you get the san francisco experience without being high profile.

However, the inside is much nicer, and we found the old look made our stay safer because the building doesn't attract attention. Just like the rest of the city, parking is expensive.

China town, fishermans wharf, Lombard St., Union square, pier 39, street trolleys.  The gentlemen at the front desk was extremely helpful and polite.  He also set up a city tour and trip to Sonoma, CA for a wine tasting tour last minute.  I rate 5 star for brand new luxury hotel, 4 star for a older once a 5 but still overall a nice \"luxury \" hotel ,3 star is just a older run of the mill (nothing special ) just a little pop what you would expect clean hotel.  The rooms are very large and clean.  Only things I would have liked to have but did not would be another elevator, microwave, mini fridge, bath tub (did have nice stand up shower) bigger flat screen (room is rather large and the distance from beds to the tv makes it hard to see) hot tub ( does have nice pool and surrounding area) overall great comfortable place to stay in a great location and wouldn't hesitate to recommend staying there to  anyone.  If your expecting Trump Towers plaza and have big dollars to spend this is not it.  If you are a working middle class that needs a large, nice, clean ordinary hotel for decent price $180 per/nt which is what I thought after hours of searching every hotel site I know of a good price for the location and that it was a 3 star.  I've seen dumps for more. But the \"luxury\" 4&5 star Hotels run $3-$400+ per/nt anyhow if the price is right get it.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Grand Rapids, Michigan ","reviewSubmissionTime":"2015-05-14T23:09:45Z","roomTypeId":200099330,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"hotelId":"57255","reviewId":"5554c586e4b0fa4429df56a1","photos":[],"itinId":"1103288260367","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"MMA HMP","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Cherie ","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great Location","reviewText":"The room was clean but the bathroom was very cramped with a very small stand up shower.

We noticed that this hotel was very popular with larger groups of college students. If you are a regular traveler with some need of basic comfort and a good night sleep, then this is definitely not the right place for you! We felt very uncomfortable in this hotel. While the first room had a portable air conditioning unit, the second one had only fans. No matter what the temperature was outside, our inside temperature was always around 80F. It felt so hot and stuffy the entire time (we stayed 4 nights) that we had to leave the room door open frequently in order to let in some fresh and cool air (rooms go directly to the outside). For the same amount of money I have stayed in much better places in San Francisco. They charged us an extra fee of $20/night for the friend my daughter brought with her, while not providing any extra towels etc. and we paid $30/night for parking. So the $50 in addition to the room fee did not make this hotel a very good deal and I wish that I had never booked it in first place. Needless to say that we will not return.

It is relatively close to the Wharf, but remember - you are in San Francisco- lots of hills!!!  So the first day, the walk was tough.  We had a room that was on Van Ness, so traffic is non stop and loud.  Not the hotel's fault! Staff did assure us that they are renovating many rooms. My one complaint, which they said they are addressing is the bathroom. There is just one small sink with no vanity table or counter. There is only one small mirror in the bathroom, that's it! There is a desk, but no vanity lighting and no mirror.  We traveled with our 2 small children. Someone is always in the bathroom, so getting hair/make up set was a challenge. There is a nice pool area. Too bad SF is on the cooler side, we could not use it. Morning continental breakfast was nice, big selection. My young children liked making their own waffles.  Unless you plan on living in the hotel, the accommodations are great. I would not hesitate to stay at the Da Vinci when visiting SF again. There is also laundry facility available.

It is a retrofitted building, so not all the rooms have a unit in them. BUT, I don't think it's ever been so warm in San Francisco that you would need it; I only used it for some white noise and air circulation when I went to sleep (since the ceiling fan was acting up). Traffic noise from outside is minimal with the window closed.\n\nI would stay here again; my only problem is the price. I have to ask, is it worth it to pay this much per night?

The bathroom was spacious, although the shower head was fairly low for my 6-foot-something boyfriend.\n\nThey charge for parking and parking is not first-come-first-serve, so when we came back late one night there were no spaces left in the \"garage\" so we had to park outside toward the street. (Something to consider)\n\nContinental breakfast is good. Variety of breakfast drinks, waffles, bagels, pastries, cereal/oatmeals and fruit.\n\nLocation was convenient for trips to the Wharf and less than 20 min to AT&T park or Union Square.\n\nI recommend trying the restaurants off Union St. If you stay here!\n\nOverall I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a nice room, willing to sacrifice the usual hotel building environment, at a decent rate with a good location.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2014-01-06T19:11:35Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"E.AA","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"57255","reviewId":"64368426","photos":[],"itinId":"166003565586","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"","reviewText":"","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":true,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2014-01-05T18:00:42Z","roomTypeId":200318278,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"57255","reviewId":"64292284","photos":[],"itinId":"166474234394","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Average","reviewText":"Thought the day time staff was not very friendly - but the night time staff was very friendly and pleasing.

Purchase if you want more. Lighting in room is pretty dim (good for a romantic getaway though) But the entry has no lighting, which is where the closets are. They are made of dark wood so it is difficult to see in them. Dont drop anything small in there, you will lose it. Access to the bathroom is kind of difficult and there is no place in sink area to put your stuff. They need to install small sink cabinets to provide a place to set your personals. In an effort to save water, the hotel does not provide a full set of towels unless you request it. Have a handicap son. The wheel chair access through out the hotel is quite difficult. Entry on and off elevators is very challenging. There are bumps throughout hotel where the outside cement areas meet the inside carpet areas. Hard for wheel chair access.

Good sized room which was clean and comfortable. the bathroom was spacious and had good quality toiletries. The reception staff were always more than happy to give advice and help whenever we asked and the general atmosphere was relaxed, efficient and always available to help without being ingratiating. The hotel is in a good position away from the tourist trap of Fisherman's wharf but central enough to take advantage of the city. However be aware that it is in a very hilly part of the city. If you are on the fifth floor you have to take two lifts from different parts of the hotel because of the hill the hotel is on. The pool area was very well presented with towels on the sun beds although we were not able to use it. Breakfast is taken in the restaurant next door who provide a very substantial meal. No hesitation in recommending the hotel to anybody who is considering it. Lombard Street, the crookedest street in the world is in walking distance, but, is tough going because of the hills.

It's ok Mo to Th, but Fr-Sa is tough. So you pay about $30/day for unguarranteed and unguarded parking lot. The elevator doesn't work at night. And this is not for safety reason, because staircase near it is open, accessible from the street and unguarded 24 hours. No facilities near the sink in the bathroom to put cosmetics and other stuff on. Shelves in the room are uncomfortable too. Wi-Fi is complementary, but it worked for 1 day. Next day we had to call to IT support to make it work - they have to help you to connect each device separately, not like your laptop, iphone and ipad will be automatically connected once you're given the passcode! You have to be cautious about bathroom curtain because \"shower tube\" wall is about 1 inch tall and curtain easily gets out and water spills on the floor.

You aren't too far from Fisherman's Wharf and Fort Mason which has views of the Golden Gate on a clear day. Lombard St. is a few blocks down but, be forewarned that its all uphill.\n\nAnyway, we were greeted by Tony, an affable concierge, upon check-in. He was super friendly and was always ready to help with any inane touristy questions we had. We were also given complimentary continental breakfasts which, aren't much. Basically, you get fruit, muffins, sweet rolls, coffee cake, toast (toaster only toasts on one side!) and choice of beverage. If you eat like a bird, then you're sorted. If not, you can order off the menu but, I honestly didn't think the food was that great. There are plenty of quality restaurants around the corner that will delight your palette much more than this place. *coughLaBoulangecough*\n\nRooms are clean and spacious with super comfy beds.

Also since the room get's really hot during the day it magnifies the humid old carpet odor. The bedding and bathroom were always kept very clean though so I can't complain too much. It's not terrible but I have to be honest. On the bright side this hotel is in an excellent location. It's away from the noisy busy area but close enough to walk everywhere. Polk street is right behind the hotel and has a very soho-like feel to it (more laid back though). Fisherman's Wharf is about 5 minutes north of the hotel and union square is about 15 minutes. We only took the bus once to get to the mission district ($2 and 15 min ride). The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful when asking for restaurant suggestions or directions.

The room was so big I don't think they know what to do with the extra space. However, it was on the 3rd floor facing the pool. Couldn't open the windows for air and our above neighbors we think we're actually doing cart wheels, little loud due to the thin walls. Continental breakfast was good. Its located in the cafe downstairs. Staff is attentive and friendly all around. Its basic bagels, muffins, bread and fruit. Great way to start your morning.\nCouple of corks - bathroom in either room is very small, no place to set personal items down. No light in the closets so its hard to see even during the day due to the modern lighting in the room.

Very limited items, but not bad. We took a tour of San Francisco after purchasing online tickets for City by the Bay Tours (a $220 value for only $90 through Groupon).

The beds were awesome and comfy! Remodeling continues. Not such good things: Layout of the hotel makes it quite noisy. Between construction, and people walking the corridors, was loud. Tried to nap during the day....wasn't gonna happen. Lots of slamming doors. Was quiet at night, however. Room was hot...and they don't have A/C. Location isn't great. It is on the 47/49 bus line which quickly gets you to the subways, but.....there is NOTHING directly around the hotel. Thank goodness they had a place to eat for breakfast. The room remodel is ok. They are going more streamlined and modern. However, room lacks character. There are NO pictures on the wall. Upgrades were spotty. Some nice fixtures but then they went with cheaper fiberglass shower!? Need to dust on the top of closet area....yuck! Did a bedbug check...no bedbugs found! They have a pool under construction....but when is swimming weather in SF?! Anyway, it's an ok place....staff made it better. Beds were great! But, I think it's a 3 star hotel personally....and you might be better off paying a little more and staying exactly where you wanna be...in the action!

The front desk staff was a little on the curt side when I called in seeing if early check in was a possibility but when we arrived they were friendly. The free continental breakfast was nothing to write home about, but it did save us some $. The lady that oversaw the breakfast area was incredibly sweet.\n\nOur room was HUGE. There was a living room area with TV on one side then another side with the bed and another TV. You could easily fit 2 adults and 2 children here. The outdoor spa area looked like it was in need of some cleaning, there were leaves in the pool that kept increasing during the duration of our stay. There was an underground parking garage so that felt more secure, but I was a little disappointed because for some reason I thought parking would be free for hotel guests. The charge ended up being $6.95 a night though, which is cheap compared to downtown hotels.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Seattle, WA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-06-01T17:27:17Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Maria","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"808403","reviewId":"20202851","photos":[],"itinId":"364146037","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Ron","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Not a great neighborhood","reviewText":"Close to airport, reasonable price and ok for a quick overnight.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Lakewood WA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-04-22T03:52:16Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Ron","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"BusinessTravelers","categoryLabel":"BusinessTravelers"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"808403","reviewId":"20202439","photos":[],"itinId":"361448773","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"HOPE","brandType":"Expedia","title":"good hotel, ok location","reviewText":"YOU'RE BETTER OFF STAYING IN DOWNTOWN S.F.\nPRICE WAS GOOD, HOTEL GOOD, NEIGHBORHOOD NOT GOOD.

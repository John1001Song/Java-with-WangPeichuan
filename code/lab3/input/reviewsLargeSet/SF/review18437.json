The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean. The theme of the hotel is a little Pinterest-y but very fun and stylish. The lobby was under construction while I was there but it created no noise or cleanliness issues that bothered me. The biggest warning I will give about the place is that it is right on the brink of the most dangerous part of town. We walked not even a full street south to get on the bus at 8pm and passed an entire homeless camp sleeping on the street (Ellis). We didn't make it a full city block before we had police officers stop us and offer to just drive us to our destination because we were in such a dangerous part of town they said. Up until that point we had only walked north of the hotel and had not noticed anything that scary. But not even a block away is a church and many community resources so the homeless (and crime/drugs that can often accompany them) were pretty much swarming around the streets very close to the hotel.

The building is old (I believe dating from the 1920s) so it would be unfair to compare the structure to a modern edifice.  The age of the building gives it a certain charm but that patina is not without its downsides.  For instance, the elevator is tiny, the heating is vintage steam heat and if you want cool air, open a window.  But it is not run down - everything works fine.  Internet is free (and good).\r\n\r\nThe rooms were clean and well decorated.  The bed was very comfortable.  I wish there would have been a bit more storage space in the bathroom and generally more horizontal space for stuff.  Admittedly, I was in SF for a conference and had quite a bit of stuff I needed to lay out.\r\n\r\nAlthough the television was flat screen, it was only very basic cable - and the sound on one channel never did work throughout the week long stay.  This is certainly something that could and should be updated.\r\n\r\nBut the real issue with this hotel is the neighbourhood.  While the hotel is within an easy walk of Chinatown, the BART station and about 12 minutes from the Moscone Center, some of the nearby streets are definitely to be avoided.

Had to turn the radiator off because of the heat in the room initially, but with the windows open and a fan on, it became very pleasant. The walls are adorned with quotes and canvases all related to Mark Twain, and this gives the hotel a classic, intellectual feel that you wouldn't notice otherwise.\r\n\r\nHotel staff is very laid back, and the bartender at the time of this post had enormous insight into classical literature and led me through one of the most intelligent conversations I've been privy to in years. His dedication to the literature just cemented the classic feel of the hotel, and this is a perfect place to get off the grid after a long day of tourist attractions in the city. Breakfast place next door is phenomenal, and there are food and bars close by.\r\n\r\nI don't think you should expect a 5 star experience - if you're one of those people who expects to be waited on hand and foot - maybe skip the Mark Twain. But if you're someone who wants to feel welcomed to a new city, wants to knock back a drink or two in a calm environment and have a chat with the employees before going up to bed - you would be hard pressed to find a better hearth.\r\n\r\nNot a 5 star hotel, but they know that.

The shower temp also fluctuated, so that ever 20 seconds it would become scalding hot for about 2 seconds. Although this was not long enough to burn, I had to hop in and out of the water constantly to avoid the intense temperature changes. \r\n\r\nThe beds were very comfy, although I found it hard to sleep due to the thin walls / windows. Even with the windows shut I could hear everything going on outside: people yelling, cars honking, etc. A nap during the day was impossible.

The major problem we had occurred on our second night, when it sounded like someone right outside our window was screaming the entire night. We chose a room in the back of the hotel thinking that the street noise in the front might be unpleasant, but that would probably be preferable to screaming, proselytizing homeless people (the screaming was some sort of sermon).

Front desk staff are generally nice and helpful except for Baji. She was very impatient and didn't make the effort to help us. Simple question of time period of carpark charges, ie. from what time till what time, was met with repetitive \"if you park your car overnight, you'd be charged for just 1 night.\". There are cheaper parking alternatives elsewhere and we wanted to maximise the overnight parking charge. When we collected the car at 6pm, we were informed that we would still be charged for 1 night, or any additional hours that we require parking. We were stumped. If she told us that overnight carpark charges were till 2pm, regardless of whether we checked out of hotel or not, we would have retrieved our car before 2pm. To our dismay, we paid for more expensive parking when we found elsewhere that was at half the cost. This being said, we were disappointed with her service attitude.

Rooms size was good, but the bathroom is smaller than most. An open closet contained two garment rods with an in room safe that uses a physical key to lock it. Bathroom was clean, plenty of towels, and the usual provided toiletries. Sink area is very small but functions well enough. Shower height was excellent for me, I'm 6'2 and it was above me! Plenty of hot water; yet when someone else uses cold water the shower temp goes up. Room was a comfortable temperature. A ceiling fan and radiator controls additional comfort. Nothing is perfect in older hotels, so if I had to list drawbacks I would say the carpeting was very worn and dated. Walls are thinner than most so loud neighbors can be heard (yet I had no trouble in getting proper rest). Water running through pipes is louder that most.

However, I had a steam radiator in my room which made so much noise that I couldn't sleep all night. I called the desk at 4:30am and they seemed to know all about the problem, and said they would turn the hotel boiler off! Which they did, and by the time I got out of bed, the room was freezing. The second night, I discussed this with the front desk, and they were very apologetic, and turned off both the heater and the hotel boiler, so it was quiet during the night, but again, by the time I woke up in the morning, I was freezing. The third night, I left the heater on until I went to bed, but had to have the television on very loud in order to hear it over the heater. Then we went through the same process of having the boiler turned off, then turning off the heater.\nIt is crazy, and actually a bit dangerous, to have such an out of control steam heater. At one point, when I was trying to turn the heater off, it spit out boiling hot water and hit me in the face.\n\nThe hotel is a perfectly fine hotel, if it weren't for this problem.

You can really see how the church cares about its members, regardless of race, social status, or partner preference, and they are very welcoming to tourists.\n\nWould definitely have no qualms with staying here again.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Canada","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-07-21T00:56:23Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Other","categoryLabel":""}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"18437","reviewId":"18429136","photos":[],"itinId":"378028639","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"tiffany","brandType":"Expedia","title":"great location","reviewText":"Good location and comfort for the price.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"fresno, ca","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-07-12T02:39:52Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"18437","reviewId":"18428636","photos":[],"itinId":"374065682","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Paolo","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Excellent price for the location","reviewText":"-","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-07-06T01:42:09Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"18437","reviewId":"18428698","photos":[],"itinId":"373960380","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"John","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Get some Dang Bottle Openers! Oh, and be nicer too!","reviewText":"The hotel and staff were rather unhelpful in providing some very basic amenities. Not to sound like an overindulger, but I couldn't get a glass or a bottle opener for my room. I had a lovely Anchor Steam beer (brewed in SF) and had to bring it to the lobby to be opened. I also wanted a glass and was refused. A customer service minded emplyoee could have made executive decision to take care of me, but didn't. In fact, I was told that I couldn't have my glass because the adjoining restaurant might run out due to the use of my single glass! I think it is unfortunate that they don't provide this very simple and cheap amenity when asked. Also, it was like pulling teeth to get a late checkout...a grudging 30 minutes was finally provided. The star system of Expedia is a bit misleading here. I'd call it a two star with a restaurant.\nThe room was simple, clean and nice. The location is awesome (across the street from the $400 a night Hilton)! If you aren't used to street folk, the neighborhood could seem dodgy...but that is the nature of the Union Square area of SF.\nWe selected a room at the back of the hotel for quietness...our view was of an apartment building wall about eight feet away. It was quiet and very dark. If this isn't for you I'd recommend asking for a room overlooking the light well. It would be quiet too and wouldn't have perpetual twilight.\nOverall I'd recommend this hotel...for the value and location rather than for it's style and service.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Reno","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-06-25T16:26:42Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"18437","reviewId":"18429134","photos":[],"itinId":"361638259","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Vladimir","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Quite good for its price","reviewText":"Old furniture.

The current price was great considering other hotels within two blocks charge three times the price. There are issues, however. During our three day stay the elevator rarely worked (people all the way up to the 9th floor had to walk up and down). The in-room wi-fi service was horrible (to the hotel's credit, they refunded the charge when I complained). The free desktop/internet computer in the lobby worked sporadically. The rooms are clean, but the hotel is old and the bathroom, especially, could use a revamp. Charge for valet parking (for the area) is a bit less than at other hotels.

We made it into the hotel safely and were greeted by a very nice young man working the front desk. He was extremely courteous and gave us the keys to our rooms as well as some information about the things we wanted to do while in San Francisco. When we got to our room, the fun began! It was at least 85 degrees in there. You should know that it was only about 50 degrees outside so there was no reason a room should be that hot. At least we thought there was not a good reason for it until we tried to turn on the air conditioner. It could not be turned on because there wasn't one. We thought this must be a mistake. Every hotel room has some sort of air conditioning system unless it is located in a third world country right? Wrong! I went back to the friendly young man at the front desk to inquire about getting a room with an air conditioner. I was then informed there were no air conditioners in any of the rooms. He did however move us to a lower floor, and I must this room was somewhat cooler and had a ceiling fan. We were still hot, but it was tolerable. The only other complaint I have is the fact that we could hear other people doing a variety of things in their rooms.

As far as proximity goes, this hotel is within walking distance of many retail stores,drug stores, fast food joints, restaurants,etc. It is also within walking distance to trains, buses, cable cars & BART that are need to take someone directly to some of the major tourist attractions. Now there are some minor drawbacks. The elevator is so small that you & your luggage will have to go up separately. The room was neat, but small. It was good enough for my 6yr old & me, but no more than 2 adults. Don't know how much bigger it would be for triple or more. We had a nice view of a brick wall, so day or night was all the same. But if you're not going to spend much time in the room, it is just a minor annoyance. Please note: There are a lot of homeless people & panhandlers in the area & some reviewers & even the hotel will tell you to go left when exiting the hotel instead of right to avoid being harassed. But in my experience, this was not a problem. I actually had more beggars when I went \"left\" than \"right\". After the first day, I went right if I had to go right, I chose not to take the long way around. As I mentioned, I have a 6 yr. old & would not put her in harm's way intentionally.

The room was large but modest, and the bathroom and other features worked as expected. The mattress, however, may have been carved from a solid block of limestone. I did not try the hotel restaurant, but it appears to concentrate on artisan meats (the bits we Texans feed to the dogs) served in the provincial French style. I did not note much traffic going in and out, but I was seldom in the area during peak dining hours. The hotel bar was dark, quite, and seemed to be well-occupied with guests.

It's VERY centrally located, we walked EVERYWHERE in no time. Great value for the area! The bad: it's noisy. The hotel faces a busy street and there are car horns and people screaming all night. The electricity in the hotel went out twice during our stay (granted they were have their worst storm in 27 years). The radiator in the room was clanking all night. Not a very restful room. If you're a heavy sleeper and don't need all the amenities, this is place for you.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"San Diego, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-02-25T23:43:55Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"4","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_ca","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"18437","reviewId":"18428961","photos":[],"itinId":"262859487","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"4105","userNickname":"Hans","brandType":"Expedia","title":"OK Hotel","reviewText":"This is an older hotel near the gritty Tenderloin district.

SF is noisy, though my room was towards the back and therefore night-time street noise was much reduced, 6am garbage pickup was my 'alarm' clock ea day; the room had a ceiling fan and w/judicious use of the window, easily regulated my room temps (once I found out the windows DID open!). Staff were superlative--and that goes a long way! Beds were a bit hard and the outdoor night life is pretty wild, but both the doorman and the concierge are very vigilant and all will help you out however you might need. Four Starbucks within 2 blocks! Excellent location to sightseeing, transportation, shopping, and city center. Offbeat style but I felt very 'at-home' and safe.

It is also in close proximity to Bloomingdales, Westfield Centre, and all high end stores. Service. 1) I called the hotel in advance to ask how much an airport shuttle would cost me, their quote was off by $5. 2) I had to call down to the front desk to ask them to activate my phone so I could make outside calls. Should have been done at check-in. 3) An information sheet explaining hotel services and costs (internet costs were my only concern) was out of date. Not a big deal,but come on. They did provide tourist maps and booklets, and those proved to be very helpful in planning out my days and routes. The Room. Bed and pillows were comfortable. I booked a single Queen, got two doubles. I did not complain. Linens were nice and the room was clean. I did not find the room to be too small, but I was a single traveller, this may have been the difference.

The clerk had coded and rented the room to someone else knowing that it was occupied! The hotel is a beautiful old hotel but it is on the edge of the Tenderloin District and not safe at night, as well as being next to the homeless shelter. There is no parking on the premises and no continental breakfast. Also, the custodial staff did not pay attention to the signs that said to save water and cleanning costs...not to replace towels that were hung.

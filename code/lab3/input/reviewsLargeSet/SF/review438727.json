On one day as we were leaving the parking lot Janmesh ran outside to give us a box of See's chocolate to give to our Daughter in law. I have traveled extensively in several countries and I can honestly say that I have never been given this type of positive personal attention.

All of the restaurants near by are sit-down (IHOP, Dennys, Red Robins) and couldn't find drive-thru fast food places which would have been convenient when you're trying to catch a flight. Free wi-fi internet access, but no LAN access. Login & password are listed in the room, so you don't have to call the front desk. Lots of cable channels (80 with local), including Food Network, Discovery Channel & Animal Planet.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Los Angeles, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2006-11-22T20:54:19Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]}]}}}

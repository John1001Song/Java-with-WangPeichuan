It took several conversations before they agreed to move us into the room we actually paid for. The new room was more spacious and updated. Overall, we found the staff to be unfriendly and not overly helpful but the rooms were adequate. Decent hotel if you can get one of the good rooms for the right price.

The rooms are very nice however even though this is a historic hotel the hallways especially where the bedrooms are situated are very tired and also there is a funny unkempt smell. Staff were very helpful but parking is very expensive. I would use the parking garage round the corner which for overnight is $35 cheaper , 24 hours and secured parking and just literally a 2 minute walk round the corner to the hotel. It is the Hertz rental /car return place and in the same road as Loris diner.\r\nThe rooms are modern in terms of beds and TV's but the rest not so much. There are rooms that dont have a view and are larger than those that do. Noise wasn;t an issue as although we have kids they are used to noise and you don't come to San Francisco to go to bed at 8pm.

However, if you expect any type of customer service from the females working behind the front desk (the male employees there were always helpful, polite and courteous), then think again and take your custom elsewhere to the many other hotels in the area charging the same price and sharing the same great location. We experienced terrible difficulty towards the end of our stay, following a wonderful holiday, trying to arrange a late check out as our flight was not until 9pm. We understand that a late check out can never be guaranteed but we were lied to by the female front desk staff about the situation and offered no alternatives - we challenged their initial claim that the hotel was full after finding all room types advertised online as available, and only then did they admit that actually they were not full but would not give us a late check out (advertised as a service you could pay for in the hotel room guest book) because the cleaners did not stay past 3pm and it would be too inconvenient; only then were we offered shower facilities to use before our flight home instead.

It's also 1/2 a block away from Union Square where we were able to pick-up one of the hop on hop off tour buses that took us all over SF.  There's a good restaurant attached to the hotel and the menu and price were fairly reasonable. The beds were very comfortable with high thread count bedding.  The room itself is fairly big and we were able to chill comfortably.  The not-so good things were the small bathroom; especially the shower.  It's positioned in a diagonal and the shower head is facing out so the water was most likely going to leak out on to the bathroom floor until you get in the shower which blocked the water from leaking but boy is it tight in there!  (Beware the shower shelf or else you'll hit your elbow or head on it!)  There was also a device above one of the beds that circulates the air but unfortunately it also generated a lot of dust.  I was wondering how come my phone on the side table was constantly covered in dust in the morning and my allergies acted up indoors when it was so rainy outside.

My husband and I stayed here 2 nights while in San Francisco.  It was clean and comfortable but nothing fancy.   I felt it was overpriced, and the parking fee was terrible at $52 per night.  When we checked in, we were told that our room was accessed from the garage entry on the backside of the same block.  It wasn't a major inconvenience although I did think it was peculiar that it wasn't connected and there was no way for us to get to it without walking around the block.  We had the first room near the elevators and could hear people talking loudly outside our door while waiting for or getting off the elevator.  It wasn't enough of an issue to request a different room, but it was a small annoyance.  The plumbing was also strangely loud - we would hear loud noises from our own toilet each time someone else (above us, or through the wall?) flushed.  So I kept the bathroom door shut so it wouldn't bother us.  The second morning of our stay we were woken up by construction workers jackhammering the street right outside.  I know this one is not the hotel's fault, however when added to the other things mentioned, it did contribute to our conclusion that we think we will look for a different hotel next time we visit San Francisco.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"central location","negativeRemarks":"Noise levels.","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"K","userLocation":"Missouri","reviewSubmissionTime":"2015-09-08T15:31:43Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"6666","reviewId":"55edff07b545f708f00abda4","photos":[],"itinId":"1109110590860","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"MMA","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":2,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"dbind1","brandType":"Expedia","title":"bathroom very small can't even turn around\r\n","reviewText":"charge for use computers to print airplane passes\r\nno coffee only water not even all day\r\nLobby very old furniture not pleasant\r\n","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"location","negativeRemarks":" free coffee \r\nfree use of computers  \r\nupdated furniture/dressers in rooms\r\nHandicap \r\nbetter equipment in work out area","locationRemarks":"food in area very tourist high prices for quality offered","lastInitial":"B","userLocation":"Boston","reviewSubmissionTime":"2015-09-07T21:17:59Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"4","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_ca","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"6666","reviewId":"55ec5d0fa239bb08f2110563","photos":[],"itinId":"1109146769562","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"HMP MMD","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"4105","userNickname":"Mrs. D.","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Close to Transit","reviewText":"Our room was small but clean and comfortable.

I had to figure out my room's quirky electrical to get the TV to work, which, by the way, is also on the smaller side. Once it worked, the cable signal was spotty.

It is a very functional hotel with friendly service and good attention to detail.  The rooms are cleaned promptly as soon as guests are out and they provide adequate comfort and amenities for the price point.  The beds are comfortable, the rooms are large enough for two people and the staff is responsive to all needs of the guests.  The free wifi is slow and erratic, but at least it is not charged ala carte anymore.  The Cable TV package is better than other area hotels and provide major channels and coverage of SF Giants baseball.  I am also pleased that a restaurant has been added, though I find the choice of music a little loud and off-putting to me, so I tend to eat next door at Lefty O'Doul's which is adequate for a quick breakfast.  For me, the Handlery is probably close to an ideal middle class hotel without pretensions to the luxury category, but much better than many nearby alternatives which are pushing the price envelope relative to their value these days.  I would happily recommend the hotel and its perfect location on Union Square to all visitors to San Francisco.

The beds were very comfortable and the pillows to our liking. We had a large vanity area which was helpful for 2 women getting dressed, the only feature lacking was a towel bar for hand towels. We ended up putting the towels over the wall mounted magnifying mirror. Thank you for having 2 makeup mirrors in the room!!! The problem with the room was the really bad odor, which I can only describe as stinky shoes and socks, but perhaps dog?! This seems to be a common complaint at The Handlery. We did go out and purchase a room deodorizer, which coupled with opening the sliding door for periods of time helped a bit.

It is an older building, but clean and well maintained. The staff was friendly and helpful. Internet was included. It is located 1/2 block from Union Square on Geary at Powell St. It is 2 blocks to Market St and the BART station and a 12 min walk to the Moscone Center. The location was perfect for me. There was a Daily Grill right next door and many restaurants within walking distance. I had a terrific stay and would return the next time I am in San Francisco.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"Nice sized room, comfortable bed, great staff (and cleaning people), great TV, location and FREE internet.","negativeRemarks":"Nothing","locationRemarks":"Good restaurants, shopping and nearby BART station can get you to just about anywhere in the Bay Area.","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Newport Beach, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2013-10-20T18:39:51Z","roomTypeId":11352,"userDisplayName":"Bob","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"25","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_au","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"6666","reviewId":"59762875","photos":[],"itinId":"11367244757","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"3081","userNickname":"rika","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great location , close to union square antransport","reviewText":"We extended our stay and the reception and back office worked hard to ensure we didn't have to move rooms .

But at least we weren't charged for rollaway. But room very comfortable and clean, and well serviced. Check price of parking before you stay, we didn't and got a shock with the price! But we were staying very central so worth the price. Great location. Pub next door great for breakfast.

When my first choice (The Orchard) didn't fall within my budget, I decided to return to the Handlery.\n\nFirst, you can't beat the location. It's on Geary just off of Powell, so you have good access to cable cars (NEVER call them trolleys!), buses, shopping, taxis, and restaurants of every stripe. Chinatown is a few blocks away and you can walk to North Beach and even the Wharf if you are ambitious.\n\nSecond, the staff is gracious and pleasant. There were a few hiccups (my feather free room still had the down comforter on the bed when I arrived, and I had a devil of a time trying to get a knife so that I could slice some cheese when I wanted to have dinner in my room one night) but the room was clean and the front desk staff very helpful.\n\nMy chief complaint--and it's big-- was my bathroom. I had stayed here before so I knew the room was small, and in many old fashioned hotels the bathrooms are not very big, but THIS WAS OUTRAGEOUS. The shower was so small I could not turn around under the water without being up against the curtain. I do not see how an average sized adult male could shower in there.\n\nFor a 5 night stay, this was VERY uncomfortable. 3/4 baths are NOT mentioned on their website.

Just by chance we met Mr. Handlery upon our arrival and our departure. A true gentleman. This hotel is very clean and the staff are very helpful. The location is outstanding. The cable cars are just down the block. We bought a $27 Muni pass that's goos for 7 days. On our last day we gave it to another couple who has just arrived so they had three free days of travelling with it. We used it for the cable cars, the 'F' train and the regular transit buses. Normally a cable car is $6 one way per person. Lefty O'Douls is next door to the hotel and is very economical and delicious food. Had our breakfasts there every morning and supper once. Be sure to do Alcatraz, Chinatown and walk the Golden Gate Bridge (about a 40 minute walk one way). The transit buses will take you right there (#38L and then transfer to #28). Found ourselves at Fisherman's Wharf 3 of the 4 days. For a great seafood supper at the Wharf, go to Scomas. Chinatown is a 15 minute walk from the hotel. Don't catch the cable car at the final stop. The lineups are very long....walk to the first stop a block away and you'll likely get on right away. Lombard Street is about a block or 2 before the Wharf. The cable car goes right by it. Do the walk up or down the street. We were quite exhausted after 4 days but managed to see everyhting we wanted.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Edmonton, Canada","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-08-10T22:33:44Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"4","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_ca","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"6666","reviewId":"19283879","photos":[],"itinId":"375136884","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"4105","userNickname":"Jean","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Nice place!","reviewText":"However, internet connection should be free of charge","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Montréal, QC","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-08-09T23:34:35Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Families","categoryLabel":"Families"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"25","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_au","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"6666","reviewId":"19283752","photos":[],"itinId":"2269282","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"3081","userNickname":"Stephen","brandType":"Expedia","title":"In the heart of San Francisco","reviewText":"The Handlery Hotel is centrally located with easy access to all major landmarks.

We found the hotel front desk very welcoming and helpful and they were really obliging with moving us to a new room when we found our original room very noisy. If you are seeking a quiet room I suggest you request a room in the newer part of the hotel and facing the pool (as opposed to the street). While in this newer section of the hotel, our first room faced onto the very busy Geary Street and was also right next to the lifts and vending machines.\n\nThe hotel location can't be faulted - it's just a few steps to Union Square and all the shopping/theatre district, and many other San Fran attractions/neighbourhoods are in walking distance.\n\nThe hotel itself is looking a little worn now. The original part of the hotel is very old (I can't comment on the rooms as we didn't stay in this section)and even the so-described 'new' section would have been built in the sixties or seventies. The two rooms we had were extremely clean and comfortable - but just a bit tired - little things like leaking toilet cistern and slightly worn carpet. I may just be being picky, but if you're expecting upper end quality, you may be a bit disappointed.\n\nOverall, however, I would recommend this hotel for a clean room at relatively reasonble cost in a handy location.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Wellington, New Zealand","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-01-18T22:25:16Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Lesley","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Families","categoryLabel":"Families"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"6666","reviewId":"19283692","photos":[],"itinId":"350653704","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Chris","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great Location, but noisy and uncomfortabe.","reviewText":"Hotel is in great location to shops and restaurants, but the rooms are noisy and the beds are very uncomfortable.

The room was small, our windows faced other room windows-not so happy about that, but the natural lighting that entered our room was fantastic. If you didnt keep your blinds shut (including in the bathroom) another guest across could easily see you. Decor did a good job of making the room look contemporary/modern, as long as the squeaking wood floors didnt bother you as you walked down the hallways of the hotel.Did see the pool-small, but heated-seemed to be a fav of guest's kids. Loved the fact that there is a restaurant-\"The Daily Grill\" connected to the hotel (you will get room service from here)-just a few feet from the lobby. Seemed to be a popular spot for locals and guests since it was never really empty. And probably the best thing that could be said about this hotel is its LOCATION-right next to Union Square-lots and lots of stores to shop, easy access to public transportation, and easy to get a cab-even though I was told by the bell man that some cabs will refuse local service (they prefer trips to the airport)-the taxi drivers were a bit \"rough\" with their driving.

The worker was not at all accommodating and treated me as if I was wasting his time. Later that night (while dressed up), I decided to ask again, but this time the front desk Manager was working and he told me that I did not have to wait until the next day and that he could get me in a king room that moment. Well, this was the exact opposite of what the other worker had told me earlier. When I moved into the other room that night, it was a huge suite and was beautiful! Other issues: the bell staff did not offer to help me with my many bags during checkin. The bathrooms were never cleaned properly. When I checked in, shaved stubble was all over the sink and the cleaning never got better. The room was always cold, even though the heater went up to a max of 74. Do not get a room on the 2nd floor if you are a light sleeper, it was so loud! However, a room with a view on 4th floor was much better (even though the garbage trucks woke me up around 1am and did not stop until 2:30am).

Great Location just off Union Square. Some refurbishment works taking place between the older part of the hotel and the newer complex. We stayed in the older part and were given a room overlooking Geary Street. Room was OK but not too much space. Main point to note was the street music (I use this term loosely as it was often no more than plastic containers being used as drums!) being played from about 7pm to 10pm each night. Be aware that if you are located at the front of the hotel it is very noisy during these times. Surprised how many homeless people there were in the area (much bigger problem than other American cities we have stayed in such as NY). Main Restaurant attached to the hotel is excellent for evening meals, although you may need to make a reservation. Would recommend Breakfast at 'Lefty O'Douls' restaurant/bar which is located next door to the hotel. In summary we had a great time and loved San Franciscio.

When we arrived at 10 am (check - in @ 3), we were ushered directly into our up-graded room, no wait, just a warm welcome from the wonderful & competent staff. The room overlooked the street that ran in front of the hotel, but we though it was just a very local flavor. We stayed for 5 nights and not once were we interupted by housekeeping or any other member of the staff. The front desk and concierge were top-notch and went above and beyond, and the restaurant was a delicious perk. This hotel is in proximity to anything you could possibly want-cablecar, bus, trolley, rental car offices, bart, etc.... We would definitely recommend this to anyone staying in the area.

The bathroom was small, but comfortable, and the room was the perfect size for two. We booked a single full bed, but were happily surprised when we were given two double beds. The view wasn't great, but the price couldn't be beat, so we weren't complaining. Overall, the Handlery is very affordable and pleasant. The location is ideal, situated right on Union Square and close to the Bart station and the F car. It's very close to SOMA and the Financial District and short steetcar ride away from more touristy areas like Fisherman's Wharf.

For the bad, we had chosen the Handlery because, unlike many other properties, they indicated that it was probable that we could get a smoking room--no promises but said that it was likely. When we arrived the clerk said none were available and wouldn't check to see if there would be any later or even the next day. He was pleasant and friendly but it was just no--deal with it. Also, we needed some internet access which was allegedly available but after messing with it for 3 or 4 days and being given a runaround by the front desk people, it became obvious that the hotel's internet service wasn't working. We finally went to a little copy shop right outside the hotel's garage entrance and got most of what we needed taken care of.

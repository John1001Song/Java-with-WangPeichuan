Very close to Market Street where you find many buses and trolley cars. Close walk to cable cars. Less than 2 blocks is the Powell stop for BART...great connection to and from airport. I recommend buying a Clipper Pass for ease in using transportation...available at airport and Walgreen drugstores. Dining places are to be had throughout the neighborhood.  The hotel has quite an adequate breakfast room, serving from 6 to 10 am daily and staffed with exceptionally friendly staff members.  Some reviews noted many homeless in this neighborhood. Yes, there are some homeless around; however, I was never bothered by any of them coming and going at the hotel which is quite secure.  Much of downtown SF has a homeless issue; it's just part of the local color. Didn't have a good meal in SF.............avoid the Big 4 on Nob Hill....mediocre food at elevated prices and attitude-soaked waiters. Food at Hotel Zetta...less than mediocre at inflated prices coupled with thick attitude.

It was a great choice. We were driving to San Francisco from Southern California. We stayed in the \"Grand Suite\". It had a separate bedroom with two double beds and a pull out couch in the living room. The bathroom was large. There was a full little kitchen (stove top, microwave, dishwasher, full size fridge, coffee maker). There was a big dining table with swivel chairs. I guess for business people they could use the room to have meetings. There was a white board behind a wood frame/cover on the wall. The kids loved it!  There was a TV in the living room and the bedroom. My only complaint is that there wasn't a fan/air-conditioner&heater in the bedroom and so the room could get stuffy. Having a fan in the room also helps to block out incidental noise from the other rooms and so we could hear footsteps, children running around upstairs, etc. Other than that, the room was very great. The breakfast is decent. Nothing hot, but lots of cereals, bagels, pastries, toast, fruit, yogurt, juice, coffee, tea, and hard boiled eggs on two of the days we were there. Be warned - The breakfast is only from 6-9 Monday - Friday so if you have a big crew to wake up and get ready you might want to send someone down and bring up breakfast for everyone. The hotel always has water, coffee and tea available, as well as apples and chocolate chip cookies in the afternoon. San Francisco is only 10 min. away by car.

My wife wanted to steal one of the pillows she liked it so much and we had a restful night's sleep virtually every night.  Guests were, by and large, quiet and well behaved as well, not a lot of \"riffraff\", such as tend to patronize other competitively priced hotels. Otherwise, this was a fairly basic, no frills hotel--which is exactly what I like.  I don't want to pay for or otherwise subsidize a lot of amenities that I won't use while on vacation.  However, as a fitness enthusiast, I was disappointed by the size and offerings in their fitness center.  Just a few light free weights and a couple treadmills as I recall, all in a stuffy little room.  If you're desperate and motivated, I guess it's better than nothing.  I got a fairly reasonable rate through Expedia, which made the stay there very competitively priced for the locale.\r\n\r\nIt is located close to and just north of SFO and right off Hwy 101, so quick access to the City (traffic notwithstanding) and in an otherwise quiet, business neighborhood--so seemingly fairly safe.

The room needed a little extra attention tho. There was a nasty wax covered q-tip on the bathroom floor. The toilet paper roll was almost empty. In the kitchen the paper towel roll was almost empty and there's no ice or sodas on the second floor. They will shop for groceries for you for free if you have your order in by 10am ... and it will be there by the evening. I thought that was cool.

We got a standard king and there was a mini kitchen, office and couch space which was entirely separate from the bedroom which is the \"all suite\" part of the location. However, I had specifically requested the highest floor, in hopes there would be a view. The hotel staff confirmed the 4th floor was what had been requested during booking and then told me it wouldn't be available unless I didn't mind the wet paint in the room. Mind you, I marked on that same request that I would be arriving at 6 pm NOT 3 pm normal check in, so they had time to take care of this. Surely it wasn't an issue, I simply took a different room...but that wasn't the point. I was pleased with the size of the room and the cleanliness as well as how many towels, soap etc. were in the room for use. However, again a bit disappointed when I changed into my bathing suit to visit there \"spa\"... 1st of all, the water was about the outside temperature (70), if we were lucky maybe 5 degrees higher. The button used to turn the jets on wasn't working and obviously the heater wasn't either, but there was no sign in sight about it being broken or anyone telling us this when we expressed we were excited to check out the spa...Walked back up to the room to call it a night and turned on the shower... the shower had some obnoxious noise coming from it the hole time like there was air in the pipes.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"Staff were friendly, free fresh baked cookies was a plus.

They have a actually really good breakfast selection, which we found so many people complained about on expedia, but we stocked up with no hassle. Yes, there is only one table to sit at and eat breakfast, but seriously people, its a hotel not a restaurant. There is a iHop just a few blocks away, and tons of resturaunts. We had a DVD player in the room that didn't work either, but after telling the front desk staff they had someone fix it immediately which was awesome.

The room was clean and there was plenty of room to move around.  I was there for only one night; but for longer stays the full kitchen is a very nice feature (which I understand is in every room).  The room was a bit warm and stuffy when I checked in (probably because the windows in my room faced West), so I did have to turn the air conditioner on; but I had to turn it to a very low temperature (65) in order to kick on and stay on.\r\n\r\nI agree with other reviewers regarding the breakfast.  It does get a bit crowded at peak times and there really is no room to sit down in the area as there is only one table, a couch and a couple of chairs.  Knowing this in advance, I planned in advanced to take my bagel and tea back to my room.

It kept getting jammed.. Not a real big issue.. Also, if comfy pillows are a must for you, I recommend to bring your own. Their pillows have no fluff what so ever and has those plastic linings so you can hear it swoosh everytime you move. Those are the only cons I have about the hotel. So what was I impressed about?? We planned on driving to the city to the nike expo, but I was a bit hesitant when we found out there was major traffic due to Bart being on strike.

The hotel has planted trees outside of the windows to try to hide the industrial park it abuts, and the continental breakfast was a bit limited, but complimentary.

There was no view in the front, back or side of the hotel. I guess that was expected considering it was an airport hotel. BUT when I entered the lobby, I was greeted by one of the most professional front desk attendants I've ever encountered (Mike). He made me feel right at home. Check in was easy and quick and before I knew it I was in my room. The room was clean, quaint, and very comfortable. The air condition was already on for me, which was a nice touch. There was also a full kitchen with the works. The bathroom was amazing, and the complimentary toiletries smelled great. The living space was most comfortable and the huge flat screen TV was an added bonus. Breakfast is complimentary and it superceded anything I've ever had in a US hotel. With the great rooms and awesome complimentary breakfast, I would definitely stay again, just not in room 231. I was annoyed by the noise that came from the room above. I'm not sure if there were hardwood floors in the room, or if the person had heavy feet, but he/she sounded as if they were stomping when walking. Luckily they turned in early every night, but boy was it loud. Overall, this hotel was a great find and I will definitely stay again. Thanks Larkspur Landing.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"North Hollywood, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-09-09T16:37:37Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"287665","reviewId":"17918925","photos":[],"itinId":"290400154","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Lori","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Will Stay Again!","reviewText":"Great rooms, comfy bed, big screen TV, very quiet...what more can you ask?","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Penn Valley, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-09-07T18:07:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Lulu","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"287665","reviewId":"17918806","photos":[],"itinId":"289795329","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Michael","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Wonderful Place to Stay!","reviewText":"I was impressed with the staff person who checked me in.

The hotel is located 3 miles from the SFO airport so it's convenient. Breakfast has decent variety and choices. I noticed that there is a free shuttle from the airport however I rented a car. There is a great park 1 mile away Oyster Point, with parking and beautiful view of SF bay and airport from far away. I even saw a seal while jogging there. The location is in a \"corporate park\" setting, Unisys, Amgen, Elan business headquarter buildings within vicinity. However grocery stores, restaurants, and obviuosly beatiful downtown SF are not within a walking distance, so to enjoy the seclusion of this hotel but having quick access onto highway, I recommend renting a car.

The bed was the most comfortable we have ever slept on - they even had a pillow menu (which we didn't use since the 6 on the bed were perfect)! The Bath and Body Works toiletries were a nice touch.

The days that followed were equally as nice with an incredibly attentive staff, a spotless room (and most importantly a spotless bathroom), plush towels, and an incredibly comfortable bed. No skimping on the delicious L'Occitane soaps, shower gels and hair care products either! On our final night we decided to dine in at MKT instead of venturing out. The restaurant is closed on Sunday, but you can still order off the menu in the hotel lounge, which we did. The vibe of the lounge is amazing.

First I didn't like having to take two elevators but having the lobby on the 5th floor of the building is actually quite nice in the way that the lobby feels like a lounge for hotel guests only. In the morning, you can find coffee, tea, mini muffins, and a latte/cappuccino/hot chocolate machine at a self-service bar in the lobby. In the afternoon, they provide lemonade (at least on the day that we checked in).\n\nService was absolutely phenomenal from check-in to check-out. Our room was cleaned twice a day with towels AND bathrobes changed, and toiletries replaced. Everyone was extremely helpful without being overbearing. I was particularly impressed with the efforts the hotel made to ensure that their guests stayed informed - e.g. a printed card suggested that we leave extra time between 7:30am-9am and 5:30pm-7:30pm catch a cab, and a printout was left under our door detailing upcoming street closures for the Giants parade that scheduled to go right in front of the hotel.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"attention to detail","negativeRemarks":"price","locationRemarks":"perfect for shopping","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2012-11-01T18:25:33Z","roomTypeId":200162489,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"791769","reviewId":"39334901","photos":[],"itinId":"149593903440","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Four Seasons Five Stars","reviewText":"Terrific hotel.

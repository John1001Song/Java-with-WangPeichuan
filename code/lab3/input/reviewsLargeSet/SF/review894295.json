It was so loud sometimes it sounded like they were going to come through the walls. During the night they take-off and land over the bay, so noise wasnt to bad at night. It wasn't a big deal since we were gone during the day. The hotel wasnt close to restaurants, entailed a little bit of a drive. The mall with everything was down the road about 4-5 miles, not really walking distance. The rooms were nice and clean, nice beds. The bathroom on the other hand was a little gross. While taking a shower I noticed mold. Little patches on the white caulk in between the grantie walls, it was a little dis-heartening. Very good access to the freeway next to 101 and I-280 or I-380 (cant remember which one). The purpose of the trip was to do the Peir 39 tourist thing and go to the Zoo with 2 boys and my wife. It took about 12-15 min to get to both locations, depending on traffic. Parking at the hotel could of been an issue if it was busy. There are only maybe 15 parking spots, so if you came in late at night you had to double park behind another vehicle, then give your keys to the front desk. I didnt really like that idea.

Comfort Inns have always been one of our favorite places to stay for cost and amenities. The staff was very friendly and helpful! The room we reserved was exactly what we requested.\n\nDownsides - I wish it had been mentioned that ALL parking was in an underground parking garage. We have a very large 4X4 truck that is about 7' tall and some covered parking is hard for us to get in to. We had to make sure we were back at the hotel no later than 6pm to make sure there was enough room for us to get in and park. Granted not everyone has a big truck, but love is in the details. :)\n\nAlso there are not places close (walking distance) to get something to eat. So you have to drive about 3 miles to get to a restaurant or fast food place. This combined with a lot of construction going on in the area can be very tricky navigating.\n\nUp Side - Front desk staff is WONDERFUL! Not so much house cleaning. Not that the room wasn't clean, it was, but they took our soap and didn't replace the soap. They also didn't give us a new ice bucket bag, or coffee and the missed one trashcan to be emptied. Of course the one with left over pizza. The hotel is very close to the airport and a main street so noise could be an issue. However our room had a \"white noise\" machine which I thought was great.

The hotel was neat and clean. The desk clerk \"Neel\" was very helpful, we arrived prior to check-in time. Neel found us a room that was ready and placed us in it. He also answered all my questions and gave me directions to Fisherman's Wharf. Breakfast was very good. My family members utilized the exercise room.

I'm not someone who cares much about ambiance, but the lobby in this place felt like something that should be rented by the hour. The neighborhood is not good which generally should not matter except that the parking lot is so small that it occasionally fills up and you end up having to park on the street. That happened with me and I spent about 15 minutes trying to find a well-lit area to park. I also saw two young men being arrested in the hotel parking lot, although I don't believe they were hotel guests. It appeared to be a traffic stop, but considering the neighborhood it was not surprising. Breakfast was also below par, and I have had the exact same breakfast at another Comfort Inn but thought it was much better. There are many other chain hotel options in the area, and I would definitely stay out by the airport if I were going to SF again. Hotels are cheaper and parking is free. We used our rental car quite a bit and really enjoyed vsiting Napa Valley, Sausalito, and Carmel about 2.5 hours south. If you drive into the city bring lots of change, you only get 6 minutes per quarter. There is another Comfort Inn only about 1-2 miles away, I believe listed as South SF, that looked much nicer. We went there by accident our first night. On a positive note, the room was fine except for shower pressure which was very weak.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Arlington VA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-10-26T02:37:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"3","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_gb","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"894295","reviewId":"20659833","photos":[],"itinId":"17889427","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"2057","userNickname":"Sheila","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Would go back","reviewText":"would stay again if ever in San Francisco area","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Wirral","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-10-02T20:03:42Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"894295","reviewId":"20659825","photos":[],"itinId":"249441537","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Sangvk","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Best Hotel Stay","reviewText":"We stayed at Comfort Inn and Suites, San Bruno for the SFO 4 Nights Vacation and I have all but only good things to say about our stay. First thing is it is right next to the SFO Air Port ( like 5 - 10 minute drive) , we arrived late by 11:30 PM or so in the night , had a slight problem identifying the route , once we got the GPS out it was piece of cake and the front desk was very friendly even at that odd time. They provide free breakfast which is though nothing special it was a wonderful way to start your busy event packed day (cereals, muffins, eggs, orange juice, and coffee/tea). The SFO downtown is close to 20 Miles but it was not an issue for us, one can get to the US 101 in couple of minutes and it is a straight drive from that point. Not much traffic (though there were stop and go periods). As far as the Condition and maintenance including room service it was great. I saw few reviews saying the noise from planes from near by Airport is sometimes too much, but believe me I did not hear any in our first floor ( may be two tired from all the day trips!) (BTW our room was facing the road...). Also I read that the area was not that great, but again I did not feel a thing. Ok with all the positives I need to add a negative, yes its the GAS Price in and around San Bruno...its costlier than SFO downtown! Enough said! Overall a wonderful, unforgettable stay and I highly recommend this place for a SFO trip.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"St Louis MO","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-10-02T03:24:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"894295","reviewId":"20659805","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"David","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Comfortable and clean","reviewText":"Staff was helpful and courteous.

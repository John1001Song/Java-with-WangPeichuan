I was very pleased that they had a good beer on tap and breakfast was fast and the service very good on Sunday morning around 8 am with very few guests. Too bad it was raining since I would have loved to take a run along the walking/bike path along the shore. There is a path on both sides of the hotel which sits between the bay and a slough.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"gym and beer on tap","negativeRemarks":"only one sink in bath","locationRemarks":"nice location by walking paths, close to airport but quiet","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Bay Area","reviewSubmissionTime":"2012-03-28T03:06:25Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Birgit","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"hotelId":"519729","reviewId":"27013464","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Traveler","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Clean, comfy bargain.","reviewText":"Great location if you know your way...Burlingame is a gem and the city is 15 min. away.

If you are loud and like privacy, you might not love it, though, because you can kind of hear stuff in other spaces (just like in a normal old house). The gardens are beautiful and spacious with lots of separate lounging areas. There's a nice hot tub in a covered gazebo outside. There's a spiral staircase on the third floor that goes to a rooftop access with tables, chairs, and 360 view of city. They only charge $2 for sodas and bottled water (honor system!), and offer coffee/tea all day and free sherry and port for customers in the lobby.

Bed in my room seemed to balloon in the centre and shower was tricky to get hot-cold balance right. Friendly staff, great ambience, lots of good magazines and newspapers, rooftop deck and view is wonderful. Corn quiche at breakfast was nice but coffee was so-so. Recommended.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-09-19T07:50:02Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":3,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":3,"hotelId":"1145267","reviewId":"20525149","photos":[],"itinId":"306765537","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"A & C","brandType":"Expedia","title":"SF Oasis in the Mission","reviewText":"The hospitality of the staff & owner was excellent.

We liked the variety offered at breakfast time & the option to enjoy breakfast in our rooms.

The hotel itself was full of character, a treasure trove of antiques, the garden was beautiful and they have a roof terrace with an amazing view of the whole city. The bedrooms were decorated indivdually, really quirky...It felt like we were staying at a friends home rather than a hotel. The only down point was the size of the 'cozy' room - it's very cozy! I wouldn't book the cozy room again if I returned. The location was great - the Mission district has lots of good places to hang out...Valencia was a really good street for vintage shopping.

Very close to the BART and public bus, and an interesting neighborhood that I never found uncomfortable. The hotel was a great find for being so unique and laid-back, and the interior decor is incredible. I wish it had a larger television and better WIFI (I had to use my computer in the first floor drawing rooms--but there are worse inconveniences in life). Very affordable, great breakfast.

They do a very thorough job of cleaning,some things are old and worn and should be replace but overall was very well taken care of. Fresh flowers abound daily! The sitting room is jam packed full of daily newspapers and books on the history of san francisco and area attractions. Breakfast is fresh and fantastic everyday!Awoke to the smell of fresh brewed coffee everyday.Huge variety of fresh fruits,pastries,quiche and juices. The neighborhood is not all that great but i never had any problems and i never felt unsafe.

The building, hotel room and décor are dated, but I found the room neat, orderly, and clean.  The bed was great--perfect combination of softness and firmness.  And the sheets were over-the-top soft.  My two nights of sleep were exceptionally pleasant there.  \r\n\r\nThe two disappointments were the staff and bathroom linen.  \r\nSTAFF:The gentleman that checked me in was nice enough.  It was a late night check in and he processed me very quickly and I was off to my room.  However, the woman at the front desk the next morning appeared to be uninterested in anything going on with the guests.  She appeared to be surfing the web--her eyes were glued to the computer screen, short of when you said something to distract her.  Although she was not mean or curt, she just seemed distracted.  \r\n\r\nLINEN:  I'm not picky on the type of linen I get.  I understand how it goes--linen is costly and hotels can only afford so much.  However, my whole stock of wash clothes were like old rags you save to was your care.  All was worn out--just seemed old.  The part that really disappointed was that one of the rags looked so stained, that it really should have been thrown away.  The rest weren't that much better.

Once we arrived, however, we saw several other similar hotels on the same street which looked to be better maintained.  We did enjoy the free parking and proximity to bus lines.  We never felt unsafe.  A few things we did not enjoy:  The hotel room door doesn't open all the way because it hits the bed.  We had to plunge our own toilet twice.  The ice machine was located just outside our room, and all 4 nights people were using it between 2 am and 4 am.   Someone vomited in an empty planter overnight and it remained there for days.  The free breakfast was in such a tiny location that we did not even attempt it.  We did see people coming out with prepackaged danish pastries (think 7-11).

The bathrooms were actually decent with granite flooring and a white, clean looking tub, the place wasn't dirty, just cheap looking, The toilet paper was thin one-ply and we only had a half a roll to use for the entire stay.

I think the value was very fair for the downtown area. Room had all one needed: bed, bath, plenty of closet and drawer space, TV with (I guess) about 60 channels, coffee maker, iron, two armchairs, etc. All rooms are up one or two flights of stairs, motel style. I asked for and got a room on the lower floor. Continental breakfast, cereal, toast, waffles, coffee/tea, juice, was included. Hotel was quiet, despite what I read in reviews on Net! Lombard Street is busy and noisy, but hotel rooms are in wings running back from street and opening on courtyard, so road noise is not heard in room. No noisy parties either, so had quiet comfortable stay. The building looks older, but the bathroom (bath/shower and john) and sink area (in bedroom) were much newer and in good shape. Owners stored my baggage for me after checkout ( I had an evening departure) and called a cab for me. Bus on Chestnut Street one block away goes very close to Fisherman's Wharf; other buses on Fillmore, 1 1/2 blocks away. About four restaurants within a block; many restaurants and eateries within a few blocks. Convenience store 1/2 block away.\n\nThis isn't a Sheraton or Hilton, but it was comfortable and convenient. One quibble: the room was overall clean but the daily cleaning a bit short; carpet not vacuumed every day, but every other day (I think).

The biggest issue we had during our stay was the lack of sleep due to the continuous noise. Be prepared to hear vehicle noise particularly if your unit is more towards the street which doesnt die down until around 1.00 am and starts up again around 6.00 am. The hotel has an open centre concept allowing for the road noise to go over the building and back in sounding like a hurricane wind. Around 1.00 am to 3.00 am you get to hear yelling drunk people coming back from bars or parties and around 5.00 am you will hear the first guests leaving their rooms. The tiles throughout and the stairs (no elevators) ensure for more noise as peoples suitcases wheels get pulled along the tiles and wripped down the stairs. The ice machine will also get your attention. If you are thirsty there is a huge pop machine but be prepared to like Mountain Dew as it is the only pop that was not out of order. The parking is free, but there are limited spaces available (15) in relation to the number of rooms (40) so be prepared not to get one one if you show up after 8.00 pm. The breakfast is OK, although not as comprehensive as most other Ramadas, but there is no seating area so bring your own tray from home or use their tiny bathroom tray and take your breakfast into your room.

Its close to bus lines that will take you anywhere in the city. Just 2 blocks up is Union Street, and 2 blocks right is Filmore where shopping, bars, restruants and night life is plenty. Parking was first come first serve, however the front desk will hold your keys should you need to double park over night. I rated Hotel service a 3 because the staff were not to friendly, however they did exactly what they needed to do for me. I also rated Comfort a 3 because the pillows were a bit lumpy, but the bed was really comfortable. Over all I would recommend this to a budget traveller who wants to stay in the marina area. Access to bus lines that will take you right to the Pier area and also shopping and night spots are in walking distance. Hotel lobby is smaller than expedia's picture, however who needs a big lobby. The lobby has a kiosk with lots of available city tours you can do. They evey provide a city map with bus and trolly routes for free!! This helped a lot. The continental breakfast was small and very self serve however it did the job when you just want to eat something small before you head out. One downfall is there is some traffic noise from Lombard Ave where it is a main street. Also some noise from other hotel guests coming up and down the stairs. Being a younger traveller, it all added to an overall cool experience.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Honolulu, HI","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-02-21T23:06:26Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"4","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_ca","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"19035","reviewId":"18387002","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"4105","userNickname":"Rob","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Motel, Decent Price, Decent Service","reviewText":"I was quite impressed with this motel.

Noise: If you don't mind street noise, or the echo of other guests, this motel is alright. The two levels of rooms and outside stairwells are in a large courtyard, and the traffic noise from the street echoes too. We slept relatively well. The motel has a secure room to store our luggage while we were checked out. Breakfast: The continental breakfast was alright. Waffles were good. Cereal, Toast too. Staff were friendly enough.

If you can't, then this isn't a bad place either.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Apple Valley, MN","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-03-13T06:46:26Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"19035","reviewId":"18387106","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Ann","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Okay place to stay","reviewText":"The front desk personnel were great, and the room was clean.

If your plans include a visit to Fisherman's Wharf, it is several blocks away up and down a few hills.\n\nThe room was clean, the staff was courteous, and it even has wireless Internet! (Unfortunately I found that out AFTER the fact and forgot to bring my wireless network card) The room wasn't terribly big - about the size of a Motel 6 room - but it was more than adequate. For what I got I thought it was a bit pricey, but then again it is right in San Francisco (decent neighborhood too) and not a $40 cab ride away from most attractions. If you do drive there, you either have to park on the street or get one of their small \"first come, first serve\" spaces (about ten total), and the nearest public transportation is two streets south (again, up and down hills) so be prepared.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Santa Fe, NM","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-01-20T19:24:55Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"19035","reviewId":"18387010","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Bahareh","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Very small","reviewText":"Its a very small hotel.

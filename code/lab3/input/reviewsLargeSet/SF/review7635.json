They offered the typical egg bacon and pastry, etc. and of course some fresh fruit. So, it definitely was worth the money for breakfast otherwise, you can cross the street to McDonald which we did the one day we slept in past 10 a.m. \r\nThe hotel is fully renovated with nice clean rooms and comfortable beds with white sheets and white cover.

Again, it was no big deal because it was clean and the towels were nice and fresh. The AC unit was in the room and they can get noisy so we left the window open at night for fresh/cool San Fran air.

Then as is customary my husband was climbing into the bus with our one carry-on suitcase, only to literally be shoved back by driver, causing my husband to step on my foot. How is anyone supposed to know that the luggage goes in the back of the bus, and not inside as is typical with these busses? A suggestion would be to have a laminated sign on the door or window stating that the luggage goes in back and not inside. We saw the driver being rude to everyone as they too attempted to climb on bus with their luggage. Once at hotel I felt like a snack and in restaurant ordered the veggie wraps. When this arrived it had been deep fried. I choose to not eat anything deep fried and this fact isn't stated on the menu. Convenience made us opt for the breakfast in the morning. Being a vegan I asked for Soy milk - I was rudely informed that this wasn't available, by an employee who clearly couldn't hold his body up by himself, as he was lying on his one elbow on the desk the entire time. After just returning from Australia and New Zealand where Soy milk was provided at every single meal, (without having to request it) this was a great disappointment.

The reviews I read and the hotels sites said this was close to or 15 minutes from Dt San Fran, by bus it was closer to 45 minutes and Bart though more cost efficient (the $16.50 will get you to and from Dt to the hotel using the airport shuttle) it was still a long way from this hotel to SF. That being said the gentleman who checked us in was nice and..that is where the customer service stopped.

She saw us waiting and said that she'd be right back and went into the back.

The hotel has a workout room, which is really nice, for those of us who want to work out, complete with hand sanitizer, towels, and water fountain. There were vending machines on the floors near the elevators. There was also a restaurant onsite available for lunch and dinner. There was a Breakfast Buffet option available for guests; this seemed popular with many guests, as it was crowded when we checked it out. Parking was not mentioned on the expedia website at the time.\n\nOur room was very nice- we didn't expect the mahogany Thomasville furniture. We had blackout shades which was nice (because of the position of the room, the sunlight made it very bright, once drawn). There was a desk and chair, armchair, bed, wardrobe, side tables, two lamps, TV, as well as coffee maker, and luggage rack. The bathroom was clean.

Once in the hotel, I was not greeted by anyone and the front desk staff was not very friendly. Our room, beds, pillows, T.V., and bathroom were all tiny and old. I had just stayed at a Holiday Inn Express the previous night, which I absolutely loved, and I wished I had booked the rest of my vacation there instead. The room, beds, and bathroom were all bigger and cleaner there. Unfortunately I had pre-paid 4 nights at this nightmare of a hotel and couldn't cancel or else they would charge me 100% of the cost. As I tried to get some sleep on the most uncomfortable bed ever, all I heared were the planes going by because of the close proximity to the airport. I had backpain every day because of the bed. Everything in that breakfast \"buffet\" tasted like it just came out of the refrigerator. At least warm up the food! Thankful that it was going to be our last day there, we headed out to our car and noticed it had been vandalized. Someone completely broke the rear and passanger windows. When the police arrived they spoke to the manager and were surprised to find out that the dimly lit parking lot has absolutely no security or surveilance cameras! Even though the manager seemed sorry for our ordeal, he informed me that Best Western is in no way responsible for our losses and all he offered me in the form of a comp was a cup of coffee, which by the way is free at the breakfast buffet.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":1,"ratingHotelCondition":1,"ratingService":1,"ratingRoomComfort":1,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Monterey Park, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-09-05T23:32:31Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"7635","reviewId":"18617954","photos":[],"itinId":"284739335","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Duan","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Noise is big issue","reviewText":"Every things is alright but the noise.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-09-04T04:50:43Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"7635","reviewId":"18617358","photos":[],"itinId":"280524322","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":2,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Julie","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Not worth three stars","reviewText":"Pluses:Breakfast buffet was good.

Checked in and went to bed, got up, had breakfast and went to the airport, so I didn't see much of the hotel. Desk staff friendly and helpful. No complaints about the room; despite getting a room on a corner of the top floor and being under the SFO flight path the room was quiet. The breakfast buffet the next morning wasn't extravagant, but what they offered was freshly made and of sufficient quantity. The shuttle bus to SFO is quick and efficient. Wireless Internet access was free and worked just fine, even in my corner room. The only oddity was a housekeeping staffer who wanted into the room around 8:30pm. He seemed surprised that there was someone in the room, and I don't know why housekeeping would want to get into a guest room that late in the evening. Perhaps it was to turn on the heat in the room (which had been off)?

I don't know - the lobby has some telling logo placement that makes me think this used to be a Sheraton. Anyway, this place really is quite impressive as far as the value is concerned. My room was clean and comfortable. WiFi was included. The breakfast in the morning - i hate getting up in the morning and usually skip breakfast - but there's gave me motivation to spring to life earlier. Don't expect some kind of gourmet spread but don't expect powdered eggs and make your own waffle junk either. They use their onsite restaurant and produce actual breakfast food - that wasn't terrible. Plus some grains, fruit (apples and bananas when I was there), yogurts (Yoplait) - cereals. Good coffee. All in all, really cannot beat this for value. Some people mention it's not close to San Francisco. I suppose if you don't have a car - the yeah, it's not close. Otherwise, you can be downtown in 15 minutes or less. And with all the included stuff here - the WiFi, the breakfast, the parking (added benefit) - it's worth staying that 15 minutes out if you've got the wheels. Trust me - I've stayed in the city many times and the price difference - no comparison. You get much, much better value (it was a complete steal) compared to staying in the city.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Boston, MA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-04-22T16:09:17Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"7635","reviewId":"18618006","photos":[],"itinId":"268902867","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Jody","brandType":"Expedia","title":"It was good","reviewText":"great place to stay","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Eau Claire, WI","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-04-22T14:48:26Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"7635","reviewId":"18617300","photos":[],"itinId":"266135525","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Shannon","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Good for the money.","reviewText":"Hotel was a great deal with easy access to freeway and airport.

The staff was very friendly and helpful. We also took advantage of the free shuttle to and from the airport and used it one day to take the BART in to downtown. The bus stop was only 1/4 block up across the street #294 and this took us right downtown and from there we could walk or take the free cable cars and muni busses that were offered in our city pass book-highly recomend getting this. We were able to start our day off each morning with a free continental breakfast. This was O.K. (I'm a picky eater} but had a good selection and kept us full until lunch down at the wharf. Pool was not used, but we were busy everyday anyways. There are a few eating options within walking distance-McDonalds across street , Diner next door and one more that I can't remember name. We also could catch the bus back at night to the same stop across the street caught in the morning. We had 2 queen beds and the room was clean/nice. Our view was of McDonalds but we were tired when we got back each day. Over-all we really enjoyed our stay and enjoyed coming back at night away from all the crowds in town. Note- the bus only took us about 20 mins into town and was not bad, considering we usually do not take public transportation. If we make it back this way I would definately stay again.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Stayton ,Or.","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-11-02T18:13:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"7635","reviewId":"18617454","photos":[],"itinId":"250428859","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"DONNA","brandType":"Expedia","title":"IT WAS A HOTEL,","reviewText":"THE HOTEL WAS GOOD AS HOTELS GO.

Anyone who doesnt know South San Francisco is a city unto itself and is quite a bit south of the San Francisco proper. It does sit in the fog bowl of the southern peninsula and was foggy and windy the entire trip although Fisherman Warf was bright and sunny in the mid 70s. We were looking for a place to sleep mostly and Grosvenor hotel provided that. We checked in late and were put into a smoking room, I was told I could change the next day but decided not to hassle with it. The room did smell of smoke but not as bad as smoking room in New Orleans (could not open the windows). One problem was the window; it would not completely close so the outside noise from the planes and trucks made for a noisy night. I did not bring it the hotels attention. Like I said we only really slept there. We did take advantage of the contenental breakfast one morning and it was satisfactory. I did not have very much interaction with the staff but they seemed nice enough. I would say if you are on a vacation to San Francisco avoid this hotel. We stayed in city last time we visited and had a much better trip. The Grosvenor is exactly what it states an airport hotel and should be used as such.

The selection included scrambled eggs, potatoes, sausage, toast, bagels, croissants, sweet rolls, yogurt, cereals, and fruit. Dining options were sufficient. We ate dinner several nights in the hotel's Brass Elephant Restaurant. The food was very good. The only complaint would be that the vegetable provided with each meal seemed to be the same mixture of zucchini and carrots. There are several restaurants near the hotel. A new Chinese buffet opened down the street and it was excellent. There is a McDonald's directly across the street. The location is very near the airport, just a few blocks away, no need to even get on the freeway. The distance from downtown is probably about 15 minutes. We felt that it was centrally located to do sightseeing in any direction. The front desk personal were very helpful, even providing printouts when asked for directions. We were very satisfied with this hotel and would highly recommend it for anyone not wanting to stay in the downtown area.

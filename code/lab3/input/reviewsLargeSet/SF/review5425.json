It seems as if they have many more important things to attend to instead of their customers.  It was difficult to know where to stop for the valet since there isn't anyone out front of the hotel and the street has a large do not enter sign.  We finally called the hotel and asked about the valet and they said to pull in front and leave the car and someone would valet it.  I explained that the two spots in front of the hotel were taken they said make a U-turn and park it on the other side, luckily there was one space to squeeze into.  We lugged our luggage across the street into the hotel and spoke to a man who was standing inside the door who I assume was the valet and he was very unconcerned about lending a hand or getting our car parked.  The rest of the staff wasn't any more impressive.  The gentleman who checked us in to a King Suite (which I booked because it slept 4 and we had our 2 kids with us) informed me unsolicited that he thought the couch pulled out but if not he could have a roll-away brought up.  I suggest he read his own web-site, I already knew the couch pulled out.  It's not a large hotel he should really know the 3 or 4 room configurations.  At check-out they tried to charge me again after I already paid Expedia.  Thank goodness I noticed it and questioned her, she then said \"oh.. let me check\".

Get off the Bart at Powell St and walk up two blocks; you're there. Situated half a block from Union Square, this hotel is smack in the middle of San Francisco's high-end shopping district. The Embarcadero is a close enough walk nearby, and it's just steps to the financial district.  And of course, the classic cable car that all tourists must do at one point or another goes right by the front door!\r\nWhen my wife and I checked in, apparently their computer systems were down. The staff seemed to be handling it fairly well, but certainly lacked the smiles that I'd usually expect from the front desk. Upon check out, one of the doorman couldn't help complain about the situation to me. I had an excellent conversation with the other doorman, however, about Uber and the taxi situation in San Francisco.\r\nThe hotel itself is old but still quite beautiful.

If it worked at all, it was spotty, even the business centre had problems, with 1 of the 2 computers down at any time, and the printer didn't function one of the days.

Early morning around 7 is the only time you wont't be fighting the pedestrian masses. Our room was not ready when we got there after the stated check in time. They did give us free breakfast one day to compensate. The bathrooms are microscopic. There was almost no room to turn around in the shower. We had to ask for towels multiple times, and one day we didn't get maid service.  The restaurant is very pricey, with the only good meal being breakfast. Go to cafe bellini next door. It is somewhat cheaper, although all food in San Francisco is very very overpriced.  I thought that staying right by Union Square with all the shopping would be great, but we saw a mugging 2 blocks from the hotel plus a marching protest of about 150 people 1 block from the hotel.

Only two complaints were the HUGELY over-inflated prices on in-room convenience bar items. $8 for a small bottle of Voss water that Walgreens next door sells for $1.35. $10 for a mickey of vodka. Come on! The other complaint was that we requested a cot for our oldest son, and they forgot to have it waiting in the room for our midnight arrival. When they brought it it was covered in dust bunnies like it had been stowed in a closet for several years. They didn't clean it off first and it obviously had bedding on it that was placed some time ago. The cot was way too short for my son's 6' height.

It could only fit one occupant at a time. The old age of the building was evident in the bathroom sink (no vanity, and exposed hoses under the sink basin).  The windows for our 3rd floor room had no view, just overlooked an alley, so we just kept the interior shutters closed.  The staff was friendly and helpful.

The lobby actually did look nice in person.  The rooms were a totally different story.  We checked in and went up to our room.  It was not nice, not clean and had a terrible smell.  I went back down to the front desk and told them of the issues and they moved us to another room.  The next room was just as bad and had the same smell.  We decided that we could not stay there and left.  I tried to call Expedia.  I spent 2 hours on the phone (mainly on hold).  I finally was speaking to someone but we were disconnected.  I tried to call back but was back in line on hold.  I decided that I had wasted enough of my time and would call again once I was back home.  We just started walking down the street with our bags and were very fortunate to find a room at the Marriott.  I would totally recommend that hotel.  It was very clean and had a fantastic staff.  They recommended a restaurant called Fish & Farm it was great !!!

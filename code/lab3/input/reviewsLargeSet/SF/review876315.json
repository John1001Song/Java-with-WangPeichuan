We've stayed almost literally everywhere you can: the Nikko, the Westin St. Francis, the former Crowne Plaza, the former Powell Hotel, the Abri and just about every other boutique and chain hotel in the area. Compared with most of those, this is more of a budget accommodation, and if you've never stayed in SF before, you might find the Hotel Fusion underwhelming. However, if you have a clear picture of what Union Square hotels are like (think European style), then you'll find the Fusion a good choice. \r\n\r\nRooms and hallways are clean if not a tad tight. The continental breakfast is very European - toast, bagels, fruit all served in a tiny room. But if you're in town for a ballgame or shopping, that fits the bill just fine. \r\n\r\nOur room was inward facing, which meant no view, but also reduced street noise. Union Square can be a noisy place no matter where you stay. Maids cleaned the room early every morning - by the time we got back from breakfast around 10 a.m., the room was cleaned, which was nice. \r\n\r\nQuick tip on the parking situation: every hotel in SF charges a LOT of money to park your car, but it turns out they're just parking it in a nearby garage for a lot less and pocketing the difference. Hotel Fusion is literally a block away from the Ellis-O'Farrell parking garage, which ran me a total of $33 for a two-night stay as opposed to the $90 Hotel Fusion wanted for it.

Put simply, the accommodations are about as tight as you can get this side of the Pacific. This isn't to say it's bad, but there's no extra space for more than two people, if that matters. This is San Francisco, after all, so a lot of places are going to be pretty tight. Everything was clean and seemed pretty well maintained. Each room has its own bathroom (something that isn't true about every San Francisco hotel).\r\n\r\nThe AC unit for the room worked really well, but like many hotels in the city, it's designed to dry out the air as much as possible to prevent mold. This has obvious side-effects, so you'll want to keep a bottle of water handy, or just turn off the AC as often as possible. I used to live in Las Vegas, and I never felt as dehydrated as I did after a night in my room.\r\n\r\nWhile the room is nothing to get too excited about, the location is perfect. It's about 5 minutes to dozens of spots, including Moscone Center. There is a decent nightclub downstairs and some good restaurants within a block or two.\r\n\r\nPut simply, the rooms are bargain priced, but there's nothing actually bad about them, unlike many other spots in the city.

GREAT location, right by union square, lots of shopping around and easy to pick up a bus or cab anywhere around. Also, a great little Jazz club/restaurant right down Ellis. Although the room was cute (small but clean - very compact but had all the amenities) the bed was very hard. I mean HARD. I was sore both days after and I am an active 27 year old. The hotel also had a very harsh smell of cleaning products that was unpleasant and gave my friend a headache. The bathroom was great - big glass shower, although no counter space, no hooks, and no shelves. The best part of this experience was that the hotel offers free robes in the room, free wifi, and free continental breakfast of juice, coffee, muffins, bagels, danishes, apples and oranges. Overall, I would stay again because the price was right and the location was great, but I'd see a few rooms to see if I could get a softer bed. I also did not like how they charged an extra $20 per night for a bed switch to two doubles instead of one queen - most hotels do this free of charge. The street was noisy because of the location, but the window air conditioner had a fan mode and we kept that on all night to drown out the noise in the street. Great Asian/Japanese food across the street, as well. I also liked the few mini bar snacks offered for a reasonable price and the mini fridge to store beer/wine or leftovers.

Overall room size was tiny, bathroom had no window and the ventilation did little to deal with the steam. The shower itself was small, but with great water pressure. This was probably the best part of the entire room. The windows in the bedroom didn't open (and had a note in marker on the window saying not to open it.)

Rather than wait, I went downstairs with my confirmation that showed I had a queen room. The woman at the front desk had attitude and showed me an itinerary and said that it showed I reserved a twin bed. I looked at the itinerary and it was for someone else. The nice man at the front desk fixed everything and we were able to get a queen room. Unfortunately, we ended up having two $100 holds on my credit card because they do a $100 hold for incidentals. Luckily I used my credit card and not my debit card. The room itself was dated and looked nothing like the pictures on their website. There was no remote control for the TV.

There is some kind of compressor (air conditioning?) located either on the roof of the building or somewhere adjacent to room 518 that keeps turning on and off (even in December, when AC should not be working). When it turns on, there's loud humming noise in the room, which is especially noticeable at night. You can also feel vibration in the floor and the walls. If you are a light sleeper like myself, this will wake you up repeatedly throughout the night. Front desk stuff sent a maintenance person to look into the noise issue but he couldn't do anything to fix it. Also, the room does not look as nice in real life as it does in the pictures.

Reasonable priced - stayed in a suite which was less than most other hotels in the area for single room. definetly would stay again.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"proximity, service, clean, breakfast","negativeRemarks":"air conditioner","locationRemarks":"shopping, museums/galleries, bart, cable car, buses around the block with access to the whole city.","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2013-10-09T22:59:11Z","roomTypeId":200163245,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"25","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_au","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"876315","reviewId":"59172927","photos":[],"itinId":"1782400775","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"3081","userNickname":"John","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Good Location","reviewText":"The hotel was well located.\n\nRoom was a little smaller than expected but clean.

I chose the hotel based on location and price. The hotel is located in the town and is literally a 2 minute walk away from the Powell Street BART station and Cable Car terminus.\n\nThe bed was very comfortable and the room spotlessly clean. There was a safe in the room, and a fridge with mini bar and a selection of candy bars (you have to pay for them - around $2.50 each) and tea/coffee making facilities. The bathroom was again very clean and had a good shower.\n\nI had read previous reviews on noise from the nightclub in the basement and specifically asked for a quiet room at the rear of the hotel. I got a room on the fourth floor at the rear of the hotel and didn't hear any nightclub noise at all (and I'm a light sleeper!).\n\nI thought the breakfast choice was more than satisfactory, you help yourself to fresh orange juice, coffee, tea, cereals, toast, bagels, pastries and fresh fruit and take them back to your room. Only slight niggle, breakfast is only served 7am - 9am and I'm not a morning person, so serving until 10am would have been better!\n\nI spoke to reception a few times and always found them very friendly and helpful.\n\nOverall, I was very satisfied with the Hotel Fusion and wouldn't hesitate to stay again on my next trip to San Francisco.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"Location.

I had a room on the air shaft so it was QUIET and shielded from street noise, altho not a lot of natural light.\nStaff was really good and accommodating. so top marks there.\nLocation location location. can't be beat for to/from moscone.\nfree internet was hit and miss/ get what you pay for.. i had my wireless card so didn't need to rely on hotel.\n\noverall a decent hotel. if you can get a room price deal, that would be best as i think if you pay rack rate you'd feel gipped.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Chicago","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-09-06T03:49:34Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"hotelId":"876315","reviewId":"19292251","photos":[],"itinId":"383428968","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":1,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Jake","brandType":"Expedia","title":"I have never paid more for less","reviewText":"Small room, pathetic, old, small worn out mattress, rude 'service', no concierge, no valet on duty, limited and expensive parking in the area, difficult to get to by car, barely an attempt at a continental breakfast, no A/C, window without a screen and a fan for climate control, TOTAL buyers remorse.

They asked if I wanted to be moved to a different room but since it was late, I opted to change the room next next day instead. The thumping stopped about 2am but needlessly to say, I did not get a good night's sleep. The next day, they moved me one floor up but basically, it was almost the same thing the next night.

The carpet was stained & there was a mild mildewy smell from the bathroom. Overall the hotel is rather run-down. While poor service at a great establishment can ruin an experience the converse is not true. They staff were friendly & helpful but could not overcome the poorly designed hotel which had no sound insulation in the walls or ceilings. Apparently when the people upstairs use the bathroom the pipes run down through the wall behind the bed so you know your neighbors habits. People walking across the ceiling sound like mastadons on a rampage.

Although the area has little traffic at night, every conceivable vehicle with a siren passed the hotel, all night and every night. Trucks delivered during the small hours and we were treated to the beeps when the trucks backed up, slowly. We had to buy an electric fan and earplugs to sleep. The hotel looked great, on the surface. The reception is very modern, everything looks recently remodelled and there are even mini TV screens mounted in the walls next to the elevators, for whatever reason. The list of surface expense goes on. Some of that money could have gone into room comfort since I don't tend to sleep in the reception or hallway when at a hotel.

We enjoyed the friendliness of the staff, especially the presence of the Concierge. A standout was the comfortability of our spacious room & even larger bathroom (a welcome relief after experiences in Europe!). Perhaps the best feature was its location: right in the middle of Downtown made it very easy to get everywhere we wanted to go, (as long as you plan to make Fisherman's Wharf & surrounding areas a day trip, rather than a stroll). With only a 20 minute journey to/from the airport also, it inclined us to make the most of our San Fran experience. If we returned, we would be looking forward to a fully 'fused' hotel. That is, by its own admission, Hotel Fusion is still building/renovating their breakfast room, and the interim measure of an almost broom cupboard-sized space for take-away breakfasts was disappointing. Apart from this hiccup, we would highly recommend Hotel Fusion as a most comfortable place to stay, and deserving of at least one more star in its crown.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Melbourne","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-08-25T05:39:37Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"876315","reviewId":"19292372","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Afsar","brandType":"Expedia","title":"safe -close to union square -nice","reviewText":"The hotel is close to union square and close to bart Powel Station and tram station at Powel street.I feel safe as You can take.Have cable flat TV ,clean and nice rooms..They serve breakfast from a room(you go and grab breakfast ;like juice,jam,etc;jut keep in mind; there might be line as it is a small room and people wait to toast their bagels...Overall I am satisfied and liked the Fusion Hotel...","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"New York","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-08-20T04:10:32Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"876315","reviewId":"19292373","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Ray","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Good value for the area","reviewText":"Hotel Fusion was satisfactorily clean and comfortable; kinda funky.

There is also a very good self serve free breakfast in the morning consisting of toast, bagels, cream cheese, fruit, muffins, juice, coffee, and hot chocolate. The hotel is fairly quiet at night and the walls are thick enough to filter out your neighbors. The only negative is that the single twin rooms face other rooms across an air shaft, so you'll sometime hear people across the way through their windows. If you close your window at night, you'll be able to sleep soundly without a problem. The hotel is near tons of food and shopping choices and near all transportation options to all the major tourist destinations. The neighborhood is safe at all hours.

The complimentary continental breakfast is limited but that's pretty much standard.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"San Diego, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-05-14T11:58:21Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"3","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_gb","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"876315","reviewId":"19292428","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"2057","userNickname":"Graham","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Excellent location","reviewText":"The hotel was superbly situated for downtown SF and then also for the cable cars to Fishermans Wharf or the trains, trams and buses to the respective sites of SF.

However, the sounds of the city (sirens, car horns, etc) didn't make for the most restful sleep so while I would recommend this hotel, make sure you are prepared for the noise (bring earplugs!). Also, parking anywhere downtown is expensive and parking spaces are scarce so if your plan is to stick close to downtown and do the odd excusion outside of the city, I would recommend renting a car for a day or 2 from one of the nearby rental locations to avoid the $25/day valet parking at the hotel.

The staff was friendly and obliging. I kept the DO NOT DISTURB sign on my room door at all times and the cleaning staff respected it. The breakfast room was adequate. They offered juices, coffee, croissants, muffins, and toast (although you had to eat in your own room). The room I stayed in was a twin room, which was perfect for me. A clean and comfortable bed, a fridge, a TV, a lovely (and clean) bathroom with towels and toiletries, and an in-room safe. There were several clean drawers too. The only downside was the thin walls, you could hear muffled talking and when the TV was on in other rooms. It wasn't an annoyance, though. I slept soundly every night.

We are happy to suggest this hotel to others for the following reasons: It was extremely clean (spotless), comfortable, and the decor was new and modern. The staff were friendly and provided us with suggetions on what to see and how to get around. The front desk has great maps, etc. This location is wonderful! Great if you want to shop, eat, check out the trollies, and the pubs. **incredible shopping nearby!** Regarding the hotel rooms, I was pretty impressed that although this hotel is older, it has been completely rennovated and is 100% wheelchair accessable. Our whole room (including the washroom) was fully equipped for anyone who has special needs. The Fusion also leaves complementary RUSK haircare products and lotions which were really nice. I liked the fact they didn't use the typical \"cheapo\" shampoos etc. that are typically used by hotels. The room also has a safe, and a fridge (fully stocked) and the Fusion leaves a large and very tempting basket of snacks and candy. This neighborhood is absolutely safe. There is an area called tenderloin which you don't want to go into, but it is several blocks away. You can't go wrong if you stay at this hotel. There is no reason to spend a fortune on a really expensive hotel - the Fusion was a really great stay.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Winnipeg","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-10-17T22:25:10Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"876315","reviewId":"19292265","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Dominic","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great Deal Great Location","reviewText":"Small room, but well designed, recently remodeled, clean and comfortable.

Our window had no screen, and it opened up to a roof with many other windows- not much privacy. Also, the maid barged in on our room once at 8am, and came at random times without warning. Overall, we recommend this hotel due to the central location and warm and friendly staff.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Thousand Oaks, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-07-25T01:16:30Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"876315","reviewId":"19292377","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"L","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Excellent choice","reviewText":"My friend and I stayed at the Fusion Hotel for 7 days-we were totally impressed by the quality of the hotel, the helpful staff,and the excellent location- Union Square, one block from the cable car turn-around and the Muni/BART station.

Staff were friendly and helpful and the unexpected free buffet breakfasts a definite plus. Rooms are clean and well maintained, having recently been renovated, but travellers should not expect the benefits of air conditioning in all rooms (hardly necessary in San Francisco at any time of the year). Free internet access is available in all of the rooms, and those wishing to end their stay in style may like to take the Lincoln (limousine) service back to the airport which cost just $5 more than the taxi had cost. Altogether, the perfect budget hotel with excellent access to Union Square, Powell Street cable cars (2 minutes), Market Street tram service to Castro / Mission areas and the Piers via cable car. Other commentators have mentioned the less salubrious areas to the right of the hotel (along Ellis Street), but it is not necessary to go in this direction to access any of the sights and a visible Police presence was reassuring.

The rooms were very clean and nicely furnished and set-up in a contemporary style. The rooms are a bit small but fine for two people. I loved that the window faced Ellis Street and you could here the mood of the city. One of the best things about Fusion was I was one block frm the BART system which can get me anywhere around the Bay area, one block from the Trolleys, and a couple of blocks from the F bus line which takes you from the Whorf to downtown and visa versa. Just two blocks away is Weisfields shopping center, you can imagine whats in there. Shuttle service was a breeze to and from the SF airport.

The reception staff were extremely friendly, the friendliset I've ever encountered in a hotel. They happily provided information when we asked, even checking the itnernet and printing info off for us. Our double room was imaculate, and we had booked the standard room. We had 2 beds, 2 flat screen tvs, a fridge, a safe and a large bathroom. We were not disturbed by noise at all which was excellent as we needed our sleep at night! The complimentary buffet breakfast in the morning was an excellent start to the day, with muffins and croissants available along with toast facilities, tea, coffee and juice. The whole holiday we could not believe we had picked such a great hotel, especially for the price we paid.

They went out of there way to help us find places around San Francisco and helped us arrange trips! The queen bed room was nice but quite small. Clean towels and bed linen everyday. Bathroom was huge and spotless. Hotel Fusion was in a great location! Walk out of the hotel and turn left and you have cable cars to your right and 2 minutes walk to the left you have Union Square. Close by you also have buses that take you everywhere but the BART and MUNI were the best modes of transport and they were next to the cable car. I dont have a bad thing to say about Hotel Fusion, it was great for a hotel with friendly staff, clean basic rooms and cheap. The only slight thing about San Francisco as a whole was the amount of homeless people who were everywhere!

If you are traveling in the spring, summer, or fall, be accutely aware there is no air conditioning. The hotel does *NOT* include complementary parking, but they will park for you at 31 dollars a day, or you can find a parking area within a few blocks to park for 30 dollars a night, to save a dollar. Center rooms (all looking inward in the building) have very poor ventilation, and if you call room service, and complain loudly enough, you might get a small fan. I used mine to draw a bit of air from the center area, it takes a long time to cool down the room so that one can sleep at night. The hotel did not make me aware of the fact they could scrounge up a small fan, until I complained about the room- and very tired from the lack of sleep...it stayed hot all night long without the fan. An associate that stayed there with me was lucky enough to get an exterior room, which even had a view of San Francisco (instead of looking in the window of another room 10 feet away and facing you), which allowed the normal wind that blows outside to cool his room off after awhile. Recommendations to travelers is to demand a fan at check-in.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":1,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Salem, OR","reviewSubmissionTime":"2006-06-20T19:23:25Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"876315","reviewId":"19292174","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"chris","brandType":"Expedia","title":"would love to keep a secret!","reviewText":"This is an excellent little boutique hotel.

The location is fantastic - a block away from Powell Station and a cable car station, so easy to get to and from the airport using the BART. Located downtown with great shopping and restaurants nearby. The rooms are small, but the hotel was renovated only four months ago, so the carpets are clean, hallways bright, mattresses are new (those new thick foam mattresses that conform to your body - I prefer the old-fashioned spring ones), wall-mounted LCD TVs, new showers and even boutique-grade toiletries and thick towels. Small coffee machine in the room and free USA Today newspaper in the lobby are nice freebies. They have a tiny gym with only a treadmill, elliptical machine and a weight bench - not much, but more than you would expect from a 2-star hotel. Only drawback is that staying downtown is pretty noisy early in the morning. Do youreself a favour and ask for an inside room or one that does NOT face Ellis Street.

Highly recommende it!!!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Bloomington, IN","reviewSubmissionTime":"2006-04-05T03:21:13Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"876315","reviewId":"19292172","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Elynor","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Relaxing Haven","reviewText":"Fantastic location, great attention to detail (down to the thick, fluffy towels, firm foam bed and flat screen TV/DVD) and friendly staff made a great trip even better.

The hotel itself has a more residential apartments feel than a hotel, with little in the way of lobby/bars etc and its all very quiet.  The furniture and fittings are a little dated in places, but the bed was very comfy,  it was very clean and room service was lightening fast.  Staff were all helpful and overall it felt like a well run and welcoming place.  Each Friday and Saturday at 5pm they offer free drinks to residents on the 40th floor terrace.

We had a Jr. Suite with a Golden Gate view which was to die for on the 39th floor. My husband used the gym and thought it was more up-to-date than the Planet Fitness facility he uses at home. The business center is small but serviceable. The hotel staff was fantastic and their recommendation for dining, day excursions, travel route, even parking was always spot on and invaluable. Given our short stay, we needed to bat 1000 on all that we did and working with the hotel staff helped us achieve that goal.

Upon arrival to the room, our room service waiter (Simon) brought us complimentary Jasmine Tea (delish!), and a few minutes later, the bellman brought us a computer print out of the places he recommended earlier.  The service was fantastic, and the bed was even better!  We didn't want to get out of it in the am... Soft soft soft!!!  The room was nice.  Decor was very simple, however, we had a king size bay view room, and the extra $$ was well worth it!  The view was worth a million bucks!  Only down-side to the property was it was located in the financial district.  Not too far from everything, however, not right in the hub. All in all, FABULOUS stay, would highly recommend, and visit again!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"LAS VEGAS","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-01-13T06:31:15Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"6505","reviewId":"20277132","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Dora","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Deserving of its reputation","reviewText":"Service was excellent.

We felt like we got a big bargain by the end.  We had an infant child with us, and upon checking in, they delivered an infant gift to the room with Diapers, shampoos, powders, etc.  Tea is delivered upon arrival.  The concierge and bell men are truly friendly, and they do remember every guest.  Views from the room are great.  The location is perfect for access to the best shopping and the best restaurants in the City.  Best shower water pressure I have ever experienced.  Very clean room.  In short, the service is what every hotel should strive for.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Minneapolis","reviewSubmissionTime":"2004-10-06T19:10:59Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]}]}}}

I would honestly give this hotel 2 stars just because it is in a great location ONLY. I was advised by Expedia, that because it was so late that I should try to hang in there for the night and to do an early check out in the morning so that they could get me another room at a different hotel for the remaining 4 days of my trip. No one slept that night and we wasted almost the entire next day looking for another room and fighting for the remaining 4 days of what we paid upfront for that room. WHAT A JOKE!! This hotel would make for a nice stay if it were taken care of but that is certainly not the case here. Hire a better cleaning staff.

We took it and although the bedroom and separate sitting area (with sofa bed) give you more privacy, there rooms were still quite small and did not have enough storage space.  My king sized bed was comfortable, but my kids complained about how uncomfortable the sofa bed was. \r\nOur room was right on the corner of North Point St and Mason (4th floor - room 415). It was so noisy!  You can hear every truck pass by, at night you can hear all of the drunk people yelling as they walk down the street. I wondered if it would have been quieter had I kept the original room I had booked. \r\nAcross the street from my room is a Longshoreman's Hall which is where you can see several homeless people staying. We weren't bothered, but I wouldn't feel very comfortable walking past there at night. Despite this hall being across the street, the hotel itself is conveniently located near several key locations such as Pier 39, Fisherman's Wharf, tour locations, cable car routes, etc...\r\nOverall, room was clean, my bed was comfortable, and the staff was all friendly and appeared eager to assist with all my needs.

The room itself contained a dresser with locked mini-fridge, 32\" flat TV, a night stand between the beds with a phone that doubled as a phone charger/music speaker.  There was also a work desk with lamp/chair/device charging station.  The wifi was free for guests for as many devices as you need.  The bathroom was small and contained a full tub/shower as well as a toilet.  The shower had great pressure and the water was HOT.  Oddly the vanity/mirror were located outside the bath/toilet area but shared the same light/fan switch, which lit up the room in the middle of the night.  There was also a hair dryer/iron & board, and small room safe.  The room included an AC/Heater unit that worked and added some white noise. Windows did not open.  Beds/pillows to be extremely comfortable.  Not hard or soft.  The bedding included a down comforters which kept us cozy.\r\n\r\nThe hotel is located near a great breakfast place (Pat's Cafe) and cable car/trolley lines on Taylor.

By the time you spend $62 on parking per night, tax, and fees it is over $250 and by no means does this hotel warrant that price point.  They took the coffee away from the lobby at 9:30am on a Sat. morning. Why?  Even cheap 2star hotels have coffee/tea for patrons all day.

There nothing wrong with the hotel or room except that you can hear EVERYTHING outside the street. Every word of conversations as people pass by. Yelling and screaming at 2am. Drunk people passing by at 3am. People leaving for the airport at 5am. Footsteps from the room above me. It's too bad since I liked the location at The Wharf; you should know that there is a noticable number of homeless and travellers begging in the Wharf area though. You also have to take a cab to non-touristy dining, with the exception of Albona Italian nearby, according to the concierge. Albona had delicious cuisine with average service but it's not a scenic location. I'd like to give it a higher rating as the bed was comfortable, the room was charming, the staff was excellent and there was a free wine and snack reception 5-6pm every night - and the Chardonnay was not bad - but being kept up all night by noise ruined it.

I spent a week in San Francisco about 9 years ago and stayed in the financial district and after staying at The Tuscan this time, I have no idea why I did that.  The Best Western Plus The Tuscan is located near Fisherman's Wharf and very convenient to almost anything you want to do and see in San Francisco.  Frankly, the location cannot be beat.  \r\n\r\nWe were an early check in an although our room wasn't ready, the staff was very pleasant and accommodating and stored our bags while we went out for some sight seeing.  They called me on my cell phone when our room was ready which was still 2 hours earlier than normal check-in.  The room was perfect for us with a kind sized bed and plenty of room for my girlfriend and me.  The restaurant adjoining the hotel had good food and very courteous staff.\r\n\r\nI must say the staff at the hotel was always very courteous and friendly throughout our stay.  The rooms aren't real big but they aren't small either and frankly we didn't spend much time as we were constantly on the go.  I think the best thing about the Tuscan is that it is so close to everything.  I certainly will stay here again when I come back to San Francisco.\r\n\r\n","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"Location and friendly staff.","negativeRemarks":"It was perfect for us.","locationRemarks":"The Tuscan is only a couple blocks from Fisherman's Wharf and the bay.

Although the wharf is a little tacky and touristy it is very lively and interesting with people and places to see and eat. It has great views of the bay, Golden Gate bridge and Alcatraz. \r\nThe hotel was very convenient for me as the tours I had booked online met at the tour operator office just 100 metres from the hotel. Also the cable car terminus was in the next road just 200 metres away. San Francisco is a great place to visit but you need to plan your journeys and check public transport to the places you want to see as walking up the hills is not for the unfit or faint hearted. \r\nThings I would recommend are Alcatraz, 17 mile drive, Muir woods (all can be booked in advance) Union Sq and Market St. for shopping.  Coit Tower for the view and Lombard crooked street.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"Location.

Make no mistake: Parking is without question expensive in San Francisco. The Tuscan offers Valet only parking with unlimited in/out privileges. The price for parking is $50.00 plus tax per night for standard sized cars. Some guests find other alternatives at local parking facilities or find street parking as a viable option. We do suggest that parking on the street or at local facilities which do not offer in/out privileges may have some drawbacks and involves some risk. Of course, the ease, convenience and personalized attention of using our valet parking service are well worth the expense for many of our guests. In fact, our prices are very competitive with area hotels who provide valet service parking.

The Tuscan offers Valet only parking with unlimited in/out privileges. The price for parking is $50.00 plus tax per night for standard sized cars. Some guests find other alternatives at local parking facilities or find street parking as a viable option. We do suggest that parking on the street or at local facilities which do not offer in/out privileges may have some drawbacks and involves some risk. Of course, the ease, convenience and personalized attention of using our valet parking service are well worth the expense for many of our guests. In fact, our prices are very competitive with area hotels who provide valet service parking. I actually suggest not even bringing a car to SF unless absolutely necessary as our public transportation system is awesome.\n\nHopefully the rest of your SF adventure was satisfying.

Called down to ask to have my bill prepared, explaining I was in a hurry to meet the town car I'd booked and catch my plane. Said I'd only used one water from the mini bar, and was told she couldn't do up my bill until I actually came downstairs - even though I'd prepaid for the room itself. Went down to checkout, had to wait for almost 5 minutes at the front desk for someone to return. Total bill was under $3, so wanted to pay cash, which took another 5 minutes!

Indeed it is a little more expensive to stay in the fisherman's wharf area. Not only are we the top tourist attraction in SF, we are one of the top 10 tourist attractions in the United States. Being right in the middle of fisherman’s wharf, you can’t beat the location for shops, restaurants and all the activities near the wharf and around Pier 39.\n\nParking is without question expensive in San Francisco. The Tuscan offers Valet only parking with unlimited in/out privileges. The price for parking is $50.00 plus tax per night for standard sized cars. Some guests find other alternatives at local parking facilities or find street parking as a viable option. We do suggest that parking on the street or at local facilities which do not offer in/out privileges may have some drawbacks and involves some risk. Of course, the ease, convenience and personalized attention of using our valet parking service are well worth the expense for many of our guests. In fact, our prices are very competitive with area hotels who provide valet service parking.

The price of parking in San Francisco, New York and other major metropolitan areas can be quite pricey. We never hide our parking fees; in fact they are posted on all booking web sites. Parking at The Tuscan is valet only with unlimited in/out privileges. Our guests are not obligated to park on the property; in fact some guests find other alternatives at local parking facilities or find street parking as a viable option. We do suggest that parking on the street or at local facilities which do not offer in/out privileges may have some drawbacks and involves some risk. Of course, the ease, convenience and personalized attention of using our valet parking service are well worth the expense for many of our guests. In fact, our prices are very competitive with area hotels who provide valet service parking.

This is my second visit with my Mum who has never been. Sure it is touristy but you can't beat that wharf and sea views. The walk along the wharf is marvellous.

I had read many wonderful reviews for the Tuscan Inn and was expecting a great experience. Upon check in we asked about rooms that had views, the gal at the front desk explained that the other buildings surrounding the best western were taller which limited the views from the hotel rooms. That was understandable, however I know they at least have courtyard view rooms.\nAfter finding our room we were disappointed to find that it was tucked away in the corner between a cleaning closet and stairwell. It was very noisy with housekeeping coming in and out banging their carts and supplies around. Although the room was very small and the view was of another building we were pleased to see how clean everything was. The bed and linens were very comfortable. The morning of check out we had a maintenance issue with our room. Luckily it was close to our check out time. As we checked out we informed the front desk staff of the issue with our room and they gladly waived our parking fee.

There was free lemon water, coffee and tea in the lobby. Also complimentary wine during the\nevenings.\nThe hotel is an easy 3 block walk to the marina waterfront with all the tourist attractions. There is an abundance of shopping, restaurants, arts, markets and services in easy walking distance. It cost about $10 to take a cab to the Union Sq area. And the airport shuttle was less than $20.\nI was there on business, and grew to like being a bit away from the conjestion of the financial district. It made me feel more like a local.

We had a 5 night stay at the Tuscan Inn. Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by Roy who mentioned our Anniversary and Birthday celebrations. We were given an upgrade from a Queen room to a corner King Suite! BEAUTIFUL room and very comfortable bed. Housekeeping was great and they kept us well stocked with towels and amenities. We would venture out early in the AM and the room was ALWAYS serviced upon our return. Only issue was our tub handle which came off as we turned water on and we DID let front desk know but it looked like it was not an easy fix and we really did not wish to change rooms. Water pressure and temp were excellent so we just turned faucet on slow and it was all good! ALL hotel staff were gracious, friendly and said hello whenever we passed them. I've read other reviews on this property about how NOISY the street view rooms are but we were not bothered by that a bit...maybe we were exhausted at the end of our days. Concierge did a great job setting us up with massages at Project Zen on Bay St. and one of the city bus tours. LOVED the comp coffee in the AM and the evening wine reception. We were usually out and about so we only got to the wine reception 1 or 2 times. Had dinner at Pescatore on property....really delicious!! Very tasty crab raviolis and calamari! We were SO close to the Wharf...would definitely stay here again!!

Pay $14 for an all day ticket that allows you to jump off and on as often as you like as its better value than the fixed $6 per journey ticket regardless of distance.\nIf there is a big queue at the cable car station, walk one block along the line and you'll find you'll be able to get on the next car without the wait.\nThe hotel is 10 minutes on foot from Pier 39, and a similar distance to the Powell and Hyde cable car station and the promenade and beach beyond.

Apparently that was a mistake. I booked MONTHS ago and requested that one of the rooms have two beds as I was going to be traveling with my two adult children. The front desk manager was super nasty on the phone and told me I'd just have to wait until check in-I figured maybe she was having a bad day. Dealt with her again (remembered her unusual name) at check in and she was even more nasty and told us \"sorry\" and turned away. We checked back when she was not at the desk (there were several male front desk people who were very kind) and were told there would be availability for the room with two doubles the next two nights and to come to the desk that afternoon. Guess who was back at the desk? She told us \"no\". The room was the tiniest hotel room I have ever been in and was not very nice. I have written tons of reviews on Expedia after many, many trips and always tried to post positive things about the places we have stayed and I am generally a \"glass half full\" kind of girl...but this was really bad. The room was very dated and very dark. For the same money, you would do much better to go down the street to the Hyatt or across the way to the Radisson (which features sleep number beds). We checked out early and paid for a different hotel. Even the Holiday Inn has better rooms-truly.

In our 4 night stay, however, neither of us found the room cramped, the en suite was good and the bed superbly comfortable!\nUnless you have to be in the centre, on top of the shops, you will not be disappointed by its location - a few minutes walk from: buses, trams and the famous cable cars; Pier 39 and its eateries and sea lions; Pier 33 and trips to Alcatraz and, of course, great views of the bay and its bridges. Even closer is the attached cafe/restaurant, which serves good meals at reasonable prices, and is popular with both residents and non-residents.\nCustom for the latter is encouraged by the tasty morsels they provide during the excellent nightly happy hour, when the hotel provides free wine for guests, and which succeeds in creating a very sociable atmosphere.

Not too thrilled with that but it was very quiet? My main complaint was that the room was very small-not much room to move around. The bathroom was a nice size though. The best thing about the hotel is the location. We did not rent a car so had to walk everywhere. The location of the hotel to Fisherman's Wharf made it easy to walk to all the attractions we wanted to see. Our walk to the Alcatraz Pier was only about 15 minutes. There is also a bus stop right across the street and the cable car was only a block away. Northpoint Shopping Centre is right across the street, which has a Safeway and a Walgrens. We bought our bus pass at Walgrens so that made it quite easy to get around. We had breakfast every morning at the the restaurant in the hotel-Pescatores-and it was very good.

But, unlike other US hotels on our recent trip, you are always going to have to make some sacrifices because of that location. The room, although having 2 queens, was on the small side and, since there were 4 of us, it was a bit difficult to keep it tidy. No breakfast, but coffee available for a couple of hours or so in paper cups on a morning. Bonus was the daily wine reception every afternoon, which got loads of people into the lobby and chatting. One or two had dogs too, so I guess the place must be dog-friendly. Major drawback, as with many SF locations, is parking. We paid for 4 days vallet-parking and, with the tax, that came out at about 200 bucks. On reflection, it might have been better to have terminated our hire at SF on arrival and the to have taken out a new hire when we left. A car in SF is pretty much a liability for tourists anyway and, since the city is pretty small, taxis are always going to be an option if it's just too far to walk.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"location","negativeRemarks":"the cost of parking","locationRemarks":"right on Fisherman's Wharf","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"County Durham, UK","reviewSubmissionTime":"2012-08-25T05:03:14Z","roomTypeId":264141,"userDisplayName":"Chris","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":3,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":3,"hotelId":"3552","reviewId":"38109680","photos":[],"itinId":"147867697915","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":1,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"FIND ANOTHER HOTEL IMMEDIATELY","reviewText":"The hotel was not adequately vented and air-conditioned, even though San Francisco's air is a great temperature.

As a native of San Francisco, I knew the neighborhood and wanted to steer clear of anything on Lombard Street, where experience has shown that the hotels are a bit run down.\nService was good, the lobby a bit small and crowded, with many guests lounginh there, so seats are hard to find. Our room was on the first floor, up a few steps from the lobby. It was tiny for a family of four, with barely room to walk around the beds. The refrigerator must have been an \"honor bar\" as it was locked, so we had nowhere to chill our beverages. The street noise, even on early Sunday morning, was quite obnoxious, with garbage trucks and honking horns at a very early hour. If you decide to stay here, I recommend requesting a room on the upermost floors to avoid the noise. Overall, a decent and clean hotel in a convenient location, but quite expensive (including $40 for parking) for a minimal accomodation.

Once they told me to look for slatted doors and follow the hum, I finally found it. We also had a phone message, so we punched the \"message retrieval\" button on the phone, but when it didn't get to our message, the front desk told us to call 700.

We have relatives in California that recommended different areas to stay but we wanted to do the \"tourist\" things and decided to stay in Fisherman's Wharf. I chose Tuscan Inn because of location and because they could accomodate 6 people the best - room/money. We rented 2 rooms, each having a king size bed and a fold out couch so everyone had plenty of sleeping room. The rooms were next to each other but did not have an adjoining door which wasn't an issue with our group. We stayed 3 nights. The maids were friendly and courteous. Our 3rd day I just asked for clean towels so they wouldn't have to work around the boys clothes piles. Concierge Staff was extremely helpful with directions, where to catch the Bart or other transportation, making reservations, etc. We also went to Oakland A's vs. Yankees game. The concierge gave us instructions on taking the quickest route (bus and Bart) and recommended taking a taxi from Embarcadero on the trip home if the buses weren't running anymore.\nThe location of the hotel was great. A Walgreens and a grocery store across the street. The Wharf a few blocks away. Lots of sidewalk cafes close by. Complimentary wine from 5-7 pm was a nice way to take a break before heading out for the evening. The only negative was the street noise which was only an issue on the night of July 4th - lots of people yelling on the streets that night.

The reason why we had to move rooms was because we didn't have hot water in our room, and after taking two lukewarm showers we were fed up.\n\nWhen I started the shower we let the water run for 15 minutes. I called the desk, who sent an engineer up to fix this. He ran the water in the shower, sink and flushed the toilet for another 15 minutes before it finally got hot enough to use. The reason he gave for this was the fact that because of the low occupancy on the second floor, it takes longer for the water to reach the rooms.\n\nUpon receiving our complaint, your front desk agent \"upgraded\" us to a suite on the third floor, with a lovely view of a brick wall and a bathroom door that couldn't open all the way because the bed is in the way.\n\nThe agent sent a bellman to assist us with changing rooms. When the bellman arrived, he merely handed me a key. I said \"You didn't bring a luggage cart\"? He should have brought that cart up automatically, as we had already been extremely inconvenienced.\n\nIn addition, in our original room, some of the clean towels left were ripped and should never have been utilized for guest services.

Deluxe package entitles you to the biscuit and coffee in the morning and the glass of wine in the evening if you like as well, for those who like to schmooze. Just one block to the cable car line and with a nice little restaurant attached makes for less bumbling about.

We just relaxed in their comfortable lobby area by the fire and had a great time before going out to eat. Alcatraz tour was really nice, as was the Muir Woods/Sausalito tour although we could have skipped the Sausalito part. We did the city bus tour and the Golden Gate Bridge tour in the double decker bus and it was well worth it also. We rented a car for a day and drove down to Pebble Beach and the 17 mile Drive. That was really nice also, on the way back stopped for supper at Half Moon Bay, a small restaurant there off the main hwy but the main street that runs thru town. It is on the inland side of the road near the very north end. The rooms at the hotel are small but very comfortable, terrific beds and pillows.

They have complementary coffee, tea, and hot chocolate in the morning and in the evening they have a complementary wine/beer tasting. It's great! Although the hotel is not that far from the SF airport, the shuttle back to the airport took an hour and 15 minutes because they pick up other people along the way. It's much cheaper than a taxi but you'll have to plan your hotel departure with this in mind. If you like the Blues, there's a cozy bar/restaurant with live Blues music every night on Pier 47.

The staff is courteous and professional, and the concierge is very helpful. The hotel has a nice boutique feel to it, partly due to the lobby with fireplace, wine tasting every evening, and biscotti for breakfast. The rooms are extremely clean and have windows that actually open to the outside. We had a courtyard view of trees and flowers. Our room was furnished in tones of dark red and black, including a bolster pillow and shams. The hallways are clean and nicely lit to add to the boutique feel. The hotel is eco-friendly, which I liked. They only change your sheets and towels everyday if you request. If you don't want them changed, they still remake and clean the room. The towels were nice sized and thick, and there were plenty of them. The shower head was up pretty high which is great for tall travelers. There was also a curved curtain which allows you more room when showering. I especially liked the aromatherapy bath soap, lotion, shampoo, and conditioner. We got a great night's sleep due to the comfortable bed and quiet.

Its location is central to Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39 and Ghiradelli Square and just a short safe walk to the North Beach area and the cable car lines. You can easily access the very inexpensive streetcar system which runs the Embarcadero area.

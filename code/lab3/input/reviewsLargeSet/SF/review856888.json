Our room was very spacious, the bed was comfy and the seating area was great! Each room has a larger than average hotel fridge and a microwave. The room does have blackout shades despite some of the reviews on here. I'm not sure how people missed them! \r\nBreakfast has many options and it's free! Parking wasn't an issue at all. They do charge $10, but we knew that going in as it is stated on the website. Considering it's near the airport you have to expect this. Larger hotels charge even more to park. The only complaint I had was the air freshener used in the room. It needs to be toned down quite a bit as our clothes even smelled of the scent.

Wifi didn't work at all, and when I asked about it, the front desk person said - 'sorry, maybe there's a dead spot'. Well, then - don't advertise free wifi then! We were getting an early flight, so my plan was to check-in, return my car, then get the shuttle back to the hotel. I asked the front desk person a lot of questions about the shuttle, to the point where she was getting impatient - but never did she mention that there are 2 Holiday Inn Express hotels near the airport and not to get on the shuttle that says 'Holiday Inn Express'!!!! Yes, after waiting 20 min at the airport, we got on that shuttle and were taken to the other Holiday Inn Express, 5 miles away. By now it's very late and my choice was to go back to the airport (after many more hotel stops), and wait for the 'right' shuttle, which by now I had no idea what that was. So - after a $20 cab fare, we finally got back to the hotel and a very unapologetic clerk who somehow thought I should know NOT to get on a shuttle that has Holiday Inn Express on it. Between that and the WIFI, I am totally unimpressed and will be writing a letter specifically mentioning this clerk. Breakfast looked ok, not bad for free.

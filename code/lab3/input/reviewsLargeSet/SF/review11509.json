The room was really big for SF standards (there is just so much space!) the TV was modern and worked really well (tv in the bathroom too), and there was a DVD player. The bed was comfy and met expectations..

We took the 30 bus, two blocks away, to Coit Tower, the Wharf area, Chinatown, and Little Italy. We took the 5 bus to Golden Gate park where we rented Segways from Electric Tour Company (highly recommended). Plenty of restaurant choices nearby. Since the hotel doesn't include a breakfast we tried Pinecrest Diner (one block away) the first day and loved it so much we went there every morning through our visit. This facility is part of the Shell timeshare network and they offer rooms to timeshare guests as well as standard hotel guests. When we checked in, we were directed to a timeshare salesperson; very friendly, but not so pushy that we couldn't easily say no, and we weren't approached again during our stay.\r\nThe room itself had a king bed and a queen sofabed.

He checked us in quickly and gave us information about the hotel. We also met sweet Pam who was helpful during our entire trip! The room was gorgeous - modern decor and very spacious, with a refrigerator, and an awesome TV built into the mirror, and the terrace was a pleasant surprise. We checked in the night the Giants won the World Series and we enjoyed hearing the town erupt in celebration when the winning fly ball was caught. Although we are not Giants fans, the enthusiasm was infectious. The staff told us we were only a few blocks from the celebration and told us how to get there. I am sure the celebration kept other visitors awake, but the noise was not the fault of the staff and I could not believe they were having to field complaints about the noise from hotel guests. \r\n\r\nOverall, I give the Donatello an excellent rating because of the beautiful room, amazing staff and convenient location.

Our room was clean and included a small kitchenette and a comfortable bed. The only downside about this hotel was when we arrived the concierge associate gave us our \"welcome packet\" and some information about the surrounding area (good places to eat, shop, and see). However, he then proceeded to tell us about this complimentary breakfast that he hosted and in exchange for coming to this 30-60 minute meal and filling out a short survey we would also get a $100 dollar gift card. We were skeptical, but reluctantantly agreed (mainly so we could get out the door to start sightseeing because he would not take no for an answer). We showed up to the breakfast and it turned out to be a 2 hour high pressure one on one sales pitch to buy a time share. Luckily the sales woman felt bad that we were deceived into coming and said we could still enjoy the breakfast and leave whenever we finished eating.

I had called ahead to request a \"quiet\" room. If 1005 is considered quiet, then I'd hate to stay in another area of the hotel. There was quite a lot of street noise in 1005. The room had a dressing area (closet, dresser, bench, mirror), a bathroom, then the general living/sleeping area. There was a sleeper sofa, which I didn't use as a bed, and the sofa was very comfortable. There is a kitchen area with small fridge, microwave, sink, dishes and silverware. The bed was very comfortable, sturdy mattress, and the linens were nice. The room was very nice and quite large for a \"big city\" hotel.\n\nThe hotel also has a Club level at the top of the hotel that offers coffee, tea, a smoking area outside, etc. Very nice.\n\nThe location of the hotel is right downtown, a block off of Powell. It's up 4 blocks from Market St, and it's the last \"flat\" street. One more block north starts an uphill trek. I took the BART train from the SF Airport with one suitcase, got off at the Powell station and it was very walkable to the hotel.\n\nI travel alone, a single woman. So safety is always a key factor for me. I never felt like I was in danger. However there are homeless people everywhere in the downtown area, including right outside the hotel occasionally.\n\nThis hotel is also a timeshare.

We asked to switch our room to the other side of the hotel the next night and they were very accommodating. That night we slept great! So, just a warning, try to get a room away from the loud night club. Unless of course you will be joining the people at the night club and don't care.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Redondo Beach, California","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-04-07T17:24:14Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"11509","reviewId":"17891626","photos":[],"itinId":"314902051","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Ed","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great overall","reviewText":"Great room at a reasonable price.

We've stayed at several hotels in San Francisco including the Fairmont and the Westin St. Francis and I can't say that either of those was materially a better stay than the Donatello. The room was spacious, clean, well serviced, and the club room (for coffee, tea, a paper, etc.) provided a nice way to finish up the day.

Second, a stop at the concierge desk for a promised \"welcome package\" was actually an opportunity for the hotel to try to up-sell its timeshare program. I found this shocking and insulting. Third, on a raining morning, the hotel would not call me a taxi, and after a half-hearted attempt to hail one, gave up and told me I was on my own. I ended up walking two blocks in the rain to the Hilton where the doorman gladly hailed me a cab.

The staff were, without exception, efficient and obliging, knowledgeable about their city and very friendly. The hotel is smart and clean, the rooms stylish and spacious and cleaned with beds made up every day. A comfortable sofa bed means that rooms can accommodate up to four adults. Breakfast is a happily chaotic affair (don't expect flunkeys serving everything with tongs) with very tasty continental style foods - croissants, muffins, pastries, fruit - and enough coffee to satisfy even the thirstiest.

The front desk was very helpful and courteous and we loved our room. We were on the 5th floor and while other reviews have complained about the noise on that floor we had no trouble. In fact, the lovely thing about the 5th floor is that we had our own private patio with a table and chairs and lovely succulents all around. We also thoroughly enjoyed having a little fridge and sink and other kitchen amenities. My only complaints would be that while the rest of the room was delightfully modern, the bathroom could definitely use some updating. The shower was less than stellar and I wouldn't have wanted to take a bath in the tub. However, since I don't spend much time in the bath or the shower it really wasn't that big of a deal. Also, we enjoyed the breakfast and the free coffee on the club level, but were really put off by the head concierge who treated us (for days) as if we were trying to get away with something--like a free cup of coffee. Each time we went for coffee he snootily asked for our room and made us sign in--even if we had already been up there three times. Eh, no big deal, but kind of irritating. Overall, however, this is a charming hotel close to Chinatown and all the shopping anyone could want.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"La Crosse, WI","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-03-25T17:20:33Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"11509","reviewId":"17891560","photos":[],"itinId":"266662677","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Kai","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great place in center of town","reviewText":"Staff is very attentive and the restaurants are within walking distance","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"New orleans, La","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-03-22T04:43:35Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"11509","reviewId":"17891571","photos":[],"itinId":"265027556","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"david","brandType":"Expedia","title":"good experience","reviewText":"it was a good experience except for the parking issue... never herd of a hotel charging for parking!!!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"san diego ca","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-03-20T07:24:42Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"11509","reviewId":"17891582","photos":[],"itinId":"265767901","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Gordon","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Excellent Value 1 block from Union Square","reviewText":"The Donatello is a very comfortable, smaller hotel 1 block off of Union square, close to most major theaters, shopping, and many excellent restaurants.

The spoil of our trip was the United flight we had been squashed into, we were booked on a BMI flight which was joined with lots of other companies to fill the one United Flight. The Jumbo must have been as old as the Ark, firstly we were sat separately as they had taken to many bookings for the one flight, there were no TV screens anywhere in coach so they pulled down one cloth screen at the front of the section and that was it - we were finally put together near the back of the plane so had no chance of seeing the screen without binoculars!!!! 11 hours of nothing in a cramped seat - not a pleasant start to the journey.

Since it was almost 10:00 PM and we'd showered and unpacked, we didn't want to move. He sent someone us to close the door to the banquet room (?), in hopes of keeping in the noise I guess. Well, it didn't help much, and when the banquet room emptied, all the occupants had to walk past the guest rooms to get to the elevator -- so even more noise. Honestly, though, the hotel is nice, clean and located a block from Union Square. The staff was great, too -- not their fault someone thought banquet rooms and guest rooms were a good combo.

The breakfast was basic and limited, but it was complimentary, so no complaints! In general, the staff throughout the hotel were helpful and friendly, which seems to be the norm in San Francisco. We loved it and would defnitely make a return trip.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Leamington Spa","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-09-01T09:23:49Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"11509","reviewId":"17891581","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"reem","brandType":"Expedia","title":"if i'll go back to SF i'll take this hotel","reviewText":"i like this hotel very much. the type of room is very good you'll feel like home. the hotel service is really good. the location of the hotel is good, just tow block from uonion squar(all the shops and resturant there) sorry for bad writing","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"San Diego, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-08-29T05:15:48Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"11509","reviewId":"17891598","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Wes","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great Hotel in Union Square area","reviewText":"I was pleasantly surprised with the amenities at the Donatello.

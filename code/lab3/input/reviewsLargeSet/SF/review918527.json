Picked up my bag & went downstairs & asked to be checked out due to infestation. The desk clerk whom was also doing laundry, said she would go check the room & be right back. When she came back she said there was no cockroach & the room simply \"smelled\". To which I replied the bug was dead in the waste basket & I'd like to be checked out. She offered me another room & asked if I'd accept or not. Why would I want to stay there?! She refused to check me out. I decided it wasn't worth trying to speak with her & just leave & called expedia to see if they could set me up with another hotel (mind you with was past midnight in California). After 1 hour on hold & being transferred to 4 people they were not able to do anything for me. I ended up finding a Hyatt nearby & staying there for my weekend.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":1,"ratingHotelCondition":1,"ratingService":1,"ratingRoomComfort":1,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-08-31T15:48:29Z","roomTypeId":523464,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":true,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"918527","reviewId":"57c5bd9d0457930b54dd5d82","photos":[],"itinId":"1144235291771","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[{"isFlaggable":true,"userNickname":"Manager","displayLocale":"en_us","date":"2016-09-08T19:02:19Z","id":"f2d873b5-d1e7-4678-adbd-699d47a6dcfa","response":"Thank you for sharing your experience with us.

I always bring my own non stick fry pan but they do provide a pan and pot and enough dishes for 2 people.

The rooms are always hot!  This time it was winter and the outside temperature was in the low 50's at night but the room was 74 degrees.  We had to keep the windows open so as not to use the air conditioning.  The freeway is close so that makes the road noise louder but it did not keep us awake.  When we have stayed in the hotel in summer, we had to run the A/C all the time because the temperature inside the room was unbearable.  Evidently, there is no insulation in this hotel.\r\n\r\nFor some reason the prices keep going up on the rooms and have risen a lot in the 1 1/2 years we have been coming here.

Yes you might be thinking it was some fancy memory stick that was at fault but I am both a computer engineer and a frequent traveller and I purposely travel with the simplist USB stick that is readable by almost all makes and models of computers.\n\nThe price could have been a bit better considering it was right next the 101 highway but sound insulation in the room was adequate to prevent much of seeping in from the 101.

The second room had a toxic odor, I'm guessing due to the renovation. The carpet was new and smelled like your nose in a bag full of new rubber bands. Headache kind of toxic. At that point, we just wanted to leave the location when we woke up the next day. Manager said no - that we would be charged in full for all 4 days. So we stayed. Next, my daughter's shoe went missing under the bed and when I flipped up the bedskirt, there was so much dust, someone else's socks and some trash. Next, our key cards to the new room didn't work when we came in late the next night. When I went to get coffee one of the following days, I overheard one staff member tell another (in Spanish) \"Here comes the white lady who can't leave.\" And they all had a laugh on me.

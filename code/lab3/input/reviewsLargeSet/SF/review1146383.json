There's personal fridge, widescreen hdtv, electric iron, microwave, complete set of toiletries ( mini shampoo/conditioners, bath soap, shower cap included), and complete set of fresh and clean towels. The room and bathroom were clean and presentable.  I only have three minor gripes:  1. I could hear the tv in the next room. Although not at a disturbing intensity, it can be an issue to others. The sound from my tv kind of covered over the next room's tv sound. 2. The bath tub was slow in draining, so it was partially clogged down the line somewhere. Management should make sure their cleaners need to test drainage each time. I had to stand on the top of the tub walls on the later part of my shower because I didn't want my feet to get soaked on the gray water. 3. Lacks a small table.\r\n\r\nOverall, I had a positive experience, and had a good night's sleep, on comfortable bed and pillows, and clean sheets. Most of all, for the price I got of about $110 per night, it's the place that gave me the best value for what I was looking for - just a few minutes to the Golden Gate.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Southern California","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-07-30T00:22:16Z","roomTypeId":200383585,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":true,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"1146383","reviewId":"57929bab92b3430b2979b1e7","photos":[],"itinId":"1140323943015","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"It was a nice room and clean","reviewText":"I love the staff very nice and helpful the room was clean and cozy.

Basically, the idea was to upgrade the room with new furnishings and fixtures. But the exposed exterior screws, wall panel, and legacy commode showed a lack of care. Also, we had no lock on the first floor bathroom. It looked like there had been a lock at some time, but it was removed for some unknown reason. There was an ironing board and wall mount for the iron, but no iron. I assume the iron was lost with the lock in the land of misfit repairs. finally, the nice new bathroom faucet was mounted improperly and consequently wobbled like a deformed bobble head. Since the pile of rubble and garbage was outside the room, and piled behind a nice new wall, I could almost ignore it, if it wasn't for the 50 gallon drums protruding above the pile and 1/2 wall.

If you are planning to visit Muir woods area this is a good place. Very spacious room with walk-in closet!!!! Heater in the room, no AC though. Good restaurants around. The location is ideal for travelers being bang on 101. Surprisingly very nice sound proof rooms. Breakfast needs a lot of improvements - Juice was diluted to an extent that it tasted like nothing, no bread/toast just some bearclaws and coffee.\nPlenty of parking available and free WiFi.\nWe were 3 adults in a room and they didn't charge extra for additional person.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Sunnyvale, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2013-02-18T18:54:47Z","roomTypeId":378080,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Families","categoryLabel":"Families"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"1146383","reviewId":"37363701","photos":[],"itinId":"148854531130","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":1,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Look elsewhere!","reviewText":"Horribly outdated and rundown.

I had to move a table from the room into the bathroom to put all of our bathroom stuff (me / wife / 2 kids). There were no towels anywhere to be found. When I went to the front desk to talk about the room, she said she could move us to a better room; I told her the kids were already changed for bed, and if she had a better room, why didn't she put us in there in the first place? The towels she gave us were warm, probably just out of the dryer? But they had stains all over them ... gross! The water pressure in the shower was appalling. You could hear every noise from the rooms next to us, and when the people walked in the room above us it was like an earthquake. The \"breakfast\" provided was a 1 X 1 shelf in the tiny front desk area with coffee and muffins or something like that; we didn't bother going and found a local family friendly restaurant instead.

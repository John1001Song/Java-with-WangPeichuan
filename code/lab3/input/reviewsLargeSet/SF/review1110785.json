I said that it was nice to be upgraded but that it should be in the size bed that was requested in the original reservation.  I was then moved to a regular king sized room however this room was made for a special needs individual.  Again we did not ask for this type of room at the time of booking.  They clearly had rented out the other king sized rooms and put us in whatever they had even though we had made our reservation 6 weeks ago.

They did have three waffle irons for fresh made waffles.  Plenty of sliced and diced fruit and hot oatmeal.  Four different juice options and hot coffee. Their breakfast is nowhere as good as one's done by Embassy Suites, but it wasn't horrible either.   I just stayed away from the items one needed to zap in the microwave.    The breakfast dinning area is also small and congested.  Overall their breakfast was OK, but that is a good thing as I didn't overeat.    \r\n\r\nOur room was extremely clean and spacious.  Beds were a bit small but comfortable.  They could have placed another bed or sofa couch in there to occupy the open \"dead\" space as the room had too much un-utilized space.  I recommend that they replace the their double sized beds with queens or king sized ones.

I usually do not post reviews but I feel I need to because this hotel was excellent. First, let me say that I am a \"clean freak\" and very picky with hotels. etc. It was my first visit to the San Francisco area and my husband's second. We flew into San Diego to attend my nephew's wedding and then drove up the coast, stayed 1 night in an average Quality Inn along the way, and then planted ourselves in this gem about 20 minutes south of San Francisco. The hotel was beautiful -  nice furniture, clean beyond clean, comfortable king size bed, free breakfast, and a very friendly and helpful staff. The price wasn't bad either considering the location. SF hotels in general are expensive so we thought this was moderately priced. It was close to the airport and Rt. 101. So a quick ride up the road to the entrance of the Rt. 101 Freeway took us quickly to the city, which we both enjoyed visiting!

If you like to leave the bathroom light on at night with the bathroom door ajar like I do for visibility when you have to get up in the middle of the night, you are out of luck.  You either have to leave a light on in the room or get up in pitch darkness, neither of which seems like a good choice to me.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"Hotel condition and staff.","negativeRemarks":"The motion activated lights and automatically closing doors need to be eliminated.","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Texas","reviewSubmissionTime":"2015-12-02T18:12:10Z","roomTypeId":50400,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"4","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_ca","totalThanks":1,"hotelId":"1110785","reviewId":"565dd2305ec9ff09545d6cb6","photos":[],"itinId":"1118276030277","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"HMP MMD","managementResponses":[{"isFlaggable":false,"userNickname":"Brian","displayLocale":"en_gb","date":"2015-12-09T21:00:24Z","id":"3709327b-6b9a-4570-896a-85d346d1a330","response":"Thank you, Harvey, for your repeat business.

If traveling to downtown-it's easier/cheaper to take the BART at Milbrae Station to Powell St-you can access the BART near the Fairfield Inn if you take the shuttle it's only 2 blocks away from the station (you can't walk to Milbrae Station). As far as restaurants near the hotel-I ate at the Elephant Bar (you will have a choice of everything-great atmosphere). If interested in site seeing-I used City Sight Seeing Tour Company-great views on the double decker bus -package was $104 for 72 hrs. which included everything and  a tour of Alcatraz (you must make reservations for Alcatraz-it sells out very fast).

When we made the reservation, I asked that our room be close to my mothers and we were given adjoining rooms, which was really nice.  We were right next to the elevator and we never heard any noise.  The beds were very comfortable and the sheets were very soft.  When we checked in, Vivian (I think that was her name) was very helpful and provided us with the airport shuttle schedule.  The next day, she called over to the Elephant Bar and put our name on the list.  She was very nice.  My only complaint was the breakfast.  I didn't like that everything had to be microwaved.  At one point, my husband went to make a waffle and the waffle machine broke in his hand.  He stood with batter all over his hands, trying to keep more of it from going onto the floor.  I asked the employee in the kitchen area for help and she looked at him and then very slowly went over and found a rag and then very slowly came back and helped him with the batter.  Didn't ruin our day, but it did put a damper on the beginning of it.

We stayed at a Hilton Hotel the first time. It was nice, but more expensive, no free wi-fi, no free breakfast and we certainly didn't get the same view we received at the Bay Landing. The Bay Landing Hotel is downright beautiful. I thought for the amount we were paying that we weren't going to get the same amount of luxury, but I was dead wrong. We upgraded to a Bayside view when we got in (20 extra per day) and when we got the room we were invited by a glorious view. It was so nice to wake up to the nice breeze and it set the mood for a good day. Yes the airport is right across from the bay, but in all honesty the double window panes pretty much blocked out any noise and we got sound sleep all three nights we stayed there. The staff is amazing, they helped us out throughout our trip with information and we always came back to a made up room after a long day. The free breakfast in the morning isn't the most top notch breakfast of all time, but it's FREE. They have the typical waffler makers and omelettes, and of course toast and muffins. They have juice and coffee in the morning as well and serve coffee all day to guests (found this to be VERY helpful). They even had cookies out at night for guests coming back in :) Everything was clean in the hotel, no shoddiness of any kind and the surrounding neighborhood is quiet and peaceful if you wanted to take a walk along the bay.

I called ahead because i had purchased a park and fly package on Expedia. The hotel clerk assured me that everything was fine. I asked if we could have a second car since there were two of us staying in the room and we were coming from different places. The clerk said that would be fine (which i thought was surprising, but generous and accommodating). When i check in, i confirmed with the desk clerk again -- there will be another person coming with another car for the park and fly package. She said that would not be a problem. BUT, when my daughter arrived, the desk clerk had changed and he said that she could not have a park and fly pass, and that even the original reservation was not a park and fly. He did not want to give either of us parking passes and was insistent that despite two other employees assuring us that it was all ok, that we did not have a park and fly package. Finally, he gave us the passes, but would not give me a receipt for my credit card because he said they might charge me more for the parking. I still have to call the manager to figure this all out.

In this case the bathroom was spotless and the products for guest use were quite scrummy. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to others and will definitely be staying here again.\n\nA big bonus for in transit passengers like myself was the free airport shuttle and the fact the hotel is only 5 minutes from the airport.

The bed in the hotel was a real bed with posts -- quite a change from the usual rectangle of wood nailed to the wall, to look like a headboard. Internet access worked like a charm without having to fight with an external service that required changing network settings, as I've had to do in a couple Bay Area hotels in the recent past. The hotel's hallways are wide, so if you're the sort who doesn't like long cramped hallways, you'd like these better than average, I think. I have a thing about clean air -- no smoke residue or mold/mildew -- in hotels, and the Bay Landing SFO airport hotel gets 5 stars on that. The only thing that detracted from the feel of the room was a \"tube\" rather than LCD/plasma TV screen, but really that's a small quibble about a room that honestly most airport hotels are not going to be able to match. Clean, new, nice overall. I put a good word in for this hotel with my SF-based colleague, in case anyone asks him for an airport hotel recommendation in the future.\n\nIn the morning, it was great to grab a cup of Chex and a couple blueberry muffins for a breakfast on the go in the shuttle van, from the complimentary continental breakfast buffet.

The only things you need to be aware of is there is no restaurant in the hotel so you might need to take a drive or walk to get dinner.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Ottawa","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-09-08T18:33:27Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Andrew","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"1110785","reviewId":"17475009","photos":[],"itinId":"334126627","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Glen","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Will be back again","reviewText":"From the moment we arrived everything was as expected. we were greeted promptly at the check in desk.

The hotel was very clean and a very quiet neighbourhood. My husband and I stayed there for three nights. A shuttle bus comes and takes you to the airport which takes under 10 minutes and then we took the rapid transit (BART) into San Francisco which took about 30 mins. There was free parking, wifi and a great free breakfast with the greatest tasting waffles. Downtown San Francisco is so busy and loud we enjoyed coming back to our little piece of heaven. There was a walkway behind the hotel that gave you a great walk around the bay and you could see sailboats and airplanes come in. You never heard the airplanes even tho you could see the airport from the hotel. The staff seemed tired and overwhelmed as they had just booked in a family reunion. I would highly recommend this hotel. Great maid service. For restaurants in the area the Elephant bar was great, but be prepared for a wait and it is quite noicey, but great food and views to the Bay are well worth it.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Burnaby, BC Canada","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-08-17T19:13:06Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"1110785","reviewId":"17475644","photos":[],"itinId":"332546898","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Jay","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great Choice","reviewText":"Bay Landing was the perfect choice for me.

The suite included a second sink and vanity area which was helpful when three people are trying to get ready to head out in the morning. The hotel is very close to the airport and convenient to restaurants (Elephant Bar was good). The free breakfast was satisfying and was replenished frequently (started at 6:00 AM weekdays). The BART was 1.3 miles away and not a bad walk. The shuttle to and from the airport was prompt both times we used it. The lobby area is comfortable with several sitting areas, a large TV, and a computer and printer for guests to use. I also used the guest laundry which was inexpensive compared to most hotels. This was a nice airport hotel and worked well for our very late arrival from the east coast and early morning departure to return home.

There's a self service area where you can get snacks and frozen food, so even if you're jetlagged you can get some sort of meal at any hour.\n\nThe bed was comfortable.

Water temperature was good and pressure was fine, though I think my shower head needed to be cleaned since the pulse setting wasn't all that pulsating anymore.\n\nBreakfast was included. There were choices for pretty much every dietary need. Nothing cooked to order, but you could make your own waffles if you wanted to.\n\nThere are at least two nice restaurants just on the other side of the parking lot, within EASY walking distance. The neighborhood is all hotels and airport services, so if you're looking for a fun location this isn't it. But it's close to the highway and airport.\n\nA clean, comfortable, and pleasant place to stay.

Close to restaurants and grocery stores. 2 minutes away from the freeway and 20 minutes to Fisherman's Wharf. Will consider this hotel again in the future.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Vancouver B.C.","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-11-05T07:13:36Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Yeung Family","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"1110785","reviewId":"17475044","photos":[],"itinId":"298169861","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Jacquie","brandType":"Expedia","title":"\"Excellent Choice!\"","reviewText":"We thoroughly enjoyed the Bay Landing San Francisco hotel and ended up staying for five days.

First, I recommend getting a room on the top floor as the noise from the doors and bathroom from the room above us actually woke us up (mostly from the doors). Secondly, if you are planning on utilizing the complimentary breakfast, don't expect much. The fruit was old, the only choice of bread (bagels included) was \"White\"... no wheat, rye, whole-grain etc. and the \"eggs\" advertised are ONLY hard-boiled .. and not very well, at that.

The only issue we had was with the reception staff; although very friendly and business-like they were not all that helpful with directions.

This was somewhat discerning, however the front desk staff made up for it by providing us with a bay front hotel room. It was absolutely beautiful!

We will definately stay here the next time we are in the city.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"San Diego","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-07-10T00:25:29Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"1110785","reviewId":"17475586","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Martin","brandType":"Expedia","title":"great hotel","reviewText":"very quiet for being 2-3 miles from airport, good breadfast, would come back for the price","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Los Angeles, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-07-09T17:13:10Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"1110785","reviewId":"17475590","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Meegan","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great Place To Stay!","reviewText":"For the price the Bay Landing Airport Hotel was great.

The overall appearance and presentation from the moment you walk in, to the time you open your room door is very warm, friendly and upscale! Very, very clean and neat place to stay. The Continental Breakfast is also better than many, with a wide variety of items from which to choose--even freshly cooked waffles! One drawback, though, is that there was no pool. Not the least of our worries, at least on this trip. The walk-in shower is really nice, but the tiles can become slippery when wet...how about changing to tiles with a rougher surface, or at least putting in some anti-slip treatment?

The staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel lacks a bar or restaurant, although there are 5 or 6 restaurants within 5 minutes walk. The buffet breakfast was very comprehensive, and constantly replenished; although the space allocated for tables was limited at busy times. Very conveniently located for the airport (5 mins drive) with a shuttle bus service if required. The double glazing was most effective at keeping plane noise out,whilst allowing you to watch planes landing. Views over the Bay, and the bayside walk, added to the ambience. The hotel is located approximately 30-45 minutes drive from Fishermans Wharf, which gave the opportunity to escape the tourist centre for a more tranquil setting. Overall, at Expedia rates, this hotel offers excellent value for money, and should be seriously considered by anyone looking for a modern hotel in the South San Francisco area.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Nottinghamshire","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-11-01T22:03:28Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"4","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_ca","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"1110785","reviewId":"17475080","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"4105","userNickname":"Scott","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Good Value","reviewText":"Great hotel for the price.

The things I did not like was that, even though there is a kitchenette, there is not adequate garbage cans in the room. There were 2-2 gallon cans, and if you make a meal in your room they fill up quickly. It got to the point later on in our stay that we had ants coming in the room.

I called downstairs to see when the shuttle ran and was told it runs \"every half hour, on the half hour\" until noon, then you need to call and schedule a pickup time after that. I had Raider tickets for 1pm in Oakland so I went downstairs at 11:15 to catch the 11:30 shuttle then was told it needed to be called in and he would not make it back by 11:30 but she would have him come at noon. The shuttle didn't arrive until 12:40 so I missed the first quarter of the game and the girl at the front desk couldn't have cared less.

Unfortunately, by the time we got to the domestic terminal (at SFO) he was saying the same thing to the people waiting there. I'm sure this was an effect of the sick driver and my return trip to the airport the next day was fine. When I arrived at the hotel the check-in was fast and efficient but not overly friendly. However, the room was pretty big and very clean and the bed was comfortable. Breakfast was good with great waffles. I had a room facing the road but could not hear any traffic noise day or night.

The hotel is meticulously maintained and the staff was extraordinarily friendly. Parking is free, unlike many of the nearby hotels.

Guests frequently sit on the back patio of the hotel sipping coffee or wine and enjoying the bay breeze. There is a computer with internet access in the lobby, available free to guests, which comes in handy for getting directions or making reservations. The manager often wanders among guests at breakfast (breakfast is included in room price) to make sure everything is fine.

There is an area where you can purchase snacks and toiletry items 24-hours a day. There is a large exercise room, with a good variety of modern, high-quality machines. The continental breakfast is nice, with a good assortment of fruit, yogurt, pastries, juices, and belgian waffles. The rooms themselves are comfortable. The beds are particularly nice. Some of the rooms have super-sized bathrooms. My only complaint....a minor one....is that the bathroom door will not stay open---it closes automatically as if on a spring.

Remarkably it was quiet, since hotel is not in the path of any runway; several good restaurants within walking distance; pathway along the bay for jogging; not too noisy street. Hotel: Even though it is supposed to be a cheap imitation, hotel looks kind of like a European castle outside; inside, expensive wallpaper and wooden bars give it a French country look. Very pleasant veranda with tables and bay views. Room: One of the nicest rooms I have been in this country. Clean, light, functional. Again wallpaper, expensive carpet, European feel. Amenities: TV, safe, fridge, window that opens, curtains with no leaking light, microwave, 2 phones with speakerphone, AC with remote control, laundry ($1.50 + $1 for dryer), free wired internet (with data cable already in the room). Service: Great service. Mainly because I saw staff twice during my stay: at check in and check out time. Everything worked, was well though out, and with you in mind (kind of like when you stay at friends house).","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Washington, DC","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-07-14T17:45:36Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"1110785","reviewId":"17474980","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Anne","brandType":"Expedia","title":"A Real Treasure","reviewText":"This is one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed in. It is beautifully appointed, immaculate, and the staff is extremely helpful. Unlike the big chain hotels, you feel like you're in an exclusive boutique property. The view is gorgeous, the rooms are spacious, and the buffet breakfast is outstanding with juices, fruit, yogurt, waffles, hard boiled eggs, cereals, and an assortment of breads and pastries; all included in the price of the room. There is a shuttle service from the airport that runs every half hour. You couldn't ask for a nicer place to stay in the Bay Area.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Westlake Village, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-05-11T02:43:07Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]}]}}}

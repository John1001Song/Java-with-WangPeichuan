The bed was enormously wide. Room furniture was good and in keeping with the period feel of the hotel. I suppose that the biggest drawback is the lack of breakfast and although the hotel has a connecting restaurant we were never asked to dine there. Instead, we took all of our meal's at outside establishments - there's a great Lori's diner just around the corner. Back at the hotel, late afternoon tea and sherry in the Lobby was most welcome. And early morning coffee was available on two of the higher floors. In room coffee-making facilities were replenished every day. Our bathroom had a large walk-in shower and we were provided with lots of toiletries. All in all, it was a great place for two 60 year olds to stay, close to all of the action, transport links and the Cheesecake Factory in Macy's.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"The sherry!

Luckily, my bank was able to get involved and get things started.  Once I put this in place, all the manager needed to do was send a fax that I was told would be sent in 20 minutes.  4 hours later, my bank called and informed me that they hadn't received the fax.  At this point, I'm at a very nice restaurant having my birthday dinner.  I called the hotel and the manager had left for the day and the person at the front desk told me she was left to send the fax but didn't know how to work the fax machine.  Needless to say, I was pretty upset. After some back and forth, she finally admitted that she didn't have the correct fax number and told me she couldn't help me and then asked me if there was anything else she could do for me.  When I laughed at this, she told me she had a customer and hung up.  I did get the correct fax number from my bank, called her back and she suddenly knew how to use the fax machine.

The first night, there were a lot of noise from the street (traffic and jazz music) so we requested a couple of pairs of ear plugs. The following morning, we opened the window because the room got really hot but when we tried to close it later, the window wouldn't close. The front desk sent us someone who merely closed the window shut with force. We never tried to open the window afterwards. The good thing was that I was able to close the window completely and the noise from the street was greatly minimized on subsequent nights. The hotel is old, the standard room is small and could use some updates and minor fixing (like the window and bathroom tiles) but it's half a block from Union Square, which make it an ideal stay for someone who isn't going to spend a lot of time at the hotel.

Parking is an extra $40 - 45/ for a 24 hour period. This includes as many in and outs as you want. You never see the valet, so there is no tipping. Price includes all. I thought this wouldn't work well, but it did. There are cheaper parking around, but they do not include the in and out option. Ask for room 78.

I did have some very minor issues, and brought none to the attention of the staff as I personally didn't feel the need. I mention them only for those who might find them more of a problem than I did. First, I could not get the control for the heater to turn the heat down, so the room was very warm unless I kept the window open. Since the weather was lovely (no rain) and the room was located high enough that no one could come in the room that way, I adjusted the room temperature via the window. Second, if you plan on having to spend any time in the room watching TV, don't bother; there are limited, which means no, interesting channels unless you want to pay for movies. Finally, the bed is very very firm, and while I like firm beds, by the end of my four night stay, I was wishing for a little more give in that mattress.

This made the room quite comfortable during our stay, when the temperatures were in the high 70's during they day and the mid-50's at night. The bed was really comfortable and the toiletries were excellent (Terre Pure). There were a closet with lots of hangers, a spacious dresser, two side tables, and a desk in the room. The only thing I felt we were missing was bathrobes. Other than the comfortable beds, the best thing about the hotel is the location. It's less than one block to Union Square and it's very close (walking distance) to many of the tourist attractions in SF. It's also about 2-3 blocks to the metro stop and about 1 block to the cable car stop. There are numerous restaurants/cafes and lots of shopping in the area, too. The room was a reasonable size for SF. Overall, we were satisfied and would consider staying here again if the price and weather were similar.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Austin, TX","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-09-08T18:20:05Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"17616","reviewId":"17519152","photos":[],"itinId":"326026139","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Winnie","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Overall it's ok, but I will not stay there again.","reviewText":"Convenient location.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Hong Kong","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-08-27T02:32:14Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Families","categoryLabel":"Families"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"17616","reviewId":"17519129","photos":[],"itinId":"322558423","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":2,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Joseph","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Dissappointing experience","reviewText":"The staff was polite and accommodating but the stay was not pleasant.

The paintings are wonderful and the old-style feel is nice. The staff are quite friendly and helpful. Note: There are no in-room safes and you cannot give a laptop to the front desk. Just keep this in mind, the safe-keeping boxes are small. They can accept small things like jewelry. Also, the valet service is a 3rd party, which parks offsite. The desk asks that you give them 20 minutes to retrieve your vehicle. The valet was pretty quick in my experience, not taking more than 10 minutes to get my car. I strongly suggest not having a car, unless you drive in to the city like I did. Public Transport in SF is fantastic - coverage, price and convenience.

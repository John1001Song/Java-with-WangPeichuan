I had prior arrangements to have wine sent up the the room. When i arrived i was greeted by a younger gal who seemed whatever about the job as well as the boy working with her. Not sure if they were having a off day, but i could've done without their attitude especially if I'm paying a hefty dime a night and this is my first time in SF. So i get to the room and its a pretty old looking room that they just added wall paper to and left the popcorn ceilings. It was neither a luxurious nor relaxing type of room. Its far away from most things like fishermans wharf or union square and the golden gate bridge. Anyhow my wine was not in the room when  i arrived so i went back down to ask for it and the girl seemed annoyed that i would ask. Then she called up her manager saying pretty much that this lady is asking for wine and hung up and looked at me and told me that it'll be a big charge. I was really upset and told her a wonderful woman who i spoke to prior to arriving had set everything up. Then finally after more calling she had our things ready for us when we got back from the Aquarium. This place for the price should have better staffing especially for the price i paid. I could have gotten a room at the W or the Clift and been more relaxed with better sheets and staffing. Ive been to japan and it felt nothing like japan. i wouldn't recommend this place. Also no room service, restaurant or bar/fridge.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"only japan town","lastInitial":"B","userLocation":"Seattle, WA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-05-17T20:26:43Z","roomTypeId":200711245,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":true,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"1003","reviewId":"573b20ee900e6a09f99b1493","photos":[],"itinId":"1132767948058","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[{"isFlaggable":true,"userNickname":"Hotel Manager","displayLocale":"en_us","date":"2016-05-19T02:18:47Z","id":"9682df1e-7fa3-4f58-839c-3c4d50a4a0d8","response":"We're sincerely sorry for the maintenance concerns with your respective room and for any inconvenience.

There were no other signs of a renovation occurring.  The lobby and room were very clean and appealing, and we had an amazing view from the 16th floor.  Yes, there was some street noise, as can be expected in the middle of a big city but it didn't keep me awake.  We booked a corner tower room and were pleased with the large kabuki panels that slid shut at night in lieu of curtains.  The soaking tub was great.  We did not have any trouble finding the refrigerator or mugs for the coffee maker, as did other guests.  Garage access was excellent and cheap for SF ($23) although no in and out privileges unless you do valet parking for $45.  The garage is well lit and extremely clean, and we felt comfortable keeping what we purchased in the trunk of the car overnight.  Three things can be improved upon:  there is no door to the washbasin and shower area, only to the toilet stall.  Thus, in the middle of the night, the light from the bathroom pours out into the bedroom.  The other is that no matter how many times we thought we had adjusted our room thermostat, the room remained at an overheated 72.  Finally, we had some very loud foreigners in the room next door, and we thought the walls were too thin for this price point.  However, we would definitely stay here again for easy access to Japantown.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Pacific Grove, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-01-13T22:57:48Z","roomTypeId":200711244,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":true,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"1003","reviewId":"568ab21f710ec75925da52fa","photos":[],"itinId":"1122655457507","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[{"isFlaggable":true,"userNickname":"Hotel Manager","displayLocale":"en_us","date":"2016-01-05T23:17:54Z","id":"88e811a7-5049-40da-9b2c-60004dd65061","response":"We're pleased to have complemented your explorations so perfectly and to hear you enjoyed your time spent in our company.

The room was clean, and the bed was comfortable.  A definite bonus was the view that I got in my 15th flr room; watching the day break over the city and the sun set on the Bay (I could see a sliver of the water) on my balcony was delightful.  As was the sake-tasting in the lobby on Friday afternoon. \r\n\r\nThe location, Japantown, is excellent.

Upon check in I was given the wrong room, it was supposed to have the soaking tub but didn’t, at first the front desk person argued that my room did have the tub but after a short conversation he realized his mistake and quickly corrected it. He told me the number of my new room but when I got there the key wouldn’t open the door; however the guest in that room did, oops! Front desk transposed the number when he told me, the right number was written on the key envelope. No biggie. The Hotel was nicely decorated with its own access to the Japanese mall. Parking was easy with a public parking garage right below the hotel and a dedicated elevator. The room was a bit small, nothing really special but very nicely decorated. The soaking tub was nice and functional. My room had good city views and a distant partial view of the Golden Gate. They have an unexpected and very nicely manicured Japanese garden and Koi pond nestled in between the buildings. And hey! I found out I like Sake they have a complimentary Sake tasting hour from 4-5. Nice touch. Over all I think the place is a bit over priced. I booked through Expedia for $199 which was cheaper than the regular hotel rate. It seems a bit steep for a mid-week rate one night stay (Tuesday night.) But hey! I was there on business so the company picked up the tab!

The bathroom needs redesign, as there is a too-small deep soaking tub and a shower outside the tub, which results in water getting all over the floor.  There are sliding doors across the windows, but they are difficult to maneuver.  Our room was quiet, however, and the staff was very pleasant.

The room could definitely use some refreshing as far as decor and ambience goes, but overall we had a nice stay. The biggest complaint I have is the street traffic noise occasionally heard in our room, and I suppose that is out of the hotel's hands. \r\nThe hotel is also relatively central to the city, so most attractions are just a quick ride or nice walk away. There are a lot of great shops and eateries in the surrounding Japantown, which were fun to explore. We didn't rent a car, seeing as parking was something like $45/night, and decided to Uber everywhere, which was perfect and way more affordable (most fares were under $10). Definitely recommend that!

My husband's workplace gave us a credit there for dinner, and as we'd spent all week eating amazing authentic Japanese food in the Japan Center we were expecting something special.

Also, I was not aware that our balcony was shared..so if your balcony door was open for fresh air at night, your room was open for your neighbours to come in! The air quality was very poor- no circulation or cool air coming in, hence us having the balcony door open....the end result was that our room smelled like fried foods, cigarettes and pot by morning!\nI called Expedia to report our complaints and then spoke with the Hotel Manager that morning. He was very polite and tried to help but the only option was to move us to a family suite, which would have given us two rooms- one with a King size bed and an adjoining room with two tatame mats on the floor. Really? Not an acceptable option for accomodating four adults! We ended leaving the hotel after one night and moving to the Westin at considerable cost to us.\nThis hotel should NOT book rooms for four adults....they do NOT have acceptable rooms for more than two adult travelers.\nOn another note- the lobby of the hotel is very nice but the rooms show their age, with flaking paint, banged up walls and poor air quality.

There was always someone really helpful at the front desk, they directed us to everything from perfect restaurants to the buses we needed to take. The room was clean and simple. The soaking tub was just a regular tub that was a little bit deeper than usual. The traffic outside was noisy and constant, since it is in between two main roads. I recommend a room higher up. I think the biggest disappointment was that we upgraded to a room with \"a private patio\" and sacrificed being higher up (where you share a patio) to have our own. Turns out the patio is just a sliding door with a footstep of a concrete square outside. No room for chairs or relaxing, just room enough to step outside and back in. The other negative was that it wasn't near a BART station so our plan to ride the BART into town from the airport ended up in a 2 mile uphill walk through not the nicest, optimistic parts of town.\n\nWe got a good price and are pleased with the experience, but not wowed and will probably look elsewhere for luxury next time we are in San Fran.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"The front desk staff offered really helpful dinner suggestions and traveling recommendations","negativeRemarks":"The patio was not a patio and the traffic was loud","locationRemarks":"Not BART accessible, but good restaurants within walking distance and buses give easy access to the rest of the city","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Alexandria, VA, USA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2012-02-25T04:42:09Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Becca","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"hotelId":"1003","reviewId":"24864513","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Roger","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Nice, pleasant hotel in Japantown","reviewText":"We spent 4 nights at Kabuki and we were very pleased with this hotel.

Overall, the look and atmosphere of the hotel is nice and cute as a Japanese boutique hotel. We read about the recent renovations of the hotel through some of the reviews, so we were excited that we were going to get a nice room. First impression of the room, however, was just harbringer of bad things to come. The key card entrance was so beat up, it looked like it bore witness to WWII. The room itself, though spacious and clean, appeared like it was from the 1970's. Things continued to go downhill. First, the air conditioning system appeared from the 1950's. It was so old, that we couldn't at first figure it out and thought it was broken (it wasn't). The telephone didn't work initially (maintenance came and quickly fixed it - cord was not plugged in correctly). The last night we stayed, there was a big leak from the ceiling of our room (there was heavy rain), which prompted us to change rooms in the middle of the night (we received 2 free breakfast tickets for this inconvenience). The new one was much nicer...likely one of the newly renovated ones.

The windows of my refurbished king room were filthy and the room could hardly be described as a king size. It was vastly overpriced for what it was and I have never been disappointed with booking thru expedia who I rate highly, but this was not a great hotel.

I did think the room condition is just only slightly dated, which did not distract from being comfortable. The bathroom consisted of 3 separate areas, which is nice! The toilet has it's own door, and the bath area has got a Japanese-style bath fronted a large washing/shower. Other than the bed, we were unable to use the bar fridge, which was locked and I felt the power outlets could have been more conveniently located. And no we didn't bother to ask them to unlock the fridge, we just used the small balcony, hanging our stuff in a plastic bag on the door handle. And the small balcony area was filthy! Since we had no use for it, we made no complaint. The hotel is smack in the middle of Japan Town, not very lively at this time of the year (Christmas).

The main street nearby, named Geary, is wide open at night, so these particular riders like to floor it. The front desk is generally willing to help you. Guests seem friendly and classy on average.

We travel with a car with our two year old son so the underground shopping center parking with the elevator directly to the hotel room is a bonus, especially unloading our ever increasing luggage pile. Something we haven't found in other more central San Fran hotels. The only draw back is no in/out privileges so it can get expensive. However if you are needing to save a few bucks and overnight and during the day (2hr) free parking can be found on the local streets, but be careful you don't park on the side with the early street cleaning. If not travelling by car Union Square is only a $7 taxi or short bus ride down Geary, you could always walk if the weather is nice.

The Continental breakfast was excellent.\n\nThe rooms, however, were a disappointment. Everything had a slight musty smell, which is consistent with the fog, but made the part of the hotel where the rooms are just smell old. The hotel advertises recent renovation, which is obviously true for the public areas. The rooms have been given some cosmetic upgrades, but they still seem dated and run down.

Although we booked a corner room, we ended up with a standard king room with a view, which ended up being a fine room, considering it was ready several hours before check-in. The Japanese decor in the room was a nice change from standard hotel rooms and the sliding glass door opening to the balcony was great at night - I love to have fresh air when I sleep rather than the standard air conditioning found in most hotels. Japantown is a great, quiet neighborhood for sleeping and we didn't hear our neighbors within the hotel at all during our stay. As others have suggested, skip the breakfast buffet - $18 per person is ridiculous for such average fare. We did enjoy happy hour in the bar however, as the prices and service were great.

Japantown is a quiet and clean part of town, with none of the aggressive homeless people you have to deal with in other parts of town. So, it's relatively safe to walk around at night. In addition, you're surrounded by some excellent shops and restaurants, so you don't have to really leave the area to eat. The room that I stayed in was very nice. I loved the shoji sliding screen window accents and the wooden black-out panels. The separate shower and soaking tub was very reminiscent of my stay in Japan. The hotel service was good for the most part, though they seem to employ the better doormen on the weekends. The daytime weekday guy was pretty apathetic. The hotel is in an aging edifice, and that much is evident if you look too closely, but it is clean, and the decor makes up for it. Frankly, if you're taking advantage of all of the tourist opportunities in San Francisco, you won't be in your room much anyway. ... The interior Japanese garden was lovely. You're just a 5 minute cab ride to just about anything in San Francisco (The Embarcadero, Union Square, the ball park, etc.), so Hotel Kabuki is convenient too.

We had a corner king deluxe room on the 14th floor which they upgraded us to for free and provided more then enough space for the two of us. Also, being on the 14th floor provided a great view towards to the water. Central to everything- less then a 10 cab ride to fishermans wharf and most of the main attractions. Had a great time in SF and met cool people and the lounge. Try the spicy fries! Loved it and wish we were still there!

The hotel is part of the Joie de Vivre group of independent hotels. I have stayed at 3 of their locations in the SF Bay Area and have found each to be refreshing, unique, a bit upscale, and, with Expedia's special rates, excellent values. Our room at The Kabuki (formerly the Miyako) in San Francisco was very nicely furnished, with a light and airy feel. The King/jacuzzi room felt large, very comfortable. The bed had the adjustable firmness Sleep Number mattress. The iPod clock-radio was also a nice perk. On the minus side, wi-fi reception was very weak in the room, although you can ask the front desk for a repeater (amplifier) that fixes the problem. As in nearly all places in SF, the streets are congested and parking can be an issue. Hotel parking is in the Japantown center's lot under the hotel and is often crowded, but cost less than half of what you would pay to park at most hotels in SF. If your business or leisure takes you to this part of town, I highly recommend The Kabuki Hotel.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Redding, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-01-14T18:42:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"1003","reviewId":"17978928","photos":[],"itinId":"258345372","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Marian","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Very good location.

Our breakfast always tended to be in the hotel where western options were available but this was probably more expensive than if we'd been able to visit a diner. The area surrounding the hotel was nice but it took us 25 mins (possibly just over a mile) to walk down (well up and down!) to Union Square, so it is not in a very central location for tourists. Bus service was good, especially on Geary Street. The hotel was as we expected. The rooms are nicely done out with Japanese screens and we had a Japanese bath which was nice to try out. Good TV and stereo with adaptable ipod docking which will charge your ipod or an alternative cable for other mp3 players. Some noise was heard from people in the corridors and from the roadworks which set up the night we arrived, but it was not too much of a problem. There were signs of wear and tear in the corridor but nothing too bad.

In addition to shopping and restaurants, Japan Town has a number of interesting plaques in the 9-12 square historical blocks surrounding the hotel.

Amenities in the hotel were great with Aveda products in the bathroom, an ipod station in the room, wireless internet access and a wine reception every day. If you ask the hotel, they will provide a refrigerator in your room - cold milk for cereal and coffee and cold white wine in our room made it very nice. The location in Japan town is great - you are away from the bustle of 'downtown' but only a few minutes away in a taxi or on a bus.

Nice area.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Philadelphia","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-01-18T02:00:03Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]}]}}}

One peculiar item... the ice machine is on the lobby level, so don't don night clothes before obtaining ice!  Neighborhood safe and busy at night.  Bedroom window opens and great city view.  Only one night was there any noise problem and that was the garbage truck.  Very convenient to the fabulous public transportation system. Around the corner from the Sir Francis Drake Hotel.  I have already recommended to others and will stay there again.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Bend OR","reviewSubmissionTime":"2004-11-18T22:33:12Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"hotelId":"1694","reviewId":"20255902","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Gilberto","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Good Place to stay in San Francisco","reviewText":"It's a nice hotel, and is in a good spot.\nService is  Good and the restaurant is great.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Hermosillo, Sonora Mexico","reviewSubmissionTime":"2004-11-08T14:20:19Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"1694","reviewId":"20255899","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Brad","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Don't understand \"Review Title\".","reviewText":"Only one OLD ice machine for the hotel.

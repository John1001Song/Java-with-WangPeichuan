The hallways/elevators had a rustic feel to them, which, in my mind, let me know this building has some history behind it. All-wood floors, so if you don't like creaky floors then be advised. All-in-all, the rooms were clean, cozy, and great for an on-the-go tourist. When you needed to come in from your long day of walking & spending money, your room awaits for some TV watching, and winding down.

This is a really old hotel.  The floors are really squeaky!  They were so squeaky that I was afraid that I might wake up guests in the neighbouring rooms (because I'm a night owl!).  So this leads to my biggest complaint about this hotel; you can hear right into the next guest room clear as if there were no wall between you.  My room had the locked doorway between adjoining rooms, and I could hear my neighbour VERY easily.  I could hear his telephone conversation like he was in the same room as me;  I could also hear him snoring at night.  No doubt the hotel is very aware of this since they provide you with earplugs.\r\n\r\nOne of the bonuses of the room was the very fashionable interior decor;  walnut furnishings of very high quality....very nice apron styled sink with oiled bronze faucet.....stunning bathroom tiling work (in very new condition I might add)....These were just a few of the really nice touches.\r\n\r\nLocation:  Amazing location...close to Powell Street and the cable cars.....right next to Union Square and the shopping district!  Tons of great restaurants!   This hotel is located right next to a 5 star hotel....so the location really can't be beat!

It said 4 stars and I generally agree with that rating.  The hotel was very nice and the remodeling they're doing makes it look very modern.  It was a great location, close to the BART stop from San Francisco Airport (3 blocks) and close to everything I wanted to see while in downtown.  The hotel bar had great drink selections and awesome bartenders (I didn't try the food there).  They held our bags all day Friday before our 4 PM check-in and then again all day Sunday before we flew out (so that we could sight see with just a backpack).  The gym was awesome with multiple cardio machines and a nice set of dumbbells (5-50 lbs.).\r\n\r\nI did have a couple small complaints about the hotel though.  Our room was on the 3rd floor and they seem to still be remodeling the portion of the floor where our room was.  For example, the wood floors outside our door in the hallway as well as the floors inside our room creaked loudly when we walked on them.  This was an issue for me because I wake up earlier than my wife and go to the gym, and I try to sneak out of the room.  The creaking floors made that impossible.  Also, the shower took about ten minutes for the water to get up to warm/hot temperatures after turning it on.  This was slightly annoying.  Like I said, I agree with the 4 star rating, but they need to fix a couple of things to stay in that 4 star area.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2015-07-20T19:48:43Z","roomTypeId":200648000,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"24540","reviewId":"55abc4f32902ca08f9eb1959","photos":[],"itinId":"1104919982678","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"HMP MMD","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Eddie","brandType":"Expedia","title":"","reviewText":"More precisely, I would give this hotel 3.5 stars.  \r\n\r\nWe stayed at Hotel G for 4 nights and had a relatively good experience.

The hotel appears relatively new so retains a clean appearance.

Things like this make it seem like it was rushed and not of a great quality. \r\nWe booked the entry level room which was small but in that respect I think it reflects what we payed. The bed was comfortable, nice linens and pillows but was pretty small for a double which made for a poorer nights sleep. I think again reflective of the entry level room we had no view other than an external metal staircase from the window. \r\nLighting isn't great in the rooms, again I think this is due to the rooms styling, but it can be a bit frustrating when getting ready. \r\nThe bathroom was nicely styled but the shower was weak, you didn't quite have to run around to get wet but it not far off that.

We got a combo deal with flight through Expedia.  We came to San Francisco for our anniversary.  The hotel seems pretty old, but has been refurbished on the inside.  The elevators are small and quaint, but are efficient.  We never had to wait too long for one.  When we arrived, the concierge was friendly and immediately upgraded us to a King bed from a Queen.  The room was comfortable with plenty of space.  The bathroom was small, but adequate.  Everything was clean.  I swear that we could hear every word of the people in the next room as if they were in our room!  There is no sound dampening at all.  Also, during the night, we could hear much of the noise outside in the streets below.  You kind of get used to it and, I guess, that is the price you pay for staying in an older hotel without any sound dampening in the middle of downtown San Francisco.  On the other hand, Hotel G was within walking distance of everything we wanted to see in town so, overall, we were pleased with the facilities.  One final note... my wife told me she really liked Hotel G and would stay there again.

However, the room was much better than the elevator. The decor is unusual. The pluses are the bed, which was phenomenally comfortable, and of course the price. The minuses are relatively minor, but include the shower (which was barely 4 inches across and lacked water pressure) and the lack of plugs for charging my various devices, and the fact that sometimes the cutesiness outweighed practicality (it took me 10 minutes to realize that he hair dryer was in the bag marked \"BLOW\").

This hotel has very thin walls because you can hear lots of noise and creaking and you can actually feel the wall shake when the elevator operates. In my opinion the rooms next to the elevator should not even be guest rooms with all the noise that occurs. You can also hear people walking through the hallways very clearly, it feels like there is no soundproofing at all\r\n- The air conditioning is incredibly loud, you would want to turn it off while sleeping\r\n- The room is tiny. There is hardly enough space for two people. The bathroom does not have any space near the sink to place your toiletries\r\n- No cell reception in the rooms (T-mobile)\r\n\r\nThe only thing really going for this hotel is the location.

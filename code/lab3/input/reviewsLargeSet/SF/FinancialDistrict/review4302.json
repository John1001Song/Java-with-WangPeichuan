You can't sleep in the room. Any room in the hotel with the room number of 00 (eg mine 1100) is right next to the bank of four lifts, which, of course, almost never stop operating, The result is that it is like trying to sleep next to a random, but frequent subway. This is the worse kind of noise to deal with, as any OHS or neurologist will tell you, because one can't adjust to it. Even with earplugs, the noise was unrelenting. I will always check in the future to make sure that my room is not located next to the lifts. I think that it is ethically incumbent on hotels, especially high end hotels like Hilton, and travel companies, such as Expedia, to alert their customers about the disadvantages of staying in particular rooms with particular problems, after all these disadvantages are the reason the rooms are being offered at cheaper rates..","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":1,"positiveRemarks":"The room was standard, the location convenient.","negativeRemarks":"The bank of lift wells and the rooms immediately next to the lift wells could be MUCH better acoustically protected to reduce the noise from the lifts","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Sydney","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-09-23T12:16:06Z","roomTypeId":200128454,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":true,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"hotelId":"4302","reviewId":"57dbde71463e9d0b26255722","photos":[],"itinId":"1144704721372","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[{"isFlaggable":true,"userNickname":"Megan","displayLocale":"en_us","date":"2016-09-19T18:29:51Z","id":"85ae3cfd-f68c-4039-9d4a-910e8cc982d2","response":"Thank you for your feedback.

Our flight landed around 12 pm. We took the BART which arrived at the Financial district around 1pm, hence why we were so early. The front desk staff member said we were a bit early, but still had a room available with the requested \"Bayview.\" Unfortunately, we faced a huge building in front of us. Just a tad bit the the right of our view was the bay. I regretted paying extra for the, \"view,\" since it wasn't what I was expecting. \r\n\r\nThe room itself was fine. Nothing seemed outdated. It was clean as well. The odd thing was that there was only 1 night stand. Maybe the room was designed for a single person. I'm not sure. So it was a bit annoying sleeping without a night stand for me, since my wife slept on the side with the stand. I couldn't place a glass or bottle of water at night, but I made due with the ottoman. The walls were too thin. We heard our neighbors every morning. They were our alarm clock. \r\n\r\nWe did have another hiccup with our TV remote. The batteries were low. We called front desk to have someone look at it, so they can replace the batteries. Several hours went by, nobody came. We did get a call from front desk asking if our issue was handled. We said no, nobody ever came. The person said they will send someone right away, but we were ready to explore the city, so we said that it's fine. To send someone later or hopefully when house keeping comes, it will be handled. Which it was!

We were told that we could arrive for check-in at 12pm and after walking to the hotel to check in from the CalTrain station, one of the staff told us that the room was not ready and asked us to come back around 3pm. We arrived back at the hotel 5 minutes to 3pm and the staff member was frantic and taking a while to check us in. I had to ask her what was wrong and she stated that the guest did not check out. After patiently waiting 10 minutes, I asked her why a room was not prepared prior to knowing that they were not going to check out as my group had dinner reservations in an hour and we had to get ready. Another staff member came over to help her and he gave me attitude as I explained to him that we arrived at 12pm and that it was ridiculous that we still have to wait and are not being communicated with on what is going on. We got our room keys at 3:25 and arrived at our room at 3:30. We were late to our dinner reservations. I explained my frustration the next day to the morning manager and he stated that his records show that we checked in at 3:05pm. The manager did not feel they needed to take any responsibility as he felt the staff did the best they could to accommodate me. This hotel provided the worst bachelorette experience for me as I was not able to relax as I wanted to and did not receive the upmost in customer service after paying $250 per night to stay here.

The person I talked to was obnoxious told him the entire situation and didn't even offer an apology. He told me, I didn't assign the room to somebody else. That wasn't me (with an attitude).

We were told when we checked in that we were not to leave the dog in the room unattended, and then had to sign a pet agreement. I asked for a copy of what I was signing so that I could read it. I read the agreement when I got to the room and it actually said something like, \"If you are to leave the room the dog must be contained in a kennel with a sign on the door that says pet friendly room\" This goes against what the woman told me at check in. They did not provide us with any of the pet supplies stated, such as this sign that goes on the door, a pet bed and bowl. We had a bed and bowl anyways but its just that it said it was supplied and it was not. Our room was very nice, loved the balcony. Bed comfortable, bell staff was very friendly.\nWe had to pay an OUTRAGEOUS fee of $60 for parking. Fine. But, upon leaving I gave our ticket to the valet to retrieve our car and when they drove it out, they parked it, left it running with the door open. They did not bring me the keys, they didn't tell me my car was ready, they didn't help me put my bags in the car...and they never even verified the car belonged to us...they just left it there in the hotel lot running and walked away. We were in a hurry to get to a wedding so I didn't have time to say anything to anyone about it...but I thought that was pretty shocking.

The problem is that such conditions were never disclosed during the reservation procedure. The price was smaller, but the only difference stated was that instead of two beds the room had 1. In addition, the room was also located right by the elevator shaft, so you could hear it operating all night long!\nThere were also no disclaimers about their parking belonging to a \"third party\" (ACE), so when they hit me with a $120 bill for two days of parking (!), I asked for \"a break\" but was told there was nothing they could do, and that I'd have to take the matters to the ACE management.\nI'm never staying there again. I suggest that you look for other hotels. You will find similar prices for much bigger rooms.

The Hilton Downtown/ Financial District was a great location. Multiple reasons why this was a great location. (1) Right on the edge of China town, 1 block away. (2) 3 - 4 blocks from the nearest cable car hop-on spot, which gets you to Union Square or Fishermans Wharf in minutes. (3) 15 - 20 minute walk to Union Square, which is where the start of the cable car line is, lots of shopping, and restaurants. (4) 25 minute walk to Fishermans Wharf. (5) 10 - 15 minute walk to Coit Tower. (6) 25 minute walk to Lombard Street. We planned to take cable cars everywhere, which is the easy way and close to the hotel. We ended up buying a 3-day pass (at Union Square Cable Car ticket booth) which gives you access to multiple modes of public transportation. The cable cars are a lot of fun but we ended up walking most everywhere. Great city for it. The hotel itself had a great location, very friendly staff, and modern feel.

The financial district and Embarcadero are right down the street. HOWEVER, the strip joints and bars of North Beach are also about 1/2 mile up the street, and they are crazy noisy with people screaming, hooting and yelling from about 9 pm until they close at 2 a.m. At about 2:30, it becomes super quiet and you can finally get some sleep. We were there on a weekend, so I don't know if it's this bad during the week, but on Friday and Saturday night, it's very noisy.\n\nNo matter where you stay, go to the Farmers Market at the Embarcadero Ferry Landing on Saturday morning. It is amazing!

We figured at least we could sleep in the following morning. But their clock alarm went off at 7, and they kept hitting the snooze button every ten minutes for an hour. I have never before in a hotel heard a standard alarm in another room through the walls. The hotel must know of the problem, given the pair of earplugs that were lying on a bedstand. I complained the next morning to the one clerk on duty, and it was evident that she had heard similar complaints before. She said it must have been that the adjoining room had a common door (though it did not); that's an excuse you might accept from a $39/night hotel, not a Hilton. We had booked through Expedia, and even their intervention produced nothing -- they said Hilton even claimed that there was no record of anyone complaining that morning.

What thought to be a quality stay, turned out to be a mere dissappointment for me and my husband on New Year's Eve of 2009. Hotel's staff seemed to be overwhelmed with festive customers; therefore, they were definetely tired of accomodating me and my husband with a proper service. Our room was tiny and stinky; of coarse, we demanded another, but the general manager seemed also very annoyed and he was not willing to chahnge anything untill my husband explained him some basic notions about appropriate customer service. We have finally got a nice room. It all happened on New Year's Eve. People in the hotel were well drunk by 8pm, which was rather understandable for the holiday. We left for our party. On the return back to hotel on January 1, 2009 at 4am, we were greeted by several huge security guys, who had very little idea of an accepted human behavior outside of their home. Finally, I got so tired of all this commercilal corporate attitude, that I asked my husband to leave the place immedialtely. So we did.

I have stayed at many Hilton hotels around the country, and am a member of the Hilton Honors program. This hotel has many of the conveniences and standards of other Hilton hotels around the country - the rooms are good sized, clean, and the beds are comfortable. What I was shocked to find at this particular hotel was the extremely poor service. The snobbery was almost comical, till you realize that you are paying a premium price for substandard service. Ask for advice on a good restaurant to dine in - no help. Ask about what activities are good for visitors - \"Go to Chinatown\" (pretty nonspecific). The final straw was when I was trying to check out and wanted to clarify something on my bill. I and two other travelers waited in line for 45 minutes for two receptionists to stop talking to each other, and when I mentioned to the concierge that it was disrespectful for us to wait so long, he promptly told me that all personnel were busy. This would have sounded better had I not looked into the back office and seen three others happily chatting away. The time - 9 am on a Monday. When it was finally my turn, I even mentioned to the receptionist that \"I'm sure that the corporate office wouldn't approve\". The response - \"Sorry, hope you have better luck next time\".

The problem was finding a human to talk to. Once I did, they kept trying to explain the room had \"wireless\" internet. Finally, the concierge understood what I was requiring, but, alas, was no help. The room, though, was clean and comfortable. The restaurant (Seventy-Five or Seven-Fifty??) left a lot to be desired. I would stay there again, because, compared to the surrounding financial district hotels, it was a good value. Just be sure to bring your own power cord.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Los Angeles, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-06-18T16:41:53Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"4302","reviewId":"17616454","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Ewin","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Excellent Hotel, Fantastic Views!","reviewText":"Overall, this is simply a superlative hotel located in a dynamic, centralized area convenient to Union Square, Chinatown, North Beach dining, and not far from Fisherman's Wharf.

From SFO you can catch the BART to the Montgumery St station, and you are only about a 8 or 9 block walk through the financial district to the hotel. The hotel sits right at the north end of the Financial district, so getting to any place down there is a couple of minute walk away. For leisure activities, you are 2 blocks from Columbus ave, which has many great restraunts and eventually hits Fisherman's Wharf. You are also only 4 blocks from California street where it is easy to catch the famous Cable Cars. From there you can ride up Nob Hill, and catch another Cable Car route to put you into Union Square, or take you all the way to Fisherman's Wharf. (Also runs right across Lombard street, which is really a site to see!) From the Cable Cars you can catch a great view of Alcatraz also. Once on the north side, you are very close to the Golden Gate Bridge. The hotel itself is right next (read: across the street) from China Town. The Italian district is also just a short walk. (4 blocks or so) I loved the hotel bar, the people are very nice, and the food is great. Also a recommended stop would be the San Francisco Brewery (Corner of Columbus and Kearny, only a 2 block walk), they have some great ales and lagers on tap! I would recommend this place for anyone that needs to do some business but would also like to get out and have fun.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Omaha, NE","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-11-07T21:30:37Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"4302","reviewId":"17616282","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Kim","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Some basics missing","reviewText":"While this hotel looked nice and the service was more than satisfactory, Hilton seems to have overlooked a few basics.

If too expensive to replace the windows during a $45 million renovation, why not at least provide alarm clocks with a white noise option? No such luck for us. The shower in the remodeled bathroom also left something to be desired. It was only about 5'6'' tall, meaning we had to duck under to wash our face or hair. Not the most relaxing experience.

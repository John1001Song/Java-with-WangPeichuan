Upon arriving, I was skeptical because of the reviews, but it was a perfectly quaint room; it was all I and my significant other needed for a 3 day getaway. I read reviews about burglary by the staff, so we kept the Do Not Disturb sign on for the duration of our trip; no problems there. The only hassle we encountered was parking. It's $41 to valet by the hotel, $25 to park right next to it at the Auto Repair shop, if parking is available, $26 to park at AMC around the block, and $1-4 to park on the street, if parking is available AND on specified days. We did end up getting a parking ticket, the times are somewhat misleading. But other than the parking issue, it truly was a great experience.

Most of the time we spent awake in the room the first couple days I was researching other hotels so I could escape the place. In the end we were there for a week. \r\nThere was a stink in the room that was intolerable when we arrived. It wasn't hard to find mold in the bathroom or around the windows. Everything was dated and run down in the room and around the hotel. The toilet ran constantly. There was a bare bulb to light the room because the ceiling fan wobbled so much that no shade would survive long. The shower didn't drain. Sometimes the hot water came out as cold as the cold water. The neighbourhood is right at the center of homelessness and there's nothing but boarded up buildings across the street. The whole place is dingy and mildly disgusting. \r\nBut we fixed the drain ourselves and learned that the smell vanished if the bathroom door was closed. And the alternative places sounded equally dodgy or were a huge jump in price. We adapted. It was fine. \r\nThe lobby staff seemed a little gun shy. From what we saw they are quite used to people taking one look and wanting their money back. Once they know you're not a drunken mess and that you're not going to yell at them, they're ok. \r\nBeds are comfortable enough. There is pretty frequent noise from fire trucks and random yelling on the street. \r\nWe got used to it though. Central. Comical.

After flagging down my boyfriend, he squeezes into the entrance of the lot. The repair shop owner had to move 4 cars so that we could have a \"spot\" which was then blocked back in.

Traffic from the street was loud and the 1980's TV didnt help to drown it out. Checkout was very smooth however, with a pleasant lady. We went to get our car and the shop owner had to move a bunch of cars to try and get us out. Just not a good experience.

The location of the hotel is good, it is easy to jump on the bus and the BART station was around a ten minute walk from the hotel. The first three days I was there the staff were incredibly helpful and told me how to get around on public transport to see the sights. However the last two days there was a lady at the desk that spoke little English and gave me wrong directions...! Hm. Also I noticed that the windows were incredibly dirty and there was a lot of dust on the blinds. However the staff hoovered my room, made my bed and provided fresh towels on a daily basis. I could hear the occupants in the next room when they were using the bathroom (eew!) but was able to resolve this problem by keeping my bathroom door shut. The area is a little rough and ready at night time but perhaps I felt that way because I was travelling solo. It is a basic hotel so if you are looking for somewhere cheap to stay as a springboard for your trip to San Fran then this is the place to stay. It is incredibly basic but I guess that is reflected in the price. There is a nice diner at the top of the road called Mel's cafe and they do an amazing breakfast!

Our room was located along the back of the hotel, facing the alley between the hotel and a parking garage. Somewhere in the area, trucks were either being loaded or unloading during the early morning hours, loud enough to think that our windows were left open. The patrons of the local bars were quite noisy around 2 or 3 AM, and sirens could be heard at any time of night.\n\nThe parking garage is the best place to park, as far as I can tell. $20 a day, but plenty of parking available at night. A parking valet is available for $24 a day, but that service is generally not available after 11 PM.\n\nOverall, the hotel is rather old, and could use a little updating. Our room was somewhat spartan, with no refrigerator, no hotel information guide, and no ice machine on the same floor. The flooring within the entire hotel is rather creaky, and our room had a bit of a dip in one spot of the floor underneath the carpet.\n\nOn the upside, a Mel's Drive-In restaurant is located on the same block, and the staff did a nice job of keeping the room clean. None of the staff I came across were ill-tempered. The hotel is located one block off of Van Ness, pretty much in the middle of town, so you can reach most places in San Francisco by car pretty quickly, but it's a hike of 8-10 blocks to the nearest stop for the cable car.\n\nOverall, I would look into other options the next time.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-07-31T16:11:16Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"444672","reviewId":"18286924","photos":[],"itinId":"377970851","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":2,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Anonymous","brandType":"Expedia","title":"It's in the Tenderloin district!","reviewText":"Old building, but some effort has been put into remodelling.

My own opinion only, but no matter how good the deal is, this hotel should not be offered on any travel site. It is just too old and should not used as a hotel.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":1,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Ontario, Canada","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-12-29T14:53:29Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"444672","reviewId":"18286862","photos":[],"itinId":"343778166","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":2,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Arash","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Probably ok for the price but not good","reviewText":"No internet!

This location is walking distance to Union Square and on the bus line. There are many good hole in the wall restaurants in the area and a nice coffee shop across the street. As for the hotel itself, it was built in the 20's. The room was small, but clean. I have only two complaints. First, the water pressure is extremely low to the point that it was difficult to shower. Second, the free Internet sucks and is essentially useless. Management...change the password occasionally so that the people in the apartments next door can't bog down the system so much. Certainly not the best hotel I have stayed in, but not the worst either. I think that the price was fair with all considered. San Francisco is such a great food city.

It's true it is a Hospital very close and you can hear the ambulances from time to time but, at least while we were there, it was not too bad (on the weekend). An important issue is that the surrounding areas are not really nice at night. There are a lot of homeless lying in the street, specially after 6 o 7 pm. Probably they are nice people but it's not a nice environment to take a walk with your family. At least Geary is an avenue so it is well iluminated. They do not serve breakfast but if you want to buy something (there are a lot of places within 1 or 2 blocks) and bring it to the hotel you have a place to have breakfast in the lobby. They provide FREE hot coffee and tea all day long (and it was always hot). Consider that my level of satisfaction with the hotel takes into account, specially, the price. Course, there were some minimum details (e.g. it does not include local calls and the wireless service was not good).

The hotel once you walked inside isn't so bad, but the rooms are really small. We had a king size bed, a small bathroom, & a little t.v. My boyfriend is 6'5 so it was a bit uncomfortable for him. Their is no A/C in the rooms at this hotel, just a heater, and our's had a broken knob. It was pretty warm, but all we could do is open the windows. The room & bathroom were clean, but the carpet is old. I was able to sleep at one point, but ALL night you could hear people shouting in the streets, police car sirens, alarms going off, etc. I felt like I was in the hood. The area is basically like a hood, and we walked during the day to Union Station which was near by (about 7 blocks), and also to dinner at The Cheesecake Factory which is inside Macy's and we walked back at night (around 9:30pm), and I must say, I was a little scared, but I felt safe with my boyfriend. Also, if you stay here & walk around at night, be prepared for people to talk to you on the street asking for money, change, or trying to con you. We encountered that about 5 times in just 7 blocks walking back to our room. There is adult book stores across the street, & some nude places near by, so it's definitely not a hotel for a family to stay at.

It gets you unlimited 7 day bus/cable car fare, plus it gets you into some really good museums to see. If you like ethnic food the hotel is near several different types of restaurants. However, it is limited to the number of chains within a 4 block radius (with the exception of Mel's Diner). Overall the experience was positive. The hotel staff provided extra blankets when requested and provide useful information when requested. Parents should be forewarned that there is a porn shop across the street and a few strip clubs nearby.

Also, while charming, the elevator is the old metal kind so you can hear the door creak closed and that can be annoying. I would recommend this hotel for the location, value and ease of getting to.

So I wanted to crash for a little while before the conference that evening. Unfortunately there was a jack hammer right outside the hotel digging up the sidewalk. So I asked if I can switch rooms but it wasn't possible. So I just went sight-seeing. However there is building construction going on right across the street. So do not plan on sleeping in past 7am if you're there Monday through Sat. The room was clean, I was able to use my wireless connection in the hotel fairly well and I was above the 5th floor but there is no ethernet port if you plan on plugging in you must have wireless. This hotel serves its purpose if you want to go sightseeing in the bay area and stay in a cheap hotel and don't stay up late because you're Not sleeping in. It is a very old building with a kind of an old fashioned closet elevator that makes lots of creeking noises. I met a girl at the conference that was going to hang out with me that night and when she went to drop me off she said I was in a bad neighborhood and there was absolutely nowhere to park. So that was the end of my date. That's the other thing the public transportation is excellent but this part of town and this hotel is not car-friendly.

I arrived at the hotel at 11pm aprox, to find out that all the parking was taken. The clerk told me that I was on my own and would have to park in the structure 3 to 4 blocks away (and $20 overnight parking). I was tired so I went where I was told, the walk back to the hotel was scary as there were drunks and homeless people all over the streets. The clerk at the front desk was rude and demanded my credit card in order to check me in. I gave it to him but I told him that I had paid everything through Expedia, he demanded my credit card and charged $12.50. At this point all I wanted to do was get to my bed, and get to a phone to call en Expedia operator. To my surprise, the noise inside the hotel was horrible! My room faced Geary Ave, a very bussy street but to top things off, there was an adult video store directly across from my room.

The rooms are tiny and with minimal utilities, but it's an older building so the ceiling is higher than average.

Once the car was parked I then had to walk outside to the street, around the block, past a seedy looking alley, before being able to enter the hotel. Hotels should offer free vouchers for parking if they intend to make it such an ordeal for their patrons. Overall I gave my experience at the Monarch Hotel a 2 out of 5 rating.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Salt Lake City, UT","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-06-01T14:56:55Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"444672","reviewId":"18286857","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Erin","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Nice for the Price","reviewText":"With a good deal on Expedia, this hotel located just several blocks from Union Square is a bargain.

The lobby area is the breakfast area, with standing room for only two people.  There are no trays to take your food/coffee to room, so take the one from your room.  Breakfast very basic: bread, frozen waffles, bananas, cereal, coffee, juice.  You have to pay for bottle water/pop.  Staff are slow to open and put food out and quick to put away so go early if you want breakfast.  Parking is limited and frustrating because guests cannot seem to park within the lines.  One of us had to guide the other into the stall every time. You also have back out of the parking lot, which is courtyard style, onto Lombard Street. The wifi, though the hotel has 3 guest wifi lines it was always a challenge to logon and remain on for any length of time before you lost the connection - very frustrating when you are using the wifi for map directions in the city.  Lastly the hotel and room: On the third level there is a deck which we found by accident which would have been beautiful had the entire upper corridor not been covered with plastic sheeting and plywood laying on top of it to prevent the plastic from blowing off not to mention the dead plants, old light fixtures and 2x4 lumbers everywhere.

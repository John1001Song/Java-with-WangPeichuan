The staff were welcoming and congratulated us on our honeymoon (I made mention of this in the check-in comments) which was nice.  The room was a standard size for the era of the hotel, being built in 1914, but spacious enough for our liking.  The bed was fantastic, and they offered pillow service as well - a nice touch to see.  When we returned to our room that night, they set out some champagne and rubber duckies of a bride and groom... this is definitely a signature of the hotel, I loved the extra touches.  Overall the hotel was in good shape, I noticed some carpets being replaced during the day so there is some work still being completed.  The elevators are also fairly small and somewhat slow, but for a 100 year old hotel that's how things were built - they worked and that's all that matters.  \r\n\r\nI was very pleased overall with our experience, we got a great story to share in a hotel right on Union Square far cheaper than the big hotels beside us.  I would recommend it to anyone willing to step outside the box (just a touch).","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"Remodeled rooms, comfortable bed, fantastic location, relatively affordable compared to other hotels in the area, nice character","negativeRemarks":"Minor issues with billing but not major.","locationRemarks":"Union Square shopping, trolley car stop directly outside the hotel, perfect central area to explore San Francisco from","lastInitial":"P","userLocation":"Calgary","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-09-23T16:48:51Z","roomTypeId":10006,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":true,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"20547","reviewId":"57e1feb84e0ff60b5accfca8","photos":[],"itinId":"1127881703069","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great location!!","reviewText":"Great staff, very accommodating and helpful.

Our flight arrived at 10 a.m. And they were able to provide us a room right away so we didn't have to wait until the 3 pm check in time. Overall our stay was fine apart from a couple of minor snafus. The most irritating one being that we ordered pizza to stay in one evening and went down to the bar to get drinks to take up. The bartender took our order, gave me my bud light but didn't get my husband his cocktail for 10 minutes. Instead she thought it was more important to take a few dirty cups to the kitchen. We clearly were just wanting to get drinks and go back up but she was rude and told us to sit down and served several others ahead of us. The situation could have been handled much more professional and productive on her end. Not a huge deal but annoying none the less. \r\nThis hotel is located a half block from major shopping like saks fifth avenue, coach, and more high end stores.

The bathroom smelled gross. Almost like a men's restroom/ urinal. It smelled of urine and didn't seem clean at all. We didn't even want to use the bathroom. The bed was hard and still. At least the pillows were comfortable. PARKING is about 40 bucks  if you parked it yourself which is a block away. You would have to walk all the way back with your bags.

Being that the building is old, the lobby and rooms have a great deal of charm and character. This is not a boxy cookie cutters style hotel.

The room was so immaculately clean and well-appointed that it was easy to overlook its rather small size, and the views are amazing from both the front and the back of the hotel. I love the quaintness of the vintage fixtures, and the rubber ducky is a lovely whimsical touch in an otherwise quietly genteel boutique hotel.

There where 2 guys in the morning who made it up!!, no one to help you with the bags or either to hold the front door for you!!....the only mole in my beautiful 7 days stay.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Costa Rica","reviewSubmissionTime":"2013-10-23T21:15:47Z","roomTypeId":10006,"userDisplayName":"Adri","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"20547","reviewId":"60183500","photos":[],"itinId":"159844016486","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Nice hotel in center city","reviewText":"Noisy room above street level for first night, idling truck form 3 - 5 am, had to change room","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2013-10-23T18:14:50Z","roomTypeId":10006,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"21187","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"20547","reviewId":"60131622","photos":[],"itinId":"161687105611","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"","reviewText":"","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":true,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2013-10-22T21:42:04Z","roomTypeId":10006,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"25","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_au","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"20547","reviewId":"60102813","photos":[],"itinId":"11176292555","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"3081","userNickname":"Adam","brandType":"Expedia","title":"A clasic hotel worth your visit","reviewText":"This is a charming hotel build in 1914 which still retains its chracter and charm.

At least the man behind the front desk who I told later was apologetic and agreed that shouldn't have happened.\n\nOther drawbacks: the guests next door were rather noisy and the walls were thin. Also, the mini refrigerator was very loud and I had to unplug it at night, thereby rendering it useless as a refrigerator, so not much point in having it.\n\nI also wish there had been a coffeemaker in the room, although there was coffee in the lobby (which I didn't discover until my 4th day there) and plenty of coffee shops nearby.\n\nThe safe was too small for my laptop although at least nothing happened to it.\n\nOverall, though, I had a good experience here and would recommend it.

The street noise in general did not bother us but the ambulance sirens did as they sounded like wailing or a child crying.

Rooms are not air conditioned but do have a ceiling fan. My only suggestion to the hotel - rather than having the heavy comforters on the bed during the warmer months, perhaps a light throw would be a better alternative? You could not have slept with it on the bed so it had to be dragged off and put somewhere every night.

Almost all that I hoped for, and much, much better than I feared, in an otherwise quite tourist-trappy San Francisco!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Krakow, Poland","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-06-27T18:34:33Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"BusinessTravelers","categoryLabel":"BusinessTravelers"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"20547","reviewId":"18441100","photos":[],"itinId":"365169397","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Daisy","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Loved it!","reviewText":"Loved the room.

I always ask for a room off the street because the street cars and crowds on Powell Street can get noisy.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Clearwater FL","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-02-16T17:12:41Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"20547","reviewId":"18441350","photos":[],"itinId":"352460843","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Amanda","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Excellent choice","reviewText":"This hotel is in a perfect location.

First impressions were mixed but that sooned changed with the friendly welcome we were given. We were given a room immediately on the 13th floor which suprised us as we thought check in would not be till at least 2.00pm. Our room was quaint, a king size bed with furniture and decor that matched the charm of this fantastic city.\nIf anyone is looking for a hotel in San Fransico which is right in Union Square and surrounded by some of the best shopping in the world from Macys, Bloomingdales down to the best outlets where one can get bargains you would not believe.\nPut quite simply, if anyone is looking to stay in this city for a few days to see the sights, do some shopping, eat at some great restaurants, including the one at the Chancellor, don't look any further than The Chancellor, you will not be disapponted.\nOur visit will be always remembered here as one of the best times we have had on our trips overseas and just like the famous song, you can and will leave a piece of your heart in San Fransico.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Melbourne< australia","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-10-26T04:20:26Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"20547","reviewId":"18441199","photos":[],"itinId":"336904394","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Charles","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Perfect for San Francisco","reviewText":"Rates were good, room was comfortable, we enjoyed the whole trip","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Ecru, MS","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-10-21T01:50:28Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"4","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_ca","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"20547","reviewId":"18441110","photos":[],"itinId":"337088217","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"4105","userNickname":"Madaleine","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great place to stay!","reviewText":"The location is great, very central and a good starting point to explore the city.

Everything was great. The price was very reasonable. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was clean, neat and quiet. We knew going in, that there would be no air conditioning. That turned out to be a moot point, as the temperature during the day never climbed above the low 60s. And heat was provided by a portable space heater that was stored in the closet. At night the temperature only went down to the low 50s, so my wife wheeled out the heater and it was adequate in keeping the room warm. We were there in late July. We also knew we were only getting twin-size beds--now we understand why. The rooms are just not big enough to support anything larger. They turned out to be okay for our stay. We never ordered room service, but did eat lunch in the restaurant once and breakfast several times. The food was good and reasonably priced (by hotel standards). For convenience, they had wifi in the rooms (requiring a username and password). I have a wifi-enabled smartphone. And after it didn't work the first day, I tried again the second day and was able to get on the Internet on my phone. They also had a PC down in the lobby, available for use. All-in-all, it was a very pleasant stay there, although we were gone most of each day, touring San Francisco.

True to the style, the room and bathroom were on the small side, but not at all run-down. If you like sleek, modern hotels, then this is NOT the place for you. The bed was very comfortable. The option of selecting your pillow type was a neat idea. Like every other hotel in SF that I have ever stayed at, there is no AC. In that to get cool air, one has to keep their window open, subjecting the guest to street noise (why must the SF sanitation dept work in the middle of the night?!). There was only one night at The Chancellor that this was a problem. My one gripe was the service at the restaurant where we went one morning for breakfast. The guy who waited on us was the same who seated us. How could he forget we were there? There was only one other party eating there when we were seated. After 20 minutes, and seeing other people seated and waited on who came AFTER us, I finally sought him out. No apologies.

The closet was huge! In my opinion they should have cut back on the closet space and expanded the bathroom so it can fit more than 1 person at a time. Another downside is that the room we were in had an adjoining door, and although the walls were pretty thick the doors weren't - we could clearly hear our neighbors' conversation in their room. The hotel offers a \"pillow bar\" where you can select what type of pillow suits you best for your sleeping needs, and they will exchange the pillows in your room for the one you select. I stuck with the ones that came in the room, and they suited me just fine. The bed was firm and the sheets were soft and warm. There's definitely some city noise if you're on the street side, but I'm sure that would be the same at any other hotel.

Rooms were very comfortable but small, as this is an old hotel given a recent facelift. All plumbing worked perfectly. The choice of pillows is a nice touch. Not much of a bar, but who cares? There are hundreds of other choices within walking distance. My only caveat: the walls are very thin (though I've heard this about a lot of the older San Fran. hotels), so if there's a party going on next door, you'll hear it.

Probably the best place I've stayed for the money.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"TIlburg, Netherlands","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-07-22T13:31:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"20547","reviewId":"18440973","photos":[],"itinId":"283759549","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Yiying","brandType":"Expedia","title":"convinent and reasonable price!! good choice!!","reviewText":"Good!!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-07-22T13:08:47Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"20547","reviewId":"18441348","photos":[],"itinId":"282415998","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Lawrence","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great Place","reviewText":"Very clean pleasant hotel located right by Union Square.

We were also within walking distance of Chinatown, the Financial District and the Civic Center/Asian Art Museum. A short ride on the bus (at a very affordable senior's discount price) took us to Japantown, with its ethnic restaurants and shops.

If you've been in a major city before, then you won't think this neighborhood is bad. In fact, there's a Saks Fifth Avenue across the street - last time I checked, they don't put those in bad neighborhoods.

I had initially planned to stay closer to the Moscone Center, but the convenience of Union Square to restaurants and shopping drew me to the Chancellor, as did the very affordable rates. Based on other reviews I requested a high floor room at the rear of the building. I was given a room at the back the 13th floor, which made for some interesting banter with the bellman in the elevator. The room was smallish, with a double bed, but perfectly adequate for one and there was plenty of closet space. The bath was compact, clearly old, but decently updated; had my wife been along I'm sure we'd have wished it was bigger, but it was fine for one. Lack of AC was not a problem, but I can imagine that it could be. I'd request a north or east facing room in the summer. Breakfast was very tasty, a decent value, and service was prompt and attentive, so I was able to get in and out quickly, which I really appreciated. Overall, I was very impressed with the level of service received and the Chancellor's staff was very friendly. The only thing I didn't really like was the lobby bar - it certainly wasn't anywhere I'd want to have a drink, just not a very attractive or welcoming space. Perhaps without TV it would have had more appeal. I'd recommend the Chancellor to travelers looking for a hotel with a convenient location and great service who can do without marble bathrooms and empty square footage.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Red Lodge, Montana","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-05-14T04:47:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"20547","reviewId":"18441089","photos":[],"itinId":"272028778","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Patricia","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Centrally located with cable car access out the front door.","reviewText":"We chose this hotel based on reviews from others who have stayed at the Chancellor, and we were not disappointed.

My wife and I were very pleased with the service from the point of check in. The room was clean, stocked with above average amenities, including some neat features like the DIY Spa package for the tub and a pillow menu. Even the ice bucket was classy. The bed was comfortable, the noise was low, except on the weekends and in the mornings. Waking up to the clanging of the cable car was more of fun, unique experience vs. an annoyance. There is no air conditioning. If it is over 80F outside, it might get a bit stuffy. The room was also a decent size for two adults, not too big or too small and it offered a great walk in closet. Every time we walked around the lobby looking confused, someone was there to help, whether it was to hail a cab, learn how to ride the cable cars and buy a cable car pass, check in/out, park, or grab a late evening glass of wine at the bar. Throughout the day, you can take advantage of their coffee and cookie service in the lobby. A key feature of this hotel is the location. You are on top of Union Square. It is a 10 minute walk to Chinatown (you can avoid the hill by walking down Post to Stockton). All in all, my wife and I were very pleased with the value the Chancellor offers. The management seems to pay close attention to details that tend to be overlooked in hotels that are more expensive.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Brooklyn, NY","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-04-17T14:28:51Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"20547","reviewId":"18440875","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Eric","brandType":"Expedia","title":"You can't get more central","reviewText":"I was surprised at what we got for the price, pleasantly surprised.

But the ambiance, and more importantly the friendly, attentive, courteous staff make up for any of it's few shortcomings. The following warning does not reflect in any way The Chancellor Hotel: San Francisco is a wonderful place full of adventure and history but there is a professional criminal element alive and well. My wife was pick pocketed during our stay on one of the cable car stops. It was a professional set up involving multiple people and was executed with perfection. The San Francisco police will not respond to a non-violent crime, so they are free to operate unabated. We had to fill out a police report ONLINE!

We knew that we wanted a hotel that felt like San Francisco, not the local chain at the freeway interchange, and after much Internet searching chose the Chancellor. We could not have been more pleased. The hotel is located near Union Square and The City is all around you. We could see the Square from our rooms, hear the cable cars, eat breakfast and lunch in a lovely small restaurant in the hotel with other eating opportunities with multiple alternatives within two blocks, walk as much of The City as we wished, catch public transportation within a few blocks to take us to all sites of interest, easily catch a cab, be served by a cooperative friendly staff, know that we were entirely safe, and all at a very reasonable cost. Sure, the hotel is old and could use some up dating, especially the bathrooms, but even here a word of caution is necessary. To up date too much would reduce the charm, and the charm is more important than the fanciest shower.

Our twin room was good sized we didnt intend to spend time there except for sleeping, and we could not complain about the bathroom - though not large enough to walk around in, the shower and bath were very good size and standard. We requested a room away from street noise and got a quiet room at the back (not a great view, but what would you expect!). We really appreciated the free internet computer in the lobby.

This was not a problem for us, the room was very clean and nicely decorated and served it's purpose well since we mainly needed a room just to sleep in. The people in the room next to ours did keep us awake one night watching musicals on tv rather loudly past one in the morning, but since there is a Walgreens right on the corner of the block we ran down and bought ear plugs and the problem was solved. I'm not sure if the walls are thin or if the tv volume was just loud enough that it couldn't be prevented but like I said it was easy enough to solve the problem. There are plenty of restaurants and shops around the hotel and the Union Square area and since we don't mind walking we actually walked to places like Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39, Chinatown, and Ghiradelli Square everyday.

But if you like Europe, you will LOVE this hotel.  All the little touches really added up -- the thick monogrammed towels, the adorable rubber ducks for the bathtubs, bowl of fresh apples in the lobby, platter of cookies next to the complimentary coffee all day, jar of candy in the room.  It is all about atmosphere, not whether you can do a cartwheel in your room!  And we had just a standard room -- they have suites and specialty rooms available.  The only reason I would not give this a full \"5\" is because the lobby bartender looked like he was on sedatives and was slow and not very personable; also, they are upgrading 1 of 2 elevators so it is a bit of a wait.

Its next door neighbor is the Border's bookstore.  I loved browsing books there before going back to my room.\n\nThe room was clean.  The bathroom was good size with a full size bathtub.  They also had free HBO.  When you check in, make sure to ask for a room on the back.  My room was on the street side.  Although I had very good view of The Drake Hotel, Union Square, and Macy's, I could hear the street noise (including the cablecar's bells) from the ninth floor.  It you are a light sleeper, it may not be comfortable for you.\n\nThe elevators were very tiny and slow.  They can only hold six people at a time.  During my stay, one was under repair.

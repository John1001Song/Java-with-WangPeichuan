The hotel was located right on a cable car route which was very convenient. Since my Mom found cable car rides to be her very favorite thing in San Francisco, the proximity to the cable car turnaround was great. When we checked into the hotel I requested a higher floor on the quietest side since my Mom has a hard time sleeping. Diana at the front desk spent some time finding us a different room which turned out to be an upgrade. She did not charge us an upgrade fee which was wonderful. Our room was very quiet and we were most appreciative. The beds were very comfortable. I enjoyed being able to grab a glass of wine in the lounge downstairs and take it to our room. If in San Francisco again, I would definitely consider staying at this Marriott.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"Location, Customer Service and Comfortable Bed","negativeRemarks":"Bathroom floor could have been cleaner and tub drained slow.

They deducted $500 extra when I got there in case I used room service. Imagine that. Must be illegal, but they do it. Then I checked my bank account a few days later and the Marriott had also charged an extra $300 on my debit card, for a total of $800 in extra charges for nothing. I went to the front desk and the lady working at the front desk told me I need to use a credit card rather than a debit card because otherwise the hotel just keeps making fake charges, they just do is - I guess cause they can. You get your money back when you check out but they had $800 of my money tied up for 5 days for nothing, in case I used room service. Next, they didn't change the sheets for 3 days. Housekeeping shows up at 3 p.m. and they just press the wrinkles out of the sheets and leave same sheets on the bed. They finally changed the sheets after three days, another maid came in early and changed the sheets. They are so cheap, they give you 2 tiny pieces of paper and a pen. That's it. No writing pad, no replacement pad when they do housekeeping. They did not vacuum the room either. They are so cheap they don't like to replace the empty box of face tissue. It's a good location, very high price, bad housekeeping, bad service all the way around, and they run up big charges on your debit card for no reason.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":2,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"Location","negativeRemarks":"Housekeeping.

The beds are extremely comfy and the rooms are plenty big. The bathroom was pretty small, but it really wasn't a problem. There is also a large desk and sitting area near the window. The rooms have internet, but it is ethernet and expensive. There is no refrigerator. I would recommend looking for a deal at this hotel over the next couple of months while they are still renovating the lobby. It feels like a really expensive hotel, but right now you can stay here for a reasonable price. There are also coupon codes out there to help lower the price of this hotel even further. The location is fantastic. You are one block from Union Square; a short walk to the ferry building, the business district, Chinatown, and North Beach; and, close to the BART and Cable Cars. I read another helpful review that suggested calling to request a specific bed size and higher floor. I did this and was redirected from the front desk to a message system and was pretty leery. But, I left a message anyway and they got back to me promptly AND granted my requests once I got to the hotel. My reservations changed from a double bed to a king bed and I was placed on a high floor on the north side of the building with a great view of the Bay. All in all it was a great hotel and I would definitely recommend it.

I booked a double/double room for 4 people, 2 adults and 2 children and it was great, the beds are an overside double and the room huge. The hotel is in an excellent position, 1 block from Union Sq! Also on the adjacent corner there is Lori's Diner, an original American Diner, great food, service and price, lots of fun. On the other corner is a Walmart, handy for drinks and snacks. The only negative was that the staff on Reception always seemed to be unhappy, if you asked them a question you felt like you were in their way.

The hotel is undergoing a remodel which is probably why I got such a great deal for it. It is very conviently located in the heart of Union Square and only a couple of blocks from the Powell St. Bart station. My only real complaint was that parking is ridiculously expensive ($50+ per night), but it is like that everywhere in San Francisco. I would recommend parking your car at a different lot, there are cheaper ones around in the area (ranging $30-$40 a night) or not brining a car at all if possible. My other complaints are minor ones, there is no full length mirror in the room so my friend and I stood on the bed to see ourselves in the mirror. Also, the bathroom has just a sliding glass door which doesn't much provide much privacy.

A call to the front desk immediately got us an upgraded room (family suite) with plenty of apologies. I suspect my first desk clerk was just a little tired. No regrets, the room was wonderfully large enough to accommodate my teenage daughters explosion of clothes and travel supplies. The hotel is on the cable line with a stop on the corner. Rides to Market Street were almost unnecessary because five blocks downhill was nothing. Coming home or going to the piers was easy with the cable line. My only regret is my room looked directly at The Cheesecake Factory two blocks away on top of Macys. I think I resisted one night out of four, going to sleep without a slice of \"sin\" ruining my diet. For those needing a workout facility, the hotel's is being remodeled. They give you a \"comp\" card for 24 hr fitness five blocks away. It wasnt offered at first but seemed to be no problem once I asked. Do eat at \"Sears fine foods\" across the street and down the block (visible from the front door). Their mini Swedish pancakes are fantastic. French toast was pretty good as well. Overall, I think I enjoyed the best medium budget version of a downtown hotel. You can spend less and get a lot less.

The king sized bed was comfortable and clean, and the room was a nice size for SF. The bathroom , though clean, was outdated and needed modernization. We were on the 19th floor and had no issues with street noise. Very safe, convenient location and great access to the cable cars.

I had an allergic reaction to the linen both nights I was there but the staff was friendly about it, offered to change the linen and even change us rooms. But still, I couldnt escape the linen; so if you have sensitive skin, pack your own linen! The hotel is in an excellent location. It costs us about $8 to get to the wharf by taxi; Macys and all the shopping you can handle is about a block away.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Fresno","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-01-09T06:41:27Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]}]}}}

Hotel was also in a fantastic location right near union square (obv) and the start of the cable car line. However we had an internal room with no window or view. We didn't mind missing out on the view, however the only way to get fresh air was to turn on the EXTREMELY loud aircon unit. We could hardly sleep because of the noise but needed it on overnight, otherwise it was way too hot and stuffy. The ceiling fan was too slow to make any difference. Also the shower curtain was designed so badly, you couldn't bring the curtain all the way around to the shower head side (to keep water in the bath / shower area) without being exposed on the other side to the main part of the room (I.e. Bed / roommate). Hard to explain, you probably have to see it but in other words, the curtain didn't cover the whole bath. Either water got out or you were in full view of the rest of the room. \r\n\r\nStaff were nice enough and tried to be helpful however there was a small incident where we had to call / go down to the lobby 3 times requesting a new tv remote (was missing when we checked in) before it was brought to our room. \r\n\r\nIf we had a room on the outer section of the building, this review may be a lot better.

If you are in a room that faces the left side of the building, you are able to see them at their stopping point.  I would consider the hotel to be a boutique hotel.  I have never stayed in one like it.  I don't know if it is use to be an apartment complex, but it is set up like one.  The rooms are spaced far apart from one another and you can take the stairs or the elevator to get to the the next level.  What I liked is that the hotel was in the middle of the action, but we couldn't hear any of the street noise.  The blackout curtains worked great as we didn't know that morning had come.  The room was clean with very few issues.  There was a stain on the box spring and there were some signs of wear and tear in the bathroom, but other than that it was a great looking room.  The pillows and the bed were very comfortable.  The Wi-Fi was free and it worked well.  There was an issue with the television as all of the stations had a bit of a snowy effect to them.  But for as much as we were in the room that was not a big issue.  The hotel entrance was right between a store where you could buy trinkets and a money exchange location.  You have to be careful because if you aren't looking for it, you could miss it. There are lot of stores located right across and down the street from the hotel, even a pharmacy.  It's a great place if you want to walk.  There are fees that you should be aware of such as the cleaning deposit.

My wife and I have 16 years of forensic experience, and yes, what we saw was blood splatter, and from the location and color of the splatter I would surmise from intravenous needle use.  I also observed staining on the wall in the bedroom, that to be fair I cannot say of that was blood as well.  I collected swabs of the suspected blood splatter from the bathroom and called the front desk.  The manager was not working so we were moved to another hotel room.

Why need a window then?  What bothered me most was the smell of the room. The room smelled very musty and gave me a huge headache.  All you have is a ceiling fan which won't do enough to cool down the room when it is already hot in there with no air.  I was there for 4 nights, tried to change rooms once but there was no availability at the time during my day 2 stay. I decided to just suck it up.  The room was so small I couldn't even move around and the sink was outside the bathroom too so there was no room to really put any of your stuff around besides on your bed. I'm only 5'2 and slim and I'm complaining about being too small.\r\n\r\nTrying to find the source of my headache I realized what was making the room smell so bad. It was from the alley chimney.

Located right beside Powell cable car terminus and 1 block from BART - couldn't be more convenient.\r\n\r\nThis is a 100 year old hotel, so the rooms are really small (~14'x18' or so?) but everything works and the furnishings and decor have been updated. We took an inside room rather than streetside due to concern about noise. It was pretty dark and there was no view (inside rooms look into the central outdoor 'atrium' across to other rooms 20' away; this is a typical historic ventilation strategy), but it was QUIET and there were no privacy issues. We slept like logs. \r\n\r\nIt was January, so we didn't turn on the through-window air conditioner, but I am guessing that would have been a bit noisier. Might be a good idea to bring earplugs just in case, or if you'd like a street view.\r\n\r\nNote that the hotel is right downtown, so there is a pretty wide population demographic represented - my 8 year old daughter was a little worried about some of the more unpredictable homeless residents around the Union Square area, and had a lot of questions in general about the people sleeping or sitting in doorways (but not our hotel doorway!!).

I found that most hotels shared complaints about thin walls, outside noise, room temp, and parking fees. Basically these are general issues when traveling to any bigger city and looking to find affordable rooms while staying in a great central location. Through reading reviews of this hotel and overlooking the general complaints and ultra nitpicky reviews, I went with my gut and a gamble and booked with Hotel Union Square. JACKPOT!!!!! Not only were the rooms very clean and upkept (great job of updating decor and room condition in what I'm sure is a vintage building), but the service was PERFECT!! Our late night checkin with Coffee(that's her name!!) was simple, smooth, and the room given to us was perfect! Yes room sizes aren't gigantic but you're in the city to explore and be out and about so get over it! Tom at Concierge helped us with bike rental information and discounts to bike the bridge and was always informative on places to eat/drink/coffee! Rooms were always clean, service staff upon encounter was always friendly and smiling! The hallways, decor, lobby, and walls gave the hotel an awesome urban boutique clean feel. Our last day we were assisted in booking shuttle to the airport and our bags were held safely while we did last minute shopping! We absolutely would stay again and again. Thank you to the great team at Hotel Union Square.

I am a fan of boutique hotels and prefer them to the big chains. I knew as soon as I got to the room that I didn't like this hotel. The room had a horrible musty smell and was so dark. I was in a large room on the 6th floor, facing away from the street so noise was not an issue. The furnishings in the room were shabby - the couch and chair were dirty - though the bathroom was fine and the shower was great. The worst part was the bed - I think that's where the musty smell was coming from! The mattress smelled, the sheets were terrible and I was itchy the entire night! I didn't sleep a wink. Although I didn't see bugs in the bed - I did check - I felt like something was crawling all over me the whole night. It was also hot in the room - and then too cold - because the window air conditioner did not have a temperature sensor. I checked out and moved to another hotel the following morning. The front desk person did offer me an upgrade but I just couldn't stomach sleeping there another night. For the same price I moved to the Hotel Nikko, just around the block and I felt like I was in paradise. I realize there is something to be said about the predictability of a large chain hotel. Do yourself a favor and don't stay at the Hotel Union Square.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":1,"ratingHotelCondition":1,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":1,"positiveRemarks":"Nothing.","negativeRemarks":"New mattresses, new sheets, new furniture, better air circulation/ temperature regulating system.","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"MT","reviewSubmissionTime":"2014-04-11T17:38:04Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Melissa","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"23395","reviewId":"68702041","photos":[],"itinId":"171381906388","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"sue","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great location","reviewText":"The room was a little small, but overall, clean and nice.

The AC did not work, it was a window mounted unit and when you set the temp low, it jumped back up to a higher temp. It was extremely stuffy and the energy in there was very strange. We felt trapped, because they lock the cars after 2:00am and you can’t leave until 6:00am. The neighborhood was not safe at night. We actually left the building before six to get out and get some fresh air, walked to a Starbucks and waited until after six, went back and checked out.

The hotel is on the same city block as Macys (w/ Cheesecake Factory) and the actual Union Square park. The trolley passes in front of the hotel, and stops on the corner. Walk one block south and there is the SF Centre Shopping Mall (on Geary St.), which is huge! You can spend an entire day in the mall (w/ movie theater), if you're a shopaholic. There is an abundance of restaurants, bars, shopping nearby. Now, the only slight downside was the hotel rooms. We had to remind ourselves that the hotel is considered a boutique hotel, so it's more about the style vs. the sq. footage. The hallways are narrow and the standard rooms do not boast size, but rather style. (The bed was definitely comfy.)

The location can be both a plus and a minus. While Union Square is right outside your door, this brings along all of the noise and activity that comes with it. We had a room overlooking Powell Street and between the cable cars running until 12:30 am and people yelling, I had to sleep with earplugs both nights we were there. Also, the Union Square does not have air conditioning, so it's not like you can close the windows and turn the A/C on to drown out outside noise. However, there was a nice ceiling fan over our bed. With earplugs and because the bed was so comfortable, I slept pretty well.\n\nOur room was probably the smallest room we've had in our three trips there and reminded me of hotel rooms in London. The front desk said they'd normally offer an upgrade, but those rooms were all sold out. We had a very comfortable queen bed and a small contemporary dresser. No desk or chair for working, but the hotel offers complimentary wi-fi access. Our bathroom was long, narrow and not well-lit.\n\nThe staff at the Union Square are exceptional, from the registration desk to the bellman to housekeeping. However, I thought I might have left something at the hotel and left a message with the director of housekeeping, who never returned my call.\n\nThis hotel worked for us 20 years ago, but as we discovered another newer, nicer, quieter hotel a block away for the same price, I would consider that option first.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Kansas City, MO","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-05-19T14:38:10Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"23395","reviewId":"17831999","photos":[],"itinId":"318422792","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Darrin","brandType":"Expedia","title":"A charming and well run boutique hotel in the tourist area","reviewText":"Room was small but adequate.

Also I was on the main street with street cars ringing their bells and screeching their brakes every 5 minutes. I finally asked to get moved to another room, which took them 60 minutes, when they said it would take 10. It was in the far back of the hotel, so noise no longer became an issue. However the beds where very uncomfortable for me. I had about 2 hours of sleep, mostly interrupted and was a mess at my conference the next day. For the most part the rooms where clean, and the front desk staff was courteous, but I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. I told the speaker at my conference about where I was saying, and he said, \"Ouch, Yeah I have stayed there before, it is horrible.\"","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":1,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Fresno","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-03-05T21:36:40Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"23395","reviewId":"17831963","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"John","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great Value","reviewText":"The hotel was undergoing construction, so this evaluation is a little tainted.

Staying here frees you from having to rent a car because all the transportation you need to get anywhere is right there. HOWEVER, it must be a drag staying here in the height of Summer. There is no air conditioning in the rooms. Luckily, the weather in San Francisco keeps it comfortable, but for those who like a colder climate this may be a little uncomfortable. The activities of San Fran will more than compensate that though. It is an older hotel, doesn't offer much as the 5 star hotels do, but its historical significance, as being the first boutique hotel, and being a place where historical incidences occured becons visitors to come and stay with them. I do suggest though if you're here on business, request a room on a higher floor. The bell ringng of the cable cars can be heard especially if your room is facing Powell Street.

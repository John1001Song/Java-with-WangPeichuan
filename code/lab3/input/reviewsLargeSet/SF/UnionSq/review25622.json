I couldn't even tell this was an upgraded room. She gave me an attitude, and inferred I was lying. After a few minutes of this, she said she'll check my paperwork, and what I signed.

We choose this hotel because of a great deal from Expedia. It was a large hotel and we would ordinarily stay in a much smaller hotel.\r\n\r\nCheck-in was smooth and only took 10 minutes. The room was large and clean. We were on the 9th floor in Tower 2 overlooking O'Farrell Street and the car park opposite.\r\n\r\nThe hotel is currently undergoing renovations. Because of this and the large number of corporate guests, it was impossible to get a seat in the lobby before 9pm in order to access the free wi-fi. \r\n\r\nBecause of the renovations, the bar was relocated to the restaurant on the 46th floor of Tower 1. The views of San Francisco from the bar are amazing. However, unless you are staying in Tower 1, the journey to the bar is not easy. We visited the bar on 6 occasions. The bar featured the strangest aspect of our stay. On all 6 occasions, we were served our beer in long, slim glasses. It became apparent by our 3rd visit that all of the corporate guests were being served beer in regular pint glasses. We came to the conclusion that the bar staff had implemented a coding system to distinguish between the corporate guests and the tourists. Why they would choose to do this is not clear.\r\n\r\nOverall, the hotel was fine although it was large and difficult to navigate. The location was excellent.

The cabinet where the mini-bar and refrigerator would normally be was locked closed. They also didn't bother to put in fresh rolls of toilet paper in the bathrooms when I checked in.

Most of the staff that I dealt with were very rude and unaccommodating to my needs. I booked a Jr. Suite to make sure our room was nice. In the renovated tower. For some reason they sent me to the wrong (old) tower twice. One of the rooms they even sent me to was being worked on by maintenance. I can not walk that well due to a recent accident, so this task for me was hard. The last time I waited in line to change rooms (for the third time) the staff (Jeffery) kept on rolling his eyes at me about the room and told me to come back in a few hours. I went outside and called the hotel and spoke to a manager. To find the room was ready, he was lying and I could check in at any time. This was close to 4-4;30pm, when I was trying to check in all morning. After getting the correct room and taking my luggage up I was very happy with the room. The room is crazy big, really nice, clean and new. We ended up staying there for the remainder of our trip. It was worth all the fighting with the staff at the hotel to get a new Jr Suite over the old one. I'm glad I stood my ground and fought for it. The walls were a little on the thin side, where you could hear your neighbors, but that would be the only think I would mention that was bad with the room. Everything else was great. I would definitely stay there again but make sure to be firm with the staff from the beginning.

When I arrived, my room wasn't ready, waited about 10 minutes and was then given vouchers for the full buffet breakfast at Urban Tavern for my entire stay. Nice!

The self-parking structure was designed poorly. Although I was always able to find a stall (several floors up) cautiously navigating that tight narrow corridor of the structure took some time. (Parking structure is attached to Tower 3, when you walk out of the garage to your room you must walk through the room hallways of tower 3 to get to the lobby which was kinda odd)\r\nRoom cons? Coming from the Hyatt house in Emeryville, (which had a full kitchen, microwave, full size refrigerator, plates, cups, utensils, etc) this room at the Hilton only had a small refrigerator and a coffee maker. <- standard I guess.

The vent in the bathroom was coated with dust and the shower had little pressure! The A/C in new room also did not cool adequately. The thermostat let you lower it to ~50 something but did not cool.

The security guards just shaked their heads and stood there and kept reminding us that nothing can be done and the security cameras (two of them facing our vehicle) would not capture any evidence. Basically they were not willing to even make an attempt to review the security tapes, and I am yet to hear back from the security director of the garage about any follow up, let alone compensation for the key information and assets that were stolen. Yes we were given a voucher for breakfast buffet and a free room service (thank you Hilton). If the parking garage at hotel does not take responsibility for this, why are they charging as much as $48-$58 per night? This is unethical and unprofessional. Do the security cameras truly capture anything? Or are they there to give you a false sense of security? And this happened in broad daylight in the afternoon.

They won't be the cheapest- but the beds are always comfortable, bathrooms clean with a pool or family space.  Given we had just come from Hilton San Diego- this was a very disappointing, and uncomfortable 3 days in San Fransisco. \r\nFirst of all, we arrive at the hotel through the back entrance after Google directed us through the tenderloin district= Smell+ fear+ filth. When we arrived, no hello help or welcome. Just stand there and watch us try to figure it out. Then checking in was long... The concierge possibly got the same training. When asked for ideas on how to see the city, and whether they could make recommendations for we got a very snappy \"What tour bus?\" When we described the several hop on/ off tours outside the hotel door..\"Just get on a red one- they are all red anyway.\"  \r\nThe cleaning was appalling.  I wiped down the bathroom on our arrival before use -showers need bleach; on day 2 we arrived to find a whole hallway with their rubbish outside their doors at 5.30pm, when cleaning starts at 8.30am (and they won't knock).  Essentially Tower 3,  Level 8 is still stuck in the 1970's complete with carpet stains, peeling wall paper and damp smell to match. \r\nWatch out if you need to go out the front door-  be prepared for more homeless begging/ abusing you while the hotel staff look on","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":2,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"The San Fran Ginger Bread display in the vhotelk lobby","negativeRemarks":"Attitude.

The downside is that tends to be overcrowded, with lines for check in and check out and a limited attention span of the staff for any individual customer.

The parking fee is through the roof and easily doubled the cost of my rental car, with cheaper independent garages nearby. Because I stayed at this hotel only for the first two nights of a conference and then moved to one with the same nightly rate on Nob Hill, I have to say that there was just no comparison and the Hilton pales into insignificance in every dimension (breakfast, exorbitant Internet connection fees, view, comfort, ...).

The sink was so narrow and close to the edge, when washing my face or hands I ended up with more water on my toes then in the sink. The shower, toilet and open area in front of the sink were so close together that it was awkward to get ready in the morning. Trying to blow dry my hair, I either hit the glass shower door or the toilet with my elbows. There is no counter space in the bathroom, unless you wanted your toiletries against the toilet tank, which in my opinion is unsanitary. The electric plugs were also in a bad location for the bathroom, once plugged in to the outlet (which is deep into a small wooden shelf) you had no place to set your blow dryer or curling iron. Unless you have an extra-long cord you would have to hold it or place it in the sink.

We came to visit San Francisco as a small weekend getaway from school and work. We arrived on Friday afternoon around 2pm and was able to check in early rather than 3pm. I booked a one bedroom with a King bed. When we got up to the room, it was clean and pretty cozy. The view was pleasant as we were able to see cars and people passing. When checking out the room, I realized that the bathroom door hinge was broken and there was a piece missing where the lock was supposed to be. I did not think it was that big of a deal so I did not bother calling it in. My friend and I left for dinner around 5pm. By the time we got back to the hotel, it was already around 10pm and we decided to watch some TV. I noticed that the channels were staticy and jumpy (as in the pictures would freeze and skip every time). This got annoying and we thought it would go away after awhile. About 20 minutes has passed and it kept on freezing on every channel so I decided to call the front desk for some assistance. Even though it was close to midnight, they were able to send a technician up to try and fix the problem. The technician came within 10 minutes and he said the connection was bad and someone can come in the morning to fix it. He was able to adjust the wiring so that the problem was fixed. He felt bad and gave us 2 complimentary full breakfast vouchers. Overall, a great hotel with great service.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"I liked the friendly staff and modern feel.

This is my second time in this hotel and may be my last. Don't get me wrong, it is a very nice hotel, just off Union Square, but the rooms are small even after paying $40 per night for an upgraded room. What the $40 got me was a WIFI connection which I could have purchased for $16.95. Most hotels offer it for nothing but this is San Francisco. The staff was great and check-in and check-out was easy and expedient. . The room was the same size and configuration as the basic room on my earlier stay. The room was very clean, plainly appointed with a very comfortable bed. The bath was very small with the basin partially over the tank of the toilet. The shower was nice and fairly large with nice towels. Parking was $52 dollars per night plus tax which actually brings it to almost $60.

But the overall experience is that of an overly large corporate conference hotel, with cold corporate service, and some annoying touches (like a leaking bathroom ceiling). You are paying for a lot of business facilities that you probably won't use. My main gripe would be that you have to pay for internet access in the room (I had to select a special rate for 'free' wifi, which was about 12 bucks a night more), but the wifi connectivity (or bandwidth) is not able to support the number of people using it, so you are constantly losing your internet connection. Constantly having to sign in through complex splash pages is also a pian. Smaller hotels handle internet access so much better. (Internet access was better in the lobby, but in a hotel this size you don't want to have to go down to the lobby every time the internet drops off in your room.) The \"breakfast\", included free, was just a voucher to use at the Starbucks in the lobby, where everyone else in the hotel is also lining up (about 20 people in line most mornings). If this was the Holiday Inn it would be OK, but you are paying about double that rate. It should be possible to find a better experience for a lower rate.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"Close to the BART.","negativeRemarks":"The terrible internet connectivity.

I liked that the check-in line was practically non-existent especially that the lobby was busy and full of people (in a good way). The hotel has 3 towers.

(you have to give your best sad-puppy-face in order for the clerk to \"double-check\" if any of the tower 3 rooms are available after he's told you that they're all sold out)\nThe rooms are pretty tiny compared to ,say, Vegas hotels but it's not horrible. We were a family of 5 and we were ok. Just don't stay in too long or else you're gonna start taking out your claustrophobia on each other. The room was clean and tidy with the usual/basic amenities (it was missing q-tips though and i know a few people that care about that). There was a working mini-fridge that you can use at liberty. The beds weren't the most comfortable, especially the pillows. the pillows were a little too soft and \"mushy\" for my liking.\nWe had Thanksgiving dinner at The Urban Tavern (hotel's restaurant) and it was pretty good. No complaints there. It was a set menu so I didn't get to try their regular menu.\nAnother plus is that there's a Starbucks in the lobby.

The wall paper was peeling from the walls around the window, the carpets were stained (big stains), and the desk chair was dirty. We requested to be moved right away and were told that we could not until the next day as there were no rooms available. (They continued checking guests in all night long so I found that hard to believe :)) If this happens to you I recommend that you go down and talk to someone in person rather than on the phone as you get better service and I believe that we would have been moved the same night if I had done that.\n\nThe next room we had was on the 19th (highest) floor overlooking the pool area. The room was in better condition that the first one. The bathrooms are very small though and the shower had very low water pressure.\n\nThe location is good if you are interested in shopping, however, I think I would choose to stay closer to fisherman's wharf next time.\n\nI was actually shocked at the number of homeless people in the area. Very sad.....\n\nThe line at Starbucks is quite long in the morning, but it moves really quickly so I would just wait in that line rather than go down the street.\n\nThe pool is heated but it closes very early at 9 o'clock. Also, there seemed to be a lack of towels every time we did try to go down.\n\nOverall, I wasn't too pleased with my experience here. I expected a lot more from a Hilton and was disappointed.

Check in took nearly an hour and the line only seemed to get busier, it was frustrating to see baggage staff stand around and not help to move the check in line along. There 3 different towers all with different elevators. However when waiting at your tower only specific lifts can take you to specific levels. This can make it hard trying to get elevator. Once you have managed to pass the elevators you are confronted by a very cold and long hallway. Unfortunately for us our room was the last room on that level right next to the ice machine. Once in our room you shuffle into a tiny tiny room that has only standing area apart from the beds. Being three of us with suitcases we had to move furniture around to make all our bags accessible. However in doing so we where unable to get around one bed and had to move a chair in between the two beds. This is how small the room was for 3 ppl imagine if there was 4.\nOnthe positive side the staff where all very friendly and nice and helped us out with all our needs even when we required a doctor.

The smell continued on day two and the front desk staff provided me with a \"free breakfast\" for the inconvenience. But the smell was HORRIBLE. On day three they sent up an ozone machine. Unfortunately the smell never subsided despite open windows for three days I contacted a manager, and asked him to please identify the source of the odor and to tell me what caused the smell and after a long conversation I convinced him to spend 10 minutes to check it out. He sent the floor manager and called me back after I had checked out, He said all the rooms in Tower 2 smell like that - and that is why they are renovating Tower 2 - it is just old he said and the smell in my room was not worse than any others .I asked him if the hotel had complaints from any other guests if the rooms all smelled this way.

This impacts the wait at the elevator and to the starbucks coffee shop and restaurant, checkin/checkout, taxi's and other similar services. To the credit of the Starbucks employees, they kept an efficient operation and a constant line of 20 more people moving and down to about a 10 minute wait to order and get your drink.

The Starbucks in the lobby is small, understaffed & open limited hours. The associated bar & restaurant is okay quality with a high price tag.

We left from Los Angeles late Friday evening and did a few things along the way before showing up at the hotel around noon. We asked if we could check in early as we were so tired and had no sleep yet. Without a second thought they went ahead and checked us in. It was very nice and considerate of them to do that. After a nap and a bit of freshening up we went down to the concierge for any site seeing tips and they had great suggestions. We ended the night drinking at a nearby pub and watching all the interesting costumes that passed by (it was holloween weekend).\nThe room was very clean and appeared to be newly remodeled, however, the size of the room seemed a bit small for 4 people.

Here are some tips and suggestions for enjoying your stay. Buy a muni multi day passport. It in good for Cable cars, Street cars, Buses, and the train within the city. This will keep you from having to always pull out you wallet. You can buy these on Powell and market. We bought the three day. One way on the cable car alone is $5 each person. You do the math. Macy's and Westfield mall have food courts in the basement levels. Plenty of choices. I ate at Wolfgang Pucks express in Macy's and had the best meatloaf sandwich ever. There is this place called Tommy's Joint thhat has been in the same location for a long, long time. Outstaning hand carved sandwiches on sourdough bread. They are on the corner of Van ness and Geary. The decore is great to look at and a great bar. Try it. Sad to say the homeless problem is still big in SF. But the Hotel has plenty of security that they don't bother you.

I understand this is San Francisco, but my room here was smaller than one at a lower quality chain I stayed at last month. And it wouldn't kill them to put a lock in the bathroom door.\nSecond, altough it is conveniently located near Union Square you MUST take a right towards it when leaving the hotel. The left is a completely different world, one you might not be too comfortable in, specially after sundown.\nThe third thing is that they charge ridiculous prices for everything other than the room (parking, wifi, minibar, etc.). If you want to make a fair calculation of the price, take the nightly fee and add 50 dollars for parking, 15 for wifi - and 7 dollars if you take a bottle of water (water!) from the minibar, which at least in my room, wasn't even cold.

I was also shocked to find that there is no free Internet, which I would expect at a hotel of this caliber. Internet was another $13 a day.

When booking we opted for the special that included the breakfast at the Urban Tavern next door - a trendy place with a truly amazing breakfast buffet. The baked Greek Yogurt shots were yummy! Eggs, bacon, salads, potstickers and much more. If it wasn't in a package we wouldn't have had the buffet - it's expensive. Self-parking was only $5.00 less than valet and the prices are not posted as far as I could see so be sure to ask. It is a bit confusing in San Francisco traffic because there is not a lot of loading-zone parking in front of the hotel if you want to off-load before parking, and you have to go around the block to access the garage.

And the pool is small and not lit at night so that even though it's open until 9 p.m., you're swimming in pitch black after 7 p.m. A terrible, terrible disappointment from a four-star hotel that really felt more like a three-star, and not a good one at that.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":2,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Victoria, BC","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-10-10T20:14:38Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"25622","reviewId":"18442544","photos":[],"itinId":"294285109","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Matt","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great Hotel","reviewText":"Location and service","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-10-10T02:41:52Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"25622","reviewId":"18441889","photos":[],"itinId":"285616637","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Yimmy","brandType":"Expedia","title":"A Great Location","reviewText":"Very nice, great location a few blocks from the bart.

They did take it off without any argument, but it made me wonder how they supposedly monitored it. I did look into the fridge to consider putting a bottle of water I'd bought elsewhere in there and couldn't because it's so tightly jam packed with their drinks - nothing else would fit. Note for naive travelers: I did not see any Notice in or around the fridge that any of the drinks inside would cost you big time - but I knew better - that's why I bought my own from outside the hotel.

After check in, and a ride up to our floor, we were glad to have a place to relax for a bit after our flight. As we enter the room a gust of warm air seeps out as it was quite warm and stuffy inside. A window was quickly opened and then the air turned on and within 5 minutes it was nice in the room. The view was great, but the bed was a bit soft for my liking which i do understand were all different. My back was a bit uneasy throughout my stay, but it didn't keep me from enjoying all that San Francisco has to offer. Everything else was great, we never took advantage of the free breakfast but it was nice to have the option. Also having a Starbucks inside was fancy and a nice added treat. Our only complaint was at night the surrounding rooms were very loud as we were able to hear conversations, TV, foot steps, toilet, shower, sink, opening of drawers, pretty much everything.

It's a really good hotel, great location (if you are hoofing later at night, try to walk in the Union Sq direction, and not towards the Tenderloin, at least not past Taylor St, to avoid unsavoury characters), literally within walking distance to major shopping and dining district. Maybe because our room was tucked away from the elevator area, it was one of the quietest hotel experiences we had, ever. Also we didn't experience any of the sound isolation issues mentioned in the other reviews. Housekeeping service was quite good, the check-in process was smooth and effortless, and so was the check-out. The only problems: terribly overpriced mini-bar ($8 for a bottle of Fiji water is a shame. Mini bars are overpriced all over the world, but come on, the hotel could very well make 300% profit by pricing it at $4!) The Urban Tavern breakfast is shamelessly overpriced too. Do NOT go there. Ponzu restaurant breakfast on the corner of O'Farrel and Taylor is a much better choice. Overall: I will definetely stay at this hotel again.

I arrived (for one week) on Thanksgiving Day. When I last stayed there the hotel had a multitude of restaurants, a small shopping arcade and a nice bar. On my return I discovered that they have ripped out the bar, the restaurants and the shopping arcade to make way for a multitude of convention rooms. All very well perhaps if it's a convention that you're attending (and not planning on doing anything else in the hotel). The large (once graceful) lobby now serves as a makeshift lounge area where, in the corner, a tacky makeshift bar is erected in the evening - to compliment the equally tacky Starbucks positioned where once the bar was. Add to this the utilitarian \"Urban Tavern\" with its garish uninviting and clinical ambience and one is left with a feeling that the Hilton is more about accommodating franchises and concessions than about creating an overall \"Hilton\" experience. A once great hotel sadly relegated to a hotel in search for the quick'n'easy convention buck.

I was looking forward to staying here for 3 nights to attend a conference. Maybe I picked one of the most busiest weekends - the wait to check in even in the preferred Hilton Honors line was absolutely ridiculous. The lobby's activity (congestion) reminded me of a Vegas hotel. The worst part of my stay was the constant wandering of noisy people going up and down the hallway at all hours of the night and early morning. Not just going back to their rooms, but talking, laughing as if the concern of the other guests didn't matter to them. There was even one lady calling out someone's name -- trying to figure where her room was I guess.The best part of my stay? The Starbuck staff was very efficient and friendly. But that's Starbucks and there's another one in the hotel next to this one.

Overall, we had a good stay. When we checked in, our room smelled like cigarette smoke, even though it was a non-smoking room. We were able to open the windows and air it out. The bathtub was not completely clean. The furniture and beds in the room were clean and comfortable. We did not have any trouble with noise (as commented on by another reviewer), and we were on the 11th floor. The parking at the hotel was rather pricey, but we used it due to convenience. The staff were all very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend dining at the Cityscape restaurant, especially for breakfast.

However, if after site seeing in the area you want to use the hot tub or pool, I wish you luck. The pool opens at 5AM when I sure hope to be sleeping and closes at 9PM when I'm just getting back from site seeing. If you try to go in the morning they are ALWAYS cleaning it and have it CLOSED. So forget about using it between the hours of 8AM and 11AM. The pool should be open until at least 10PM, preferably 11PM and be cleaned during the closed hours NOT during the limited open hours. Everyone in our group had an issue with this. Room service, drinks of any sort or food is very spendy, but it is the Hilton and SF is an expensive place. Buy your coffee at Starbucks up the street and you'll save $2.50 per cup.

The first things that me and my wife noticed when we entered the lobby was the size of the crystal chandeliers, the world globe in the center of the lobby and the leather chairs and sofas that are for your comfort. The hotel room was very comfortable with marble bathroom floor and sink top. 300 thread count sheets with thick goose comforter and very soft bed. It is your guarantee of a comfortable sleep. The room has very stylish wood furnishings and is very comfortable although not very large. The price of the restaurants in the hotel Hilton was a little more then I expected but if you would like a nice view from the cityscape restaurant it is worth the price that you will pay to see the city at night or during the day. The hotel souvenir shop is very convenient and the prices are what you would expect to pay at any souvenir shop. During my stay I made all my purchases at the hotel shop the night before coming home 10 minutes before the shop closed. In my idea Hotel Hilton is a very nice place to stay.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Vancouver","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-07-04T04:41:48Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"25622","reviewId":"18442075","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"jeff","brandType":"Expedia","title":"median hotel in san fran","reviewText":"my girlfriend and i loved the hotel, but when we checked in they failed to communicate to us that the restaraunt would be closed for remodelling. this was an issue for us since i was going to propose there.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"phoenix","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-07-04T03:04:42Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"3","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_gb","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"25622","reviewId":"18442694","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":2,"langId":"2057","userNickname":"Fred","brandType":"Expedia","title":"good location, shame about other factors...","reviewText":"the stay was okay, although a random guy knocked, waited about 10 seconds then just walked into the room and said he had arrived to fix something in the bathroom! he saw us said sorry then left. i assume he was legitimate because we saw the same chap in another room further down the corridor. the service was a bit disappointing, the restaurant was a joke; ye, a great view but thats about it. its a shame that my memories of san francisco are awesome.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":2,"ratingHotelCondition":1,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"London","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-06-30T02:31:02Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"25622","reviewId":"18442081","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Randy","brandType":"Expedia","title":"I will return...","reviewText":"Enjoyed my stay here!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Las Vegas","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-06-29T17:43:43Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"25622","reviewId":"18442080","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Linda","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Would visit again","reviewText":"One day they didn't come to clean room we had to call.

The hotel staff were very courteous and helpful. We arrived before check in time and we asked if there was a room available for us to check into early. They only had one and we were allowed to check into it.Upon arrival at the room, we saw that it was very small and smelled of smoke, and we only had to wait a few minutes in order to change to another room. The new room was much bigger and better. There are no refrigerators or microwaves in the rooms, only a mini bar which is very expensive. You can request a refrigerator, but it will cost you per day.There is a $15 per visit charge to the fitness center, which in my opinion should be complimentary. The pool is very small for such a large hotel. Sanfrancisco is a very expensive city. Do some research to find the best and most reasonably priced restaurants. There are plenty in the area. Be advised, the weather in the city can be very cool. You need to travel with a jacket.The temps were in the middle and upper 60's most of our stay. That was wonderful considering we're from one of the hottest states you can be in during the summer,Texas.Best rooms are in tower 2. Would go back to the city and to the hotel.

Executive Level guests get a morning paper as well as a lovely continental breakfast. When I say continental, believe me this is a better than average continental breakfast (much much more than coffee and a roll). We also had one of the best chicken quesadillas ever down in their lobby sports bar. The Hilton staff was friendly and very accommodating. The location could not be beat...we were a few blocks from the cable car route and within walking distance of Chinatown. The hotel is right next door to some of the best shopping in the west coast!

The city itself was wonderful but if you are there to see the sights, (tourist visit), you are much better off staying nearer Fisherman's Wharf.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Rock Springs.WY","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-06-30T16:08:39Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"25622","reviewId":"18442254","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Karla","brandType":"Expedia","title":"great hotel","reviewText":"Hotel was located in the middle of san francisco near all the shops etc. just a short taxi ride to fisherman's wharf.. hotel restaurant had an excellent breakfast all employees were very courteous and helpful","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Ellijay,GA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-06-24T23:54:33Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"25622","reviewId":"18442258","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Aixa","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Can't wait to go back","reviewText":"The hotel is great.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"San Juan, Puerto Rico","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-06-12T15:35:57Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"25622","reviewId":"18442248","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Lucy","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Will Stay Again","reviewText":"The Hilton San Francisco is a beautiful hotel and within blocks of Union Square.

Read some comments that this hotel was too close to the Tenderloin district. Never found it to be a problem. They have uniformed security ( also very friendly ) at each entrance and near the elevators 24 hours a day. Many times there was a uniformed S.F. police officer outside the main entrance. Never saw anyone in or around the hotel who didn't belong there. Just a block and a half to the cable cars. Near several outstanding restaurants. Walked to these with no problems. Many travelers and business types on the streets. Cable cars will take you to many other restaurants. Room not big but big enough. Eleventh floor. No view but didn't matter.

I got my bags from the trunk of my rental car and had my hands full as I went to the door to enter the hotel. There were two hotel employees in uniform on a smoke break that were too busy to assist me with the door until one of them finally held it open as I was halfway thru. I asked a guard regarding temporary parking while checking in and unloading instead of having my wife wait in the car in an unauthorized area. He told me he had no clue and I should refer my questions to the front desk when I checked in. When we got to the room my wife went to the restroom to wash her face and found the sink was clogged and would not drain. Maintenance did respond quickly, but this is something that the maid should have reported and had taken care of prior to our arrival. It would have been easily spotted while cleaning the sink. Also had difficulties while trying to get a waitress to wait on me for a takeout order at the hotel's grill. The other waitress that was off shift bailed me out.

The restaurants and bar in the hotel are overpriced. $7 or so for a corona, breakfast for two cost us nearly $40.

There are tons of restaurants and shopping all around the hotel. We got so much good information from the hotel staff. Our Bellman who helped us on two different occasions gave us lots of good information. The rooms were nice. But, the beds were one of the most comfortable my husband & I have slept in away from home. We felt very cozy in our room & loved relaxing on a rainy Sunday morning before going out for brunch this morning. BTW- The Target is right  across the street (you can buy your bottled water or snacks for your room there). And they have so many food court choices & even a movie theater if you just want to chill out. I know most people want to do all the tourist attractions & you can also do all of that too.

Several people get so frustrated they move around all the cars and try to cut in at the entrance. When you finally make it, the hotel staff will come to your car and tell you to wait (another 10 minutes), and that the parking fee is $65 - parking in San Francisco is expensive, but $65 is higher than any other hotel (except the Four Seasons). You would think for that much they would hire more people to move things quickly.\r\n2) The lobby of this hotel is like a Las Vegas Casino without the Casino of course. You fee part of a cattle heard as soon as you get in.\r\n3) This hotel has great views at the higher levels, but if you booked your hotel through a travel portal, enjoy the low rise tower and no views.\r\n4) The Sky view lounge looks awesome in pictures. Good luck enjoying it. The closed it down for a private event on a Saturday at 9:00 pm, and they started kicking everyone out at 8:20 pm.

The room had an unusual layout where the bathroom door stuck into the room as you passed. It was easy to bump into. The room had a mini-fridge stocked with bottles of alcohol. I was afraid to touch it so as not to disturb the bottles. I also faced a church next door and every morning at 7:30 you will hear church bells (not just on Sunday). I was usually up anyway but if you want to sleep in that's not going to happen. They were very accommodating about early checkin, and the hotel is close to Market St. and public transportation. It didn't seem to have many choices on restaurants but there are some within walking distance. Overall the hotel seems geared towards business travelers as I was one of the few guys there not wearing business suits. I would give it three and a half stars if I could but I guess I'll round up.

The room was cleaned everyday by Elena, changed bedsheets and brought us extra towels and extra blankets.  Kids enjoyed the pool everynight as well as the gym. Starbucks and bar at the lobby.  You go out Metreon AMC, mall, restaurants are within walking distance.  Ferry Bldg is about 1.4 miles walking.  Public transportation is just steps outside of the hotel.  Parking unfortunately was a bit pricey so we found a parking garage just outside of the hotel on Stevenson & 3rd @ $25/nt.  I have looked at several hotels and compared prices and amenities and SFO Marriott Marquis has the best bang for your $$.  Most hotels in SFO does not have a pool and if they do you will pay resort fee per night (pool, gym etc.) with kids location, htl amenities, eateries, shopping(for me) accessibilities and FREE WIFI is a must- this hotel has it all.

There is a restaurant on the 39th floor with a wonderful view and the food is excellant also. There's 2 Walgreens on Market Street real close to the hotel. If you don't mind paying 8 bucks for a bottle of water then don't bother with them. Personally, I'm a .59 cent a bottle kind of guy. Starbucks in the lobby open until 2pm and many others are close.\n\nMarket and 4th is a great intersection to start from if you are walking around. The beginning of the Powell-Hyde cable car is just a block away. Thats fun for a few times. It's just the wait in line that is bothersome. It takes you near Pier 39 on the other end.\n\nThe F line train runs down market all the way to Pier 39 and back. You must get a Clipper pass at Walgreens for 27 bucks per week. It covers everything you should need. F-line, cable car, bus, just not the BART transit system.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT: Alcatraz tickets are sold out for 2 to 3 weeks in advance. I got mine by talking to the concierge who got them added to a package deal from Blazing Saddles. It was a hop on hop off bus tour that crosses the Golden Gate bridge. Note: Dress warm if you go on the top of the bus! It also goes through the Haight-Ashbury district and the Golden Gate Park.

The place looked nice and they allowed us to check in early which was great as we were travelling with our toddler and I was 7 months pregnant. However our in-room check out did not work. I noticed in the room there were left over items from the guests before us which leads me to believe the rooms were not thoroughly cleaned/checked out. The indoor pool was one of the reasons we selected this hotel as my daughter loves to swim. We were very disappointed with the pool. It was dirty, debris floating, it was COLD, and had an awful smell. We only swam for about 20 minutes and did not use the pool again for the rest of our stay. We unfortunately were woken at 2AM by partiers on our floor. They were standing in the halls yelling and screaming and running up and down. I called security and they did come right up; however the partiers only stopped for a few minutes and then continued to be noisy for the next hour. As we were leaving to check out two days later, there was throw-up in the hallway on our floor by the elevator and beer cans in the elevator. As we got off the elevator in the lobby, there was more throw-up which my daughter almost walked right into. I told the front desk clerk about this and he seemed un-fazed and as far as I could see made no rush to get these things cleaned up.

My husband and I travelled cross-country from VA to SF with two teenage girls for vacation, June 2010. The Marriott Marquis was everything we could have hoped for. Clean, comfortable room -- feather pillows and all! The location was perfect. We walked to lots of fun sight-seeing spots, Chinatown, etc. And we were right around the corner from cable car or street car access and lots of shopping! We also walked to AT&T Park to see a Giants game. Everything was very accessible and hotel staff and employees at stores and venues were wonderful -- helpful and friendly.\n\nThe only negative was the *prices*, especially at the restaurants in the hotel. SF is expensive, but the Marriott's prices were ridiculous. We stayed 6 nights and did not eat at the hotel at all, even for breakfast. We did take advantage of the Starbucks inside the hotel tho!\n\nWe booked a \"wine country\" day trip. A van picked us up at the front door of the hotel - enjoyed the Muir Woods and several wineries in Sonoma. Highly recommended.\n\nThe lounge on the top floor has really spectacular views of the city. We enjoyed a quiet moment, having a sip, looking down over the city lights on our last night in SF. A very special moment. I'm sure the girls will remember it always. Hope we get a chance to return soon.

We had 5 days to spend our time there. Unfortunately, my daughter was very sick with a cold. She didn't get out of bed one day! Went thru boxes of kleenex and felt pretty sick and tired. This was the only bad news we had. When you're stuck in your room due to sickness then, what a room! When you run out of kleenex, what a maid! When you need a treat to eat, what a city!! When you're bored, what great movies in the room! I was only 4 minutes by walking away from the most exciting shopping I've ever been priveledged to. I would go for an hour or two while my daughter slept. We caught buses just outside the door on the days she started to feel a bit better and rode all around the town. Great way to see everything. Firmly recommend the Alcatraz experience. Anyways, back to the hotel, the concierge were so helpful, the location worked out perfectly for us and I would love to go back to see what I missed. Great place to stay and don't miss the top floor \"bar\"...what a view!

Parking was very expensive at the hotel - $55/day and the alternative was $35 across the street that is not secure.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Los Angeles, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-08-26T18:12:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"8737","reviewId":"18515269","photos":[],"itinId":"285974767","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Terri","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great location!","reviewText":"This hotel was in an ideal location.

The street noise was probably there, but nothing that I remember being a big deal. The indoor pool was very nice and my kids enjoyed it almost ever day of our visit! Parking is off the hook ($55 a day) and internet is also extra ($12.95 a day) so make sure you add that to the daily cost! The worst thing about the room is that the $4 candy bars were right there on the table. If you even move them you'll be charged. I stood a book up in front of them so the kids would forget about them and I would remember not to put anything next to them so they wouldn't get bumped.

A women from the front desk and a man came to check on the room as if they didn't believe me and seemed surprised to find I was in deed telling the truth. The room was disgusting.

We used their services several times, from \"where can we get a Coke\" to recommending where to get dinner. Their dinner recommendations where spot on. They were able to send us to places that were within walking distance (5-10 minutes) and not only met the dining experience we ask for, but in every instance exceded them.

When we called they said they would send an auditor who never showed up, but they did reverse the charges. The fancy Sony room alarm clocks are complicated to set up, first time I set it for 6am, it went off at midnight. Just ask for a wake up call.

You do a lot of walking in San Francisco so after a long day, it would have been more convenient to be in a hotel just off the trolley or just around the corner from the fantastic shops. This hotel is still a pretty close walk to everything but after a long day, saving your feet from walking an extra 4-5 blocks might be worth looking into- at least that is what we will look for the next time we plan a trip to San Francisco. Other than that, we thought the lobby was impressive, the concierge very helpful, and the tour service in the lobby very helpful. And we were very impressed with the 2nd floor restaurant. We thought the food there was excellent. The hotel was pretty clean but I wasn't all that impressed with the bed and I thought the bath towels felt rough and thin, but who knows, maybe I was just used to my own fluffy ones.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"San Diego","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-10-16T04:25:17Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"8737","reviewId":"18515208","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Gabriel","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Looks like we found our new SanFran favorite","reviewText":"Having previously stayed across the street and paid nearly the same price for a room 1/4 the size with 1/10 the services, let me save you some heartache and recommend this hotel.

Shower good.  Very nice view across the Moscone Center toward the Bay Bridge from the 16th floor.  Window opened a short amount to let in fresh air.  Car parking was expensive but the car was promptly retrieved by the valet.  We were picking up and dropping off family from various locations so needed a car.Very convenient to the Moscone Center, Union Square, and  Mus. of Modern Art.\nLess Than Positives:  Room was very narrow; there was just enough room for one person to pass between the bed and the desk.  Lobby sucked in cigarette smoke from the smokers congregating outside the entry doors.  Hotel is relatively difficult to get to by car except from the Bay Bridge due to 1-way streets and construction on Mission.  Parking costs are high ($43+/day including taxes).   There is a parking garage across the street with lower rates, but  in downtown SF, parking is costly and street parking nearly impossible to find.  Breakfast was nicely presented but expensive at more than $15 for eggs and toast.\nOverall:  For a single business traveler without a car this is a fine place to stay.  The combination room rate, airfare, and car rental through Expedia made this an easy choice for us for this trip.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Orange County, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-03-01T00:58:59Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"8737","reviewId":"18514752","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Larry","brandType":"Expedia","title":"An excellent staff with a nice environment","reviewText":"Your staff was extremely cooperative and helpful and the environment was quite nice.

The hotel is less than 10 minutes walking distance to SFMOMA (San Francisco Musueam of Modern Art), Union Square shopping, the great Apple showroom, Cable Cars, Macy's with the Cheesecake Factory, Metreon group of theatres, IMAX, and arcades, street chess, over 50 restaurants from around the world, and many other local attractions. The concierge service, restaurants at the Marriott, bar on the top floor, and the coffee shop were all great. You can survive San Francisco without a car and all the parking hassles. Within a day we were able to locate all the BART and CALTrain stations, master the schedule, and commute to Oakland, Berkeley, and Palo Alto from the hotel.  In addition to all these benefits, we also got a significant discount from the rack rate through Expedia.  Next time, we plan a trip to San Francisco, Marriott and Expedia will be on the top of our list.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Iowa City, Iowa","reviewSubmissionTime":"2004-12-12T15:29:17Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"8737","reviewId":"18515145","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Hideaki","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Excellent stay in San Francisco","reviewText":"I could spent excellent nights in Mariott San Francisco.

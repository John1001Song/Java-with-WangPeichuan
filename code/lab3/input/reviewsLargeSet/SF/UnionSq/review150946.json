There was screaming, yelling, loud music and sirens heard all night....then the garbage trucks came at 5 am and dumped all the dumpsters from all the business in the area for a half hour..  This was a very pretty hotel with nice accomendations but the no sleep was painful and unproductive since I was suppossed to get up and run the S.F. Giant race the next morning which I wasnt able to do due to the lack of sleep.

It is clean and decorated very nicely. The beds are super comfortable and the breakfast was great. However, if you want a good night sleep, this is not the place. Music from a bar across the street, trucks, people yelling all kept our family awake all night. That along with the fact that the hotel is almost impossible to find (with a very small sign out front) would have me not recommend this hotel. There are many other better choices in the area for the same price.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"H.","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-09-04T13:19:07Z","roomTypeId":201271308,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":true,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"hotelId":"150946","reviewId":"576d839399fac30b8311b38b","photos":[],"itinId":"1136125329917","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Leah","brandType":"Expedia","title":"New hotel close to Union Square.

The hotel had just opened - it was so new that they didn't yet have permanent signage, and I had trouble finding the place because I wasn't looking for the temporary signage inside the window.

A few days after checking out I noticed a charge for $628.64 from Holiday Inn Express.  I was double charged for the room.  I called Expedia and they said it was not their fault and to call the hotwl.  Called Holiday Inn Express Union Square and spoke with Marcelo who told me that someone made a mistake and it should have been charged to third party \"Expedia\", but only th manager Raj can fix it.  He said he would email Raj to fix it and call me back.  Raj never has called so I filled a dispute with my credit card company.  Neither Expedia nor Holiday Inn Express seem to want to fix the problem...stressful to the customer and poor customer service!!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"R","userLocation":"San Francisco ","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-02-23T12:52:41Z","roomTypeId":201271308,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]}]}}}

Location was awesome, walking distance to Chinatown/little Italy/shopping mall or designer stores/cable train site.  We had to drive to embacadero, so we saved that trip for after checking out.  AWESOME Hotel, using it again when I go back to sf!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-08-01T00:37:38Z","roomTypeId":200162402,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":true,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5883","reviewId":"579c5b4c87f8460b0643c3c8","photos":[],"itinId":"1140621670463","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Overall solid, updated room, excellent staff.","reviewText":"This property has a great location at Union Square and the rooms have been recently updated very nicely.

The other negative is the crazy expensive parking and valet fees.

The hotel is modern, comfortable and has friendly staff. We didn't use many of the services, or even eat or drink in the restaurant/bar, as there are so many cafes and Starbucks close by, so can't comment on those. Nevertheless, staff at front desk were helpful and polite. We had a problem with the blind in our room, mentioned it to the concierge and it was fixed with a friendly note left by the time we returned. The hotel is close to all the shops, and it's a pleasant walk (flat!) down Market Street to the Ferry Building, from where you can walk along Embarcadero and the various piers. We had booked tickets for Alcatraz in advance, and it was a 30-minute walk to Pier 33 from the hotel. You could have taken a street car or bus, but we chose to walk.

If you like shopping at chain stores (think Niketown, Old Navy, Macy's, Banana Republic, etc.), this location is for you. For my family, it was a little overwhelming. The lobby was teaming with people constantly, but once we were up in our room it was very relaxing and quiet, and the city view was stunning. The woman who checked us in gave us a complimentary $100 breakfast credit without any prompting, which was so lovely.\n\nWe did have to switch rooms, however, as there was some (ahem) random hairs on the bathroom floor and towels (which are housed in open cubbies under the sink). But we called housekeeping and they moved us to a room seven floors up immediately and were very apologetic that the room had not been properly cleaned. This incident would not deter me from staying here again, though the crazy-busy location might.\n\nLastly, DO NOT pay for the $62 valet parking. There is a city lot across the street.

The buffet breakfast was pricey at $25pp (plus tax & tip) but it was quite delicious and had the best hotcakes I have ever tried!\nThe location could not have been more central - right by Union Square, the BART train, Macy's, the Christmas tree lights, countless shops etc. There's also a Thai restaurant across the street that is great for a quick and cheap eat, a Starbucks, a Walgreens on the other side of the block, a Chipotle two blocks away and a 24/7 parking complex opposite. The check-in counter was a little unconventional as they have self-check-in services which we were ushered to use but this ended up being counter-intuitive as soon as any minor customization is required beyond spitting out a room key. So we ended up back in the normal \"speak to a human\" queue after the self-check in because we wanted to know if there was another room available.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Sydney, Australia","reviewSubmissionTime":"2013-12-04T05:34:26Z","roomTypeId":200162441,"userDisplayName":"Alison","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5883","reviewId":"62801197","photos":[],"itinId":"165232777766","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Luxury hotel near Union Square.","reviewText":"","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2013-12-03T18:30:58Z","roomTypeId":200162422,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5883","reviewId":"62718374","photos":[{"thumbnailUrl":"https://a.travel-assets.com/ugc/hotel-reviews/2FA8C6DF27CED554F11501BCEE3F57CA2C395318.jpg?resize=100:*","normalUrl":"https://a.travel-assets.com/ugc/hotel-reviews/2FA8C6DF27CED554F11501BCEE3F57CA2C395318.jpg?resize=360:*","caption":"view from hotel room"}],"itinId":"163810790945","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[{"isFlaggable":false,"userNickname":"Tiffany","displayLocale":"en_US","date":"2014-06-07T08:09:50Z","id":"379628","response":"Wow!

Hopped on the trolley to Fisherman's Wharf. Everywhere you went the scenery was amazing. The people in San Fran were friendly and eager to help you. I ran down the Marina towards Golden Gate and a gentleman who lived there his whole life was helpful to lead me to some cool places to check out. I would definitely go back and would love to stay again at the Grand Hyatt. It was just the perfect spot! The Grand Hyatt made my stay in San Fran much more pleasurable.

When I informed the hotel staff that the ice machine was not working, they had it repaired within 4 hours!!! Why am I concerned with ice... I am into fitness and frequently need to ice down after working out. The Hyatt's fitness room was equipped with treadmills, LifeFitness machines and dumbbells up to 50 lbs. Although there is enough equipment to get a good workout, the fitness room is small & it gets over crowded if you go early. I opted for 24-Hour Fitness down the street- I paid daily for this.

The staff was great. The hotel and location were not, even though ESPN Announcers and professional golfers stayed there as well. Very good fitness center and restaurant with great views. There are high end stores nearby, but I got hit up by multiple beggars everyday, and once by a hooker. Transients urinated on the sidewalks in front of you and I witnessed three road rage incidents. Not a location for women to be around or walking. The shower pressure was the worst ever. Spray was about 6 to 7 inches, that's it. Frig broke and replaced with another broken one. The two local Starbucks were packed and dirty and the bums hung out in there and use the same creamers and counters you do. The local restaurants were just OK and the BART was filthy with more transients and people with mental illness. The trolleys take an hour wait to get on. Was on 15th floor but heard street noise all day. The hotel flexes loudly when there is wind due to earthquake design. That woke me up at 2:30 AM. I went to the Wharf and should have stayed there. It was cleaner with more restaurants and variety and views. The tourists were more interesting than the bums downtown and better to get to ATT Park for a game. Take taxis to and from airport at $42.00, its worth it not to ride BART for $8.10. Hyatt does a great job but I would not recommend this location.

First of all, the hotel staff was EXTREMELY helpful and friendly. Also, the concierge helped me with resturants, activities, etc. And she was SUPER nice. Also, I was put on the 21st floor with a new remodeled room and it sure was amazing. Electronic blinds, amazing modern bathroom (a bit on the small side), flat screen TV, lots of work space, cord and cordless phones and super comfy beds. The view from my room also was fabulous. The one thing i did not like was the room was a bit on the small side and there was not much space to store things. But for me it was plenty. Also the location I think is the best in San Francisco, 2 minutes from shopping, across the street from Starbucks and right in downtown. I completely recommend this hotel for couples, singles, or travelers on business, but for families, they should either get a suite or a conjoining room which the Grand Hyatt both has. Overall, this hotel blew my mind, and it was much better than I was expecting.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Canada","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-06-17T16:07:10Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5883","reviewId":"18378944","photos":[],"itinId":"364030930","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"camila","brandType":"Expedia","title":"great hotel, perfect location","reviewText":"great hotel, perfect location","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-06-16T03:36:57Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5883","reviewId":"18378861","photos":[],"itinId":"363618604","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Marc","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Perfect Hotel for Moscone","reviewText":"We attended a conference at Moscone West.

I took the train from SFO and walked to the hotel in just a few minutes. The rooms have been renovated with floor to ceiling windows and a cool bed-side control for the shade. The view from the Grandviews restaurant and bar on the 36th floor is breathtaking. The gym on the 35th floor is fully stocked -- possibly the best hotel gym I have seen.

The bed was wonderful and the pillows comfy, so no complaints about the accomodations over all. We enjoy a soda or snack at night, and it was a huge disappointment to find the honor bar stocked with Diet Pepsi that was at least a month past its expiration date...and it was not all that cold, either. We enjoyed dining at the Grandviews Restaurant on the hotel's 36th floor. The view is indeed grand, the service excellent and the breakfast buffet wonderful. However, on a Sunday morning when the hotel was fairly full (this was Memorial Day weekend, and San Francisco State University had held commencement exercises the day before, which is why we were there) the manager decided not to open the second dining room. As a result, our party of four were kept waiting for nearly 40 minutes for a table. It delayed the start of our day and was not a pleasant experience. In addition, I ordered the smoked salmon/bagel with cream cheese, and the salmon tasted bland, as if it had not even been shown the flame, let alone smoked. It was disgusting, and our waiter never even asked if my good was okay. Our overall stay was very pleasant and the staff capable and friendly.

Then the lady who checked us in held us up for 15 minutes as she didn't understand what rooms we had booked. It was impossible to communicate with her. The hotel room itself was quite nice and fairly comfortable but not really what you'd expect from a four-star. The view was the worst part as we looked out at a building and several rooftops, unable to actually San Francisco. We also had to call a plummer to our rooms everyday as the toilets weren't working properly. I would say the best thing about the hotel was the room service. The staff who delivered it were well-mannered and there was a wide selection of food and drinks. The location of the hotel is also fantastic. There is a Starbucks opposite the street; Macy's and Westfield mall are about a 3 and 6 minute walk; Walgreens is just around the corner and the tour buses stop a minute or two down the road. Overall I would say both the hotel and San Francisco were incredibly underwhelming and I wouldn't recommend either.

The toilet had an auto flush that sounded like a jet liner taking off. And at 4 am that would certainly wake anyone up that may be there in the same room. It could not be turned off either. The 3 (only-not luscious) towels were placed by the toilet not anywhere near the sink or tub. It was just weird. It felt stark and military like which is not what I look for when I go on vacation.

Yet upon check-in, the high standards of service were apparent and the staff welcoming. The receptionist sought out a room with a better view higher up the tower than the one I had booked. I ended up on the 22nd floor with a view across the bay. Yet, unfortuneately for most of my stay it was foggy and I couldn't see beyond Macy's across Union Sq. adjacent to the hotel. Not the hotel's fault! All the staff were courteous,welcoming and paid a great deal of attention to making certain my stay was as comfortable as possible. The beds were very comfortable and the room well laid out and uncluttered. I would suggest that free WIFI internet access comes as part of the cost of the room.

When we returned 90 minutes later, our bags were on the cart still sitting in the lobby. This was very disconcerting to us as we had all our clothes, electronics, cell phones and travel docs in our luggage. We did consume a few drinks from the mini-bar in our room and found via the tv based billing service that we had been charged $26.04 multiple times during our stay for no apparent reason. Hyatt employees were VERY quick to apologize and correct these charges. It just required us to repeatedly check our bill. I will say the employees and specifically the concierge were PHENOMENAL. The concierge assisted us numerous times during our stay including getting our tickets for Alcatraz rebooked because we missed our scheduled time. This is no easy feat and they pulled it off.

My guests and I will never stay here again. For such a beautiful and expensive hotel, I expected quality for what I was paying. I guess it cost extra to get service. We requested towels and 3 calls/3 hours later we got them. Later that night we discovered our TV remote didn't work and requested a new one. No one came. The next morning we called again to replace the remote. The maintenance guy asked why we didn't call sooner. We informed him we did and he said he was never informed by anyone of our request. Well a new cable box later and we had a working TV. Then that morning before we left our room we requested for all our linens and towels to be changed, plus we needed 4 extra towels. Of course later that day when we return the beds were fixed but the linens were not changed and of course no extra towels. Well needless to say we were late to the wedding we were supposed to be at as a result of waiting for extra towels. Last but not least the last straw was when we returned that evening none of our three keys worked to let us in our room. Tired and frustrated we went to the front desk and at that point demanded for a main manager to call us first thing in the morning.

The staff was very courteous and helpfull. The only strange thing we noticed was that you had to purchase through the mini bar the coffee packet to make coffee in the room. Not a big deal but the first hotel that didn't provide the courtesy packets of coffee next to the coffee maker that I've seen. A little frugal for such a nice hotel I thought, not to worry...

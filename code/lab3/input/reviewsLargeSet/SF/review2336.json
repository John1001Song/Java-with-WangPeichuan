After checking into room 361, i quickly noticed that the room is extremely warm even though the AC is on. Then i noticed that the wifi signal is extremely weak and sometimes the hotel wifi network did not even appear on my iphone's wifi available network. I quickly phoned the reception and told them about the wifi and they said the signal should be the same throughout the property (which is a lie obviously) and i should switched my phone off and turned it back on (this is the first i heard anyway that restarting the phone will improve the wifi signal). After trying what i have been told, there was no improvement and the room is still warm even though the AC has been on for more than 30 minutes by now. I called to the reception again and the lady said there is no more room available. I booked the room 2 months in advance and after a long flight, the last thing i want to deal with is endless problems and yet i have been allocated such a lousy room. I was not pleased at all with and decided to forget about the wifi and to use the data roaming. The free wifi network is apparently a joke as it is only working if you are close to where the wireless routers are (not if your room is far away from the routers). I will not return to this hotel again as the staffs made no effort to keep the customers happy and i will not recommend anyone to stay here.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":2,"ratingHotelCondition":1,"ratingService":1,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2013-09-17T21:26:58Z","roomTypeId":274758,"userDisplayName":"Intl Traveller","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"2336","reviewId":"57666465","photos":[],"itinId":"161715141150","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[{"isFlaggable":false,"userNickname":"","displayLocale":"","date":"2014-03-15T06:52:25Z","id":"","response":"Dear verified traveler,\n\nWe would like to take this opportunity to thank you for staying with us and for posting a good review about our hotel.

I just needed a comfy place to relax without paying too much. I didn't expect anything special since all I intended to do was eat and sleep, but I have to admit that I was very satisfied during my stay. The staff is very nice and the King room was comfy and clean. Sure, you might notice some wear and tear here and there, but it wasn't bad enough to affect my stay. I had the pool view which was not a pretty sight at all, but I had planned to keep the shutters closed anyway, so this was not an issue. If you're looking for a place to rest on a budget that includes free amenities near the airport, I would recommend this hotel. Also, the free continental breakfast was actually really nice!

It would be nice if they could add a sitting area down by the bay area, though. The room was adequately clean and the bed was very comfortable.

Unfortunately our stay was ruined by two poor policy decisions by the hotel management.  On check-in, I made it clear I was using a debit card and was assured that no deductions would be made during \"pre-authorization\". This was untrue as $100 was immediately deducted and after we spent more than the $100 on a meal, not only was another $100 deducted but also the cost of the meal as well.  We now had over $300 not available on our debit card. We are assured it will be returned - in 5 days.  So my advice - do not use a debit card in this hotel even when you're told it will be OK.  The second is the Free WiFi fine print. The hotel advertises that free wifi is available. They don't tell you that it is NOT available free to Expedia bookings!! Expedia clients get one hour free wifi - only in the lounge, only for one device per room and only once per stay - seriously.  Free wifi is only available to loyalty program members, corporate clients and people who book directly thru the hotel website.  None of this is made clear anywhere until arrival. Free WiFi should be available in all hotels and for this hotel to gouge its Expedia clients in this way is unforgivable.  If you get caught like we did, persist with your request for free wifi and the staff will eventually provide an access code! Also allow an hour to checkout! Apart from these very sour notes, it was a very pleasant stay.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"The ambience and decor is incredible","negativeRemarks":"Poor staff training leading to misleading info at checkin about debit card use.

The Grand Atrium is like something out of a movie and will make you very happy - you can enjoy tea and cocktails and listen to music in the evening.

The pool is great for kids and adults - there's a dome over it so you feel like you're still part of the city.  My daughter loved the Ghirardelli shop that is accessible through the hotel, the concierge was very helpful, and the food was delicious - free coffee until 10 in the lobby was a bonus. In that area, recommend Bodin one block over for breakfast, and The Grove down a block and around the corner - so yummy. The Asian Art Museum down Market Street was a gem, and almost all the buses run down Market Street in front of the hotel so you can get to the Legion of Honor (awesome!) and to Golden Gate Park (Tea Garden and Science Museum were terrific).  Easiest to get a Clipper card at Walgreens - can use it for the cable cars ($7 each) and the bus ($2 something).

A person named Easton was very helpful and had a suitable room for me, but he seemed unable to get it cleaned for hours.  I was finally moved into the room at 230pm.   A full day had passed.  Easton assured me that he would make it up to me.  I never heard anything from him.

I was completely disgusted, went back to my room and called the front desk to alert them of the issue.  They said they would promptly take care of it and thanked me for calling. 2 hours later we went back up to use the pool facilities again to find the broken glass still there, as well as multiple empty glass bottles strewn around the area.  Disgusted we went back to our room changed for dinner and headed down to talk to the manager. She apologized profusely and explained they were in transition of a staff switch over but admitted that was no excuse. She sent us up some champagne and gave us late check out, but this doesn't fix the amount of neglect on their part and unsafe conditions they left the pool in for hours.

Don't think I've ever stayed in a hotel room that didn't have a closet.  The bathroom had sufficient electrical outlets but the only outlets available in the sleeping area were lodged up under the desk and you had to crawl underneath on your hands and knees to get to them.  The connection between the shower head and water pipe appeared to be stripped and the shower head just hung there loosely and could not be adjusted.  I understand the laws of supply and demand but paying the price we had to pay for this room was unacceptable and just morally wrong.

When we returned to our room that evening, after a day of sight seeing, Rueben had sent up a lovely bottle of chilled champagne, cheese, crackers, fruit and chocolate covered strawberries!  He also left a Happy Birthday message on the phone for my daughter.  It is this hospitality and attention to detail that make staying at the Palace so unique and special.  There are many hotels in the City of San Francisco, and I have stayed at many as our company has an office in the City and I have to travel there frequently.

We came in on the BART from the Airport and it was really easy to get to. It's also really easy to make your way to many parts of the city as it's so central. The hotel building itself has a lovely reception/ open area when you arrive. The rooms were clean and the bathrooms likewise.\r\n\r\nCon's - The walls between the room are quite thin and each morning I woke up with either the noise of people talking when walking by or from the room next door. We got the towncar at (8:30pm and no traffic), our journey was less than a mile and it was $20 which we both thought was expensive, though the door man advised us afterwards this was standard. The room itself was not the largest room I've stayed in but it was fine for what we needed, though the pillows were superhigh and definitely higher and more uncomfortable than anything I've come across in a hotel before. \r\n\r\nWe didn't have breakfast in the hotel as other reviews had turned us off, however, the room did look beautiful.\r\n\r\nOverall, it was fine for the 3 nights we were there, we both agreed we wouldn't be staying there on our next visit though as we felt there are better hotels available for the money we paid.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"H","userLocation":"Orange County","reviewSubmissionTime":"2014-07-14T20:14:13Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"27274","reviewId":"10000146991","photos":[],"itinId":"178230979438","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Nice hotel & stay, but check-in issue","reviewText":"Very beautiful hotel in nice location, and overall a nice stay. However, had an issue with front desk clerk not allowing the other adult occupant to check-in until I showed up with my ID, which forced the family to be sitting in the lobby for an hour because I had to drop them off. I specifically put that request in the reservation with the other person's name. The front desk would not allow her to check in until I got there, despite even showing a hard copy of the Expedia confirmation. The clerk told her it must not have come across on the reservation and he could not use the hard copy. When I got there and spoke to a different clerk, I was told it was in the reservation. \r\n\r\nSo I don't know if it is an issue with Expedia reservations, or if it is an incompetent front desk clerk...probably a poor clerk, since when I asked him what kind of view the room had, he told me it was a view of the \"courtyard\", which turned out to be a roof with some gravel and a vent several stories below, with windows of other rooms across the \"courtyard\" just a few yards away.

Also, I was annoyed by the internet pricing philosophy, which requires a rather high daily charge for basic access. This results in many guests camping out in the lobby and common areas taking advantage of the free internet in those areas. Management needs to rethink this since the extra few dollars they gather dwarfs the ill will generated by the guests (such as myself) that feel nickeled and dimed to death by this place and the poor atmosphere created by disgruntled internet nomads in the lobby.

We utilized CityPass which includes unlimited Muni bus/streetcar/subway/cable car usage, along with a couple cab rides, and came out far ahead.\n\nA few small complaints. The rooms don't include a coffeemaker, but they'll bring you one to use upon request, subject to availability - for some reason they made a point of emphasizing \"we only have a few\" and that we received the last one. Weird. The default pillows are small and hard (foam-filled) but they'll bring you nice down pillows on request. Our first night's sleep was uncomfortable, then we figured this out. Our room 634 contained no listing of services, and our check-in clerk never mentioned the free coffee bar available downstairs in the morning. The Garden Court is gorgeous but breakfast (or brunch) is extremely expensive, save it for a special occasion. There's a Starbucks behind the hotel, and a McDonald's a half-block northeast on Market. Also 3 Walgreens (!) and the Westfield shopping mall within 2 blocks.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"pool","negativeRemarks":"pillows","locationRemarks":"ideal","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Seattle, WA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2012-11-24T20:49:28Z","roomTypeId":173998,"userDisplayName":"Bill","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Families","categoryLabel":"Families"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"4","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_ca","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"27274","reviewId":"40364531","photos":[],"itinId":"151727860662","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"4105","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Palace Hotel","reviewText":"Excellent hotel overall.

A nice enough indoor pool with skylight.\n\nCons: They charge extra (I think $15/day) for internet access in your room. I'm sure it does not cost them $15/day for each person who uses the Internet. Charging extra, as opposed to incorporating the cost in the room fees, just makes it seem like they are using it as a profit center, and are not trying to be customer oriented. They also don't have a gift or snack shop or vending machines (that I could find), so no Coke if you get thirsty. The rooms also lack a printed hotel-information guide. You can get information on your TV, but you have to wait for it to boot up, and then again while it pauses to \"access that information,\" once you figure out the TV system.

We didn't have much of a view, but that was okay; because we faced inward even though we were on the second floor there was no street noise. I was worried about being able to hear the conversations of the people next door based on some of the other reviews, but while we could hear people out in the hallway fairly clearly we didn't hear anything next door. The staff downstairs were really helpful too. Location was great, with a BART station and F-Car stop just outside the door.

The Grove, a local restaurant, was a very good selection for lunch.

This one is worth staying at.\nA few pros and cons:\nPros: Location, a few feet front the F trolley. Can walk or ride to the harbor. Architecture. High ceilings and nice sized rooms. Friendly staff, lots of help. Great bar and good food ( expensive of course ). Kid friendly, nice pool. Fresh fruit and coffee every day in the lobby and gym.\nCons: A little shabby in the room. Lamp shades frayed. We needed two rooms next to each other ( 3 daughters ). Needed to call again to make it happen--did not pay attention to request on Expedia. One room was not ready at 3pm, but not a problem we simply walked to the harbor.\nA few tips:\n1) You don't need a car; however, many cabs on fit 4. F train is $2 dollars / person and right next to hotel.\n2) Muir woods is worth the trip. Did an open bus trip to sausalito and muir woods. Great day.\n3) Book Alcatraz in advance and do the audio tour.\n4) Don't eat at Sinbads even though it looks ok and is the first restaurant if you walk.\n5) Do eat at Horizon's on the back deck in Sausalito.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Philadelphia Pa","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-07-08T00:22:44Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Tim","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Families","categoryLabel":"Families"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"21187","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"27274","reviewId":"17769116","photos":[],"itinId":"326211386","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Rosemary","brandType":"Expedia","title":"San Francisco Gem","reviewText":"The hotel was beautiful, clean and comfortable.

Breakfast in hotel was scrummy, bit pricey at $28 each, but did endulge on our last day, fabulous breakfast buffet.Concierge were exceptionally helpful, they made our 10 day trip very enjoyable 10/10 there.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Camberley","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-06-08T16:12:53Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"27274","reviewId":"17769339","photos":[],"itinId":"267296634","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Steven","brandType":"Expedia","title":"This Iconic San Francisco Hotel Really Delivers","reviewText":"This is my first stay at The Palace Hotel, San Francisco. I have been in the public rooms before, particularly the Garden Court (one of the most beautiful dining rooms on the planet, I believe) and the magical Maxfield's Pied Piper bar. The great transverse promenade features many historical artifacts from the Hotel's 100+ years. It is worth stopping to see them all. Our room was very clean and the two standard size beds were extra comfy! The bathroom was clean and \"full service\", as well. My only off-note is that the toilet tank had a very slight, very slow leak which caused a bit of a \"puddle\" on the bathroom floor. I reported it to the front desk and it was handled immediately! Overall, this hotel is a San Francisco Icon on every level. The location on Market Street next to the Montgomery Street BART/Muni station & \"F-Line\" stop (vintage street cars) is a huge plus. You can walk everywhere within the nearby Union Square, SOMA, Embarcadero areas. The hotel is very convenient. SFMOMA is right around the block! Stay here, if you get the chance.

There were so many incidences lacking customer service. First, the t.v. didn't work. We called 2x before \"the engineer\" came 2 hrs. later to tell us a plug needs to be wiggled. Second, we paid the internet fee (which we didn't mind). I called to ask if we could plug in another computer to the cable without paying another fee and was told yes. When we plugged in the other it said we had to pay another fee. $40. a night for internet is excessive. Next, the sink was plugged up to overflowing. I called to have them unplug it and told them that we had reservations to go to dinner. No one came. I went to the front desk upset about the lack of response and their reply was that the hotel was full. Someone came while we were at dinner and left wet towels on the floor. That night a sorry note with a coupon for a free breakfast was placed under our door. The next evening we called for a wine bottle-opener 2x within 2 hrs. and no one came. I finally went to the hotel bar where the bartender gave me the opener and two wine glasses to replace the plastic ones in room. 4 hours later someone knocked with the bottle-opener! The service was deplorable and unresponsive. The staff answering questions was uneducated about how things work in the rooms. It felt like we were staying at a $50. budget hotel.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":2,"ratingHotelCondition":1,"ratingService":1,"ratingRoomComfort":1,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"San Diego, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-06-03T16:20:48Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"27274","reviewId":"17768900","photos":[],"itinId":"276111366","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"A.","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Beautiful","reviewText":"Grand old hotel with convenient location - walkable to Ferry Bldg, Union Sq., Museum district (wear very comfortable shoes).","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"near San Francisco, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-06-03T14:25:49Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"27274","reviewId":"17769156","photos":[],"itinId":"275605796","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"mary","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great hotel at expedias great price with airfare","reviewText":"They should provide coffee all morning in the lobby instead of just a couple of hours.

We found it too expensive to eat at the hotel but there is an endless choice of places to eat throughout the city. If you want to stay in affordable luxury, The Palace Hotel is for you. The only complaint I have is that the staff were not very helpful about making telephone calls from the hotel. The advice we were given cost us dearly for making a toll free phone call. However the doorman let us use his phone for free.

The room was more than great with a large flat panel tv, a bed that somehow fit my soft bed preference and my boyfriends firm bed preference, and the bathroom feels nothing like the average hotel bathroom with lots of charm. Two plush robes in the armoire were a nice touch. The spa was also very nice, we went early morning and also at around 8:30 pm, neither time were there more than 4 people in the 3 lane lap pool. Everyone is so nice! The restaraunts are very expensive, although we did have room service which was top quality. You can find complimentary coffee and apples in both the lobby and spa in the mornings. The female concierge was wonderful taking her time to help each time I came to ask a question. As for the location, you are less than a 10 minute walk from everything, including the trolly to take you to Fisherman's wharf. If you want to take BART to the hotel from the SA airport, ask where the platform is and take a shuttle from there where you will ride to the \"yellow line\" and then take it to Montgomery St., then walk across the street and check-in!

Particularly on Friday evening street performers set up with a microphone directly outside the hotel on Market. The room and bathroom were both quite small -- this isn't surprising given the age of the hotel. Additionally, it's age makes it not the hotel for great views -- it only has 8 stories.

They provide you robes in your room which are quite comfortable to lounge around in and the beds were definitely nice. The pool wasn't as impressive as pictured but the fact that it's indoors is definitely a plus since it's cold in San Fran. I suggest checking out Lefty O'Douls Piano Bar near Union Square for cheap hearty food and a fun yet laid back atmosphere.

The room was elegant with plush, regal bedding.  The modern fixtures, full length mirrors and ammenities in the bathroom were a nice touch.  The hotel has a Day Spa to relax at, and fresh coffee in the lobby each morning.  The knowledgable concierge identified a some fantastic restaurants within walking distance or a short cab ride.  Great overall SF location!  And a price that didn't kill a Queen's budget.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Modesto, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2004-12-10T16:18:02Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]}]}}}

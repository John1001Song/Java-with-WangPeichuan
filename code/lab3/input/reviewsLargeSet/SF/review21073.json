No kids, peace and quiet. A hotel centrally located in the city. Bliss!\r\n\r\nNow add in the person in the room next to you. Smoking weed so heavily that there is a cloud coming under your shared door into your room. You get a proximity high from it. Awesome right?!\r\n\r\nNow how about loud music and rough, awful sex coming from that same room into the wee hours of the morning. Even better right?! After sex, she orders a pay per view movie and blasts it at full volume, passing out around 2 am from her evening activities, but TV is still blaring. Blissful. \r\n\r\nTwo phone calls to the front desk got the typical, \"Sure, we'll look into it\" and then no response after that. Blissful.\r\n\r\nI even gave the manager an opportunity to refund a night's stay to make up for the nonsense and he responds with \"How about I write off your 2 drinks you had at our hotel bar\". What a joke. \r\n\r\nNow a little about me- I'm a 32 year old who stays out late, parties with his wife and friends-- I'm the last person who would complain about something, but this was absolutely atrocious. And with the response they gave me, it was clear they don't really care to change anything about that type of activity in their hotel. Certainly their perogative, but I'll surely never return to there or any of their other locations, and will do everything in my power to make sure no one else I know does either. \r\n\r\nRespectfully yours (not this hotels), \r\n\r\nDon\r\n\r\n","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":1,"ratingHotelCondition":1,"ratingService":1,"ratingRoomComfort":1,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"M","userLocation":"Richmond, VA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-09-12T13:21:31Z","roomTypeId":200722342,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":true,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"3","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_gb","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"21073","reviewId":"57d68f21dc99570b537ca41b","photos":[],"itinId":"112780196976","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[{"isFlaggable":true,"userNickname":"Hotel Manager","displayLocale":"en_us","date":"2016-09-25T19:45:14Z","id":"ffb946c5-e4d6-4c9c-a4e8-33c97faeb35d","response":"Thank you for your five star review!

Maybe I am old fashioned-I actually like a dresser to put my clothes into instead of plastic bins in the closet. The room was good sized w/ a large desk, with a phone that could only be used on speaker. If you tried to switch it off of the speaker option it disconnected your call. The phone by my bed wouldn't give me a dial tone. The bathroom, though nicely tiled, had no counter space & no drawers to put toiletries & make up. My daughter was staying w/ me, so doubly challenging. The shower head for the shower was loose, you couldn't adjust it past the one direction it was hanging & when shutting off the hot water faucet after your shower, it almost burned your hand. I liked the fact that you could opt out of room service for a $15 credit in the bar or restaurant for each day you are there. This is offered if you stayed 2 or more days. Opt in! My biggest annoyance, though, was the $25 per day facility fee that was tacked on when I checked out!  Upon check-in I was given a small card outlining what I thought was an option for Wi-Fi, exercise room etc. To be fair, I didn't inquire further & decided that I would use my own hub for wi-fi, if needed. I became aware of it on checkout. When I questioned it, I was told some hotels were now charging this add on fee. When questioned further the receptionist admitted she was referring to her chain of hotels.

When we returned, the smell was replaced by something more pleasant but the odor returned after a few hours. We decided to just avoid that space since we only needed to pass it when entering or exiting the room. A lot of the room fixtures are in disrepair and the bathroom was oddly shaky as well. Cleanliness was not a strongpoint as dirt was visibly accumulated on the door hinges and when I went to rest for the evening and looked at the ceiling, there was a huge clump of dust around one of the ceiling fixture covers. I just prayed that it would not fall on my while I slept.

Hard to Find","reviewText":"We don't go to San Francisco very often. Finding our hotel has been the number one thing to cause anxiety every time we go. This hotel is not marked well on the outside, just a small gold plaque that says the Clift on the wall in between 2 sets of huge glass doors. We drove around the block twice to find it. Then there was no way to park to check in, except to double park. We had to jump out in traffic and hand over the keys parked half in a traffic lane. \r\n \r\nGetting our car back after check out was a little frustrating. They told us 15 to 20 minutes, and we kept checking out front to see if the car was there. There were empty parking spaces in front, no cars, so we kept waiting. Fourty-five minutes later, I actually asked about our car, and it was parked halfway down the block, not within site of the front of the Clift, and probably had been for a while. Would have been nice if the valet service announced that \"guest\" car is available\r\n. \r\nThe hotel itself is beautiful. All the staff was polite and helpful. The room was clean and pretty. It had a room service/honor bar style fridge that was too warm, but we managed to squeak in our own snacks, and get ice from room service to replenish our cooler.  No in room coffee pot or microwave. The room service food was delicious, the servers were very nice. I am never quite prepared for the cost of such things, but at least the food and people didn't make me regret the luxury. \r\n","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"I like the staff.

No one is watching your stuff, so you better! 4) The manager told us our room had been given away to the guest who stayed the evening before (who did not have a reservation) & we were being sent to another hotel. Never should a person without a reservation be given priority over a person with a reservation. That is just bad business and RUDE. We planned 2 nights at the Clift because we wanted to try a new hotel and because we did want to pack up and transfer hotels. Their bad business decision ruined our mini-vacation to the city and they thought they could make up for it by sending us to another hotel at their expense and upgrading us to a suite on night 2 when we had to return to their hotel. Honestly, the Clift is nothing special and we would have rather of stayed 2 nights at the hotel they sent us to when the Clift turned us away. Hotel Nikko is incredible.

The only fault of the CLIFT was the designer's choice in fabrics and materials. As pretty as it all looks, it's just NOT durable for a commercial use. Our bathroom was completely fitted with white tiles and white grout... and we all know how hard it is to keep white tile grouts looking clean!

It's true the rooms are small, but efficiently laid out and the lobby is so comfortable that you just want to hang out there. We went down to the lobby for drinks or desert every single night we were there. The hotel sort of naturally encourages you to get out of your room and socialize, perhaps what was intended with old school hotels. And really, when you are visiting a city, do you want to sit in your room?\n\nExtras were expensive, so we didn't get room service, or internet, and the base price seemed high to me. But ther service was impecable and they get an extra point from me for their respectful restoration of the property. Add to that the incredible Redwood Room, pannelled a hundred years ago from the boards of just one tree, the gorgeous lobby, and the great location, and for once, my hotel started to actually add a lot to my trip.

It was my husbands bday and I wanted to take him out for a nice dinner and the night before the concierge told us to go to scalla's, which is not a nice place. Andrea suggested 25 luxe and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal and the bar she suggested we go to afterwards. Oh and there are a lot of prostitutes hanging outside at night, looking for business.

If you can find the same rate at a place near Market St, might be a better choice. For example, there is no business traveler oriented breakfast service included in the rate. This is like the W with improved style and ambiance but fewer amenities.\n\nService was generally excellent, except for cocktail service in the Living Room (the lobby annex of the hotel bar, which itself is really more of a nightclub). Here, I often had to go hunt down the cocktail waitress. Once I ordered my first round, service was generally good thereafter. Same scenario on three trips though, so I take it this is their standard of service for greeting and taking your initial order. Snacks at the bar are very good though pricey.

Our experience at the Clift Hotel was outstanding. We spent 5 nights in Standard King room which is compact; we adjusted and would stay in that size room again. A couple traveling with 3-4 large pieces of luggage should consider a larger room. The room and the hotel common areas, restaurant, restrooms...every area impecably clean! The bed was so comfortable that we had a great sleep the first night! Every hotel employee was friendly, helpful, courteous and made sure that our needs were met. The food in the restaurant was excellent; one morning I had steak and eggs and the steak was so flavorful and melted in my mouth. The house-baked granola was outstanding and the coffee was better than any that I can get at Starbucks. It's about a 10 minute downhill walk to Muscone Convention Center. About 4 minute walk to Union Square. Lot's of good places to eat outside of the hotel. Try Cafe Mason (one minute walk# for excellent service, food and fair pricing. Room service is 24 hours but hotmeals stop around 1:00 AM #?) and start again at 5:00 AM. Regarding electronics we were traveling with 2 iPads, 2 cell phones, a separate digital camera and a piece of medical equipment. I'm glad that I brought two extension cords and a powerstrip with me.

Unfortunately the view out of the window is not very pleasing - just buildings. The other thing to be wary of is the thinness of the walls - I could hear the couple in the room next to me talking amongst other things. It was quite loud. I don't know if this is because I was given a room with an interconnecting door which was locked. I was three for three nights so that was a bit of a shame. The other issue to be aware of is the charge of calls - a call that didn't connect was charged at $22 and I made 4 attempts and was charged this amount 4 times! They were good about deleting the items from the bill. Also their hotel car though being told it was $75 to the airport was $100 by the time I added tax and gratituties. Difficult when you come from Australia. It would be nice to be given access to vouchers etc. None of these were available or if they were were not offered to me. I think it's more of an \"exclusive\" hotel - not the sort of place for families I'm afraid and if you turn left out of the hotel you end up in an area of town you would rather not be.

Staying in the city we expected more city noise, but with the modern windows (which did open for fresh air) and polite taxi drivers, we experienced peaceful slumber.\n\nThe bath room in our room was small but adequate. Nothing luxurious, but it served its purpose, was clean, and the shower was hot.

In short, the hotel casts itself as a tastemaker, wants its guest to be consumers of products it identifies, and profits from their sale, rather than concentrate on serving the guest and meeting guest needs.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Cocnut Grove, Fl.","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-06-24T12:06:48Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"4","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_ca","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"21073","reviewId":"18019512","photos":[],"itinId":"277894018","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"4105","userNickname":"Narch","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great service","reviewText":"The hotel staff could not be more helpful.

The deep, warm redwood motif of the lobby level is breath-taking and magical. The artistry of the grand lobby flows quietly into its interpretation in the intimate space of the adjoining \"Library,\" into the classic grandeur of the dining room, and into the inviting restrained elegance of the bar where a lively scene every night provides entertainment even for those who prefer to watch the comings and goings of youthful party people from the quiet comfort of the library or the cozy surrounds of the giant fireplace. The upper floors are light and airy as the ground floors are dark and intimate. When the elevator opens, one is immersed in soft, pale lilac-greys, pearl, and silver--as if emerging through the redwood forest valleys into the tree top fogs of the Bay area. The chef is top notch! Service in all areas the most professional and warm. All is perfect as long as those doormen keep opening the huge entry doors, which are much too heavy for the guest who does not work out daily...--perhaps the doors suggest entry into an enormous castle in the middle of a very old magic forest....but everything is high tech, friendly, and warm the minute you cross the threshold.

We could not have found a better place! Were totally satisfied. I must say we did not even want to go anywhere else and spent most of the evenings there... Thanks to the Redroom... Clift is known for its very well designed lobby and the Redroom. A stunning, elegant lounge with beautiful digital paintings, an enormous bar, and chic redwood paneling and a nice crowd.... The Redwood Room is one of the most luxurious night spots in San Francisco. Get quite crowded in the evening. Great place, nice crowd, we loved it ! See many people are saying the staff was rude, was not the case with us. Everybody was friendly and very helpful... So if you are single and looking for the hotel with the nice bar to hang out in the evening ( together with the good locations, service etc ), this is the place to be. I would not dare to recommend it for the families with the kids though. Depends on what you are looking for. We were extemely happy and satisfied... And have a had a great weekend.

What we couldn't figure out was why the room had a bose ipod dock, but the tv was an 18 in. screen that you could barely see from the bed. The prices for the \"extras\" were ridiculous. You would think that in an expensive hotel they would be more generous with their guests. The weight room was decent, but not \"state of the art\" as they called it. The biggest draw back was the service at the hotel. The cleaning people were the friendliest out of all of the staff at the hotel. At the front desk, when we came in early to see if we could get in early, the first two people were very unhelpful. The third finally helped us, but that was 6 hours later. One night when we came in late, people were lined up for the bar/club and the doorman was extremely rude as he demanded our room keys before we could go up to our rooms. Mostly the staff acted like they would only really like you if you looked trendy and rich. I would say about 50% of the staff was helpful.

Note, the restaurant looks super, but both the bar and the restaurant are VERY expensive, even for SF standards. However, given the quality and ambiance of the digs, I can see why.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"New York","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-12-12T05:23:52Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Paul","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"21073","reviewId":"18019724","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Beth","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Not super excited but I enjoyed.","reviewText":"I enjoyed how comfortable the bed is, it was perfect and very big.

My room was lovely, with the biggest bed i've ever seen, with two giant ceiling to floor mirror, and a stylish all be it cozy bathroom. Everything was clean and tidy. The CD alarm clock came in useful and so did the air-con. Was very pleased to find a safe in my room as well as an ironing board, iron and hair-dryer. As the hotel has a swanky restaurant attached i pleasently suprised by the hotel roomservice, which offered some great food, and there's a priority service for guests if they want to eat in the restaurant itself. The staff were very helpful doing wat you'd expect of the opening doors cleaning rooms etc. But the comlimentary nightly turndown service was fantastic to come back to of an evening, making your room feel invitinng and helping you get ready for bed. Some things I did find slightly annoying were that the walls did at times seem a little thin and the tabtop curtains let a lot of light in as they don't completely close. They let in a line of light where they meet, the blind was also hard to use. Other than that it was an amazing trip and an incredible hotel.

The shower had great water pressure. The robes were great too. The staff was very friendly. The concierge was great at facilitating our tours. The housekeeping was fast, we requested a bucket of ice each day for drinks we bought at the walgreens (right across the street). The hotels restaurant, ASIA DE CUBA is MUST! its expensive, but very large portions are served and the food was DELICIOUS! Its a Cuban/Asian styled menu; We are of Cuban descent and I can tell you the food was excellent! We had 2 entrees, 2 cocktails and an appetizer for about $70.00 each. We had plenty of left overs and the next day, housekeeping gave us a microwave so we could heat up our food at no charge!!! The doormen were also very friendly and knowledgeable about where to go for dinner/breakfast etc. Redwood Room is a HOT SPOT, great drinks and atmosphere. Note: all nightlife closes at 2am! Beware of many beggars on the streets, we found that they're harmless though. We will definitely come back to THE CLIFT! Totally worth the money! If you have time, visit the ACT Theatre (right down the stree) and see what shows you can catch.

It's dimly lit, moody, and the lobby is punctuated with eclectic furnishings. The room was smaller than we were accustomed to, but seeing as everything is on top of everything else in San Francisco, it was to be expected. It's not uncomfortably small, but don't be surprised if it's smaller than rooms in other cities. All of the hotels rooms are small in the city. The room was well decorated with several mirrors and a huge bed with fabulous sheets and pillows. We slept extremely well every night. Some other reviews have mentioned a noise issue in the rooms.

I loved the giant, oversized chair/art in the lobby, the lavender walls in the hallways and rooms, the purple, red & green lighted elevators and dark, dramatic alcoves where you could relax with a cocktail after work or sightseeing.

The location is great, 24 hour parking around the corner and a short walk to Union Square. The front lobby is lively in the evenings but the hustle and bustle is left behind once you reach the elevators. Once you reach your floor, if you encounter any of the housekeeping staff they're friendly, but maybe that's because I'm asian. My room was clean, lots of fresh towels and amenities, and the sheets were amazing. The only issue I had was the lack of privacy, the walls are not paper thin, but the doors between the rooms and out into the hall tend to be an inch or more off the ground. A family was next door and I ended up stuffing the bottom of the door with a towel. My particular room had thick curtains you could draw to diminish hallway and bathroom noise. The windows, although in need of a bit of cleaning (I can't imagine they would clean it every day being 15 floors up) Opened up to an amazing view at night. All in all it was amazing for a one time stay, if I were to look for the same level of accomodation the next time I stay, I think I might be able to find better for the same amount of money.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Seattle, WA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2006-03-20T03:55:56Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"21073","reviewId":"18019526","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Mike","brandType":"Expedia","title":"A Very Hip Hotel","reviewText":"The Clift will appeal to a particular type of traveler.

The first issue was very minor. I asked the bell hop for directions and he told me to take a right when I should have gone left. Luckily, I knew my way enough that it wasn't an issue. The second issue was with the concierge. She wasn't a pleasant person in general and wasn't very good at her job. I attempted to book three reservations through the concierge. The first restaurant she sent us was a tourist trap (may have well sent me to the Rainforest Cafe). The second place had terrible reviews on Yelp so we did not honor the reservation. Finally, she botched the last reservation we asked her to make. After taking about a $60 cab ride to Cliff House we discovered she had booked us for the main restaurant and not for the brunch. When talking to her we were very specific we wanted the brunch. \r\n\r\nIn summary... This hotel is fantastic, but my recommendation is to just use Yelp or plan your own way.

They have a push button service (literally in the room there is a button to press) to receive anything you want. They charge $12.95 per day for the Internet in the room, but you could use the business center or the lobby for free wireless service; you could also go to a few places nearby (Starbucks cafe and a few other cafes that provide free WiFi. We used Hertz for car rental on specific days. Booked the previous day through the concierge. They bring the car to the hotel and you may return the car by the end of the day (up to 10pm) at a Hertz location just one block from the hotel. You may avoid the car parking/garage charges of $40-55 per day/night in the area hotels. Hertz charges are reasonable - e.g., $40-60 per day depending on the size of car you want with GPS/NeverLost system. Very convenient!\n\nJW Marriott has a great restaurant - $18 for buffet or a la carte breakfast. A full bar with a great ambience. The elevators have glass outer so you can see the hotel rooms and the lobby - somewhat like the Embassy Suites.\n\nRecommend Kokkari Restaurant - the best Greek restaurant in the US, which is just a couple of miles from the hotel; walking distance.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"St. Louis, MO","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-07-14T16:59:53Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Ram","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"2063","reviewId":"20275401","photos":[],"itinId":"322072140","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"John","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Nice Hotel - would stay there again","reviewText":"Spent 7 days in early June.

The entire hotel has been redone so the rooms are all very modern and contemporary. The bed was heavenly! A few weird things.. Dont be fooled by the fancy ice bucket, you wont actually use it. There are no public ice machines located in the hotel, therefore you must flip your magic switch in order to have an attendant bring you ice. Also, the fridge like in many hotels is on a timer, dont dare touch anything in it or you will be charged after 15 seconds, I was however very pleased to find out they had extra refrigerators available for no additional cost. Just have them bring your fridge and ice at the same time! The bathrooms were very nice and all marble. Concierge was very helpful. I would say the only drawback would be the fact that there is no complimentary Wifi. We also had a problem with a somewhat expensive item we left behind in the room but the hotel claims to never have found.

The staff apologized and did not charge us...no negotiations necessary...very nice experience. The staff was very helpful and courteous. I never got the impression that they were waiting for a tip..in fact they almost seemed surprised at tips for normal activities such as hailing cabs.

The hotel put out very good hot apple cider and tangerines in the lobby in the late afternoon-evening. We never tried their restaurants because there were so many good ones in SF. We were on the 20th floor of a 21 floor hotel, with somewhat of a panoramic view of the city. The room and hotel were quiet, which made for a very good night's rest.

The fit menu at the 3rd floor Pacific Restaurant on premiuses provides outstanding breakfast and lunch dietary options. The only minor objection there is the frayed look of the restaurant. Window dressing is tired and looks out to adjacent buildings through dirty windows with little relief. Perhaps Marriott's infusion of cash will tackle the restuarant appearance first thing.

The maid service is the best I have ever seen, the same goes for the doormen and bellman.  The front desk and concierge staff ranged from helpful to too full of themselves to be bothered. It seemed to depend upon who was on duty.  We found it rather strange that in a suite that the refrigerator was mounted on a furniture cart that looked as if it had just come from a thrift store.  The bar and hotel dining are excellent. room service was slow and a special request to have champaign waiting in the room was ignored.  This is an excellent hotel and well worth a visit, but, the service  is not what it is claimed to be. Still, it is an excellent value .  The Beds are incredibly good.   It can be a bit noisy at the lower levels but not bad for a city hotel.

The room was small but comfortable -- vaguely Asian in style and a bit dated; a bit too 80s for my personal taste (especially the bathroom!) but well maintained. The hotel itself is built around an atrium, which makes the public areas somewhat noisy. \n\nAn odd quirk: There are no ice machines, so if you want ice, you have to have an employee get it for you. I presume that this is the result of wanting to pamper guests, but personally I resented having to tip (and wait!) for a service that I was perfectly happy to do myself. \n\nGood location, just far enough from Union Square to be \"off the beaten path\" but close enough so it's not a long haul to get there.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Seattle, WA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2004-11-30T19:30:25Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Anita","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"2063","reviewId":"20275422","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":1,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Lee","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Disatisfied Travler","reviewText":"My Husband left his wedding ring in the hotel, one morning and when we returned from a day of shopping it was no where to be found.

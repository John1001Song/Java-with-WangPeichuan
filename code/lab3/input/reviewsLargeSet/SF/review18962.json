The staff stood outside our room and talked and smoked, so we couldn't open the window. We could hear everything in the room above us. When we returned to the hotel after a day of sightseeing, the bed was made, but the bedspread was jammed on top of the TV cabinet, the staff did not clean out the coffee pot, nor replenish the coffee, cups and stirrer packets. We only got two chintzy towels. The worst thing was that you had to run the water for at least 5 minutes before it got hot. What a waste, especially during a drought! The tub floor was sticky and had hair stuck to it. The \" continental breakfast\" was packaged pastries and toast. The TV reception was spotty.

Standard room size with a large, clean bathroom. Conveniently located across the street from the zoo and a couple of short blocks to the ocean and beach, and fairly close to the SFSU campus. Other than those rooms that look out over the street, the rest of the rooms had no scenic vistas whatsoever—my view was the wall of the building next door. Appeared to be the best motel in the immediate area, but it's still definitely a budget motel. Housekeeping and desk staff were friendly, though I never made any special requests and just saw them in the mornings. Offers a simple free breakfast of English muffins, toast, apples, oranges, juice, and coffee. Neighborhood seemed safe and family-friendly. A bus stop is across the street and a MUNI tram system stop around the corner about a block, so it was very easy to get into town. Not knowing the public transit system, I took a Super Shuttle van from the airport ($17), but returning home, I took the MUNI into town ($2) and picked up the BART train ($8) to the airport. Quiet at night, though there was some minor construction noise next door during the day. Dining options are extremely limited—a small local cafe with bar and a local pizzeria are in the block, but didn't appeal to me, so I ended up buying stuff from a mom and pop grocery next door.

I usually don't leave reviews but this hotel stay was the worst.  This is a highly priced hotel, obviously your expectations are a little high.  Pillows are so terrible.  Even two pillow will make you feel like you are laying on the floor.  The bed it self is so old.  When you turn you can actually hear the springs.  This is just the start.  We finally managed to sleep around 1:00 AM.  At 2:30 AM Fire Alarm went off.  The whole seventh floor was suppose to be evacuated but not a single staff member were to be found on seventh floor.  When all of us managed to make it downstairs to Main lobby, No one knew what was going on except one person at front desk.  We waited in the lobby for almost an hour just to find out that it was false alarm.  If this is a high class hotel, then what is security doing?  Some one pulled the fire alarm and ran with out the security catching them?  After all of that drama, right at 9:00 AM, room cleaning staff kept knocking on my door.  Even though the check out time is not until 12 noon.  She knocked for good 3 minutes until I finally woke and managed to open the door and tell her that we are not checking out until 12 noon.  Did not sleep that night.

And in some ways, it does so but falls down on the details.  For such an expensive hotel, they need to get the basics right.  First, we had a \"premium\" queen room.  I fail to see what was premium about it.  The bed was clearly smaller than a Queen and snug for two people.  The bathroom lacked flash and was just ok (old school bathtub with shower curtain and small).  No private toilet here so be ready to be intimate with your roommate.  Small details like electrical plates broken or not attached (cheap and ugly) were not attended to.  The room was small and our view was the wall of the building next door.  The television service was scant featuring some 15 channels.  Not much to brag about.\r\nOn the bright side, the staff was friendly.  Happy hour complimentary wine was served downstairs each evening and coffee in the morning.  Not a bad place, but not up to the standard of a modern cool hotel.

I had to leave the suit cases out all week because there is zero room in the closet. Drawer storage was equivalent to two night stand drawers. The bathroom itself was tiny and needs to be redone. Overall it was mainly just worn. \r\n\r\nWhile the hotel in conveniently located just two blocks from Union Sqare, it's a rough two blocks. We made sure that we were back inside before dark each night. Even during the day the walk is dirty and smells strongly of urine. In addition you will encounter many homeless individuals asking for money about every 20 feet. \r\n\r\nThe hotel staff was friendly. We never asked for much to really rate their quality. The $30 amenity fee was a joke. Really you are paying $30 for wireless access and flavored water in the lobby. There is a restaurant and bar attached to the hotel, but it was open limited hours. The drinks that we had from there were fine, but we didn't feel that the menu had many options. The Walgreens across the street was the closest thing that we had to room service. \r\n\r\nI would not recommend this hotel for people with children, or anyone not completely accustom to city life.

It was a classy place that is less than a 8 min walk to Union Square, and is very close to transportation as well! \r\n\r\nLocation: The location is convenient in other ways, too--right across the street is a Walgreens if you forgot anything (although the staff can provide most toiletries), or if you get sick from the chilly SF weather, or if you just want some cheaper snacks. Great restaurants are nearby as well, and I have to say that the restaurant downstairs is quite nice too.\r\n\r\nStaff/Service: Really friendly and helpful staff--they got us hooked up with some tours (that usually meet up in Union Square, which is close). \r\n\r\nRoom: Decor was classy but unique!

During check in, we were told that the second room that we had reserved was not ready. Mind you this was 430pm and earliest check ins were at 3pm. Elias apologizes from the inconvenience and called housekeeping to get the room ready while we wait in the next room that was ready and assured us that someone will bring us the key pads once the room was ready. So, we went up to one of the room to unpack. When arriving at our room, it looked clean and nicely staged (just like on their website). As my daughters began to unpack, they noticed lipstick or blood stains on the bed sheets. This caused us to really take a closer look at both the two rooms. What we found were stains on three bedding sets, two pillow cases, and four comforters. We had house keeping changed out everything three times before we could get clean ones. I went down to front desk and expressed my disappointment with the cleanliness and the shift supervisor made apologies but couldn't do anything except wait to talk to his hotel manager who won't be in until the next day.

There were also many shops and restaurants on Geary.  The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.  Gave us restaurant recommendations when asked.

Same with the elevators and hotel space overall. For almost $400 per night, I have higher expectations. However the huge disappointment was there was no room service and they took the coffee makers out of the rooms. They overhauled the previous restaurant and replaced it with a menu that was underwhelming to say the least. As a business traveler, this was a big negative. They gave me a list of restaurants that deliver but the ordering process so complicated I punted. I went to the grocery store across the street to buy a sandwich, but didn't as they looked expired. I eventually caved at ate the restaurant, hoping for the best but was again disappointed. The server was AMAZING, but the place loud, food sub par and very expensive. lastly the cost to valet park your car overnight was over $50, yowzah.  I highly doubt I'll be staying there again.

First of all there was hair on the water cup I wanted to use to get a drink when we first arrived in the room. Gross. The service at the hotel leaves something to be desired. I had to leave a message to order room service because no one would pick up. Then after waiting 25 minutes for a cab I decided to walk to the corner and hail my own, the valet yelled at me because there were other people waiting in line. It looked to me as though they were all able bodied individuals who could hail their own cabs at anytime if they wanted instead of wait for an incompetent person to do it for them. When we tried to eat in the hotel restaurant we stood around for about 20 minutes and none of the staff even acknowledged us, let alone asked if we would like to be seated so we left and ate somewhere else. Also the hotel is in the ghetto. Be prepared to have homeless people asking you for change every time you step outside. I was very underwhelmed and won't be staying at Kimpton hotels again. Seriously, the Motel 6 would have been just as good.

We were the first guests, as the hotel just opened and were so impressed with the decor, the prices and the unique-ness of it. Because it was new, we figured tthe superior service and cleanliness of the hotel was due to it's youth! Not so!\n\nWe've stayed at Kimptons around the US, the San Francisco location is our favourite. (the damage from the 2005 hurricane caused the New Orleans location to close) We love the daily wine hour in the evenings with the free 15 minute massages and of course the pet friendliness of the hotel. We've never brought our dogs on vacation with us but there's something comforting and home-y about seeing people with their dogs checking in. And we always request the complimentary live goldfish in a bowl for our room during the stay. It may seem a goofy practice but it it's a fun addition.\n\nThe eclectic decor is probably my favourite. The Monaco has mastered mixing florals, stripes and animal prints and their art collection (by local artists) is quite impressive. When we got married, we decided to take our wedding photos at the hotel instead of at the wedding site because the hotel Monaco was so much more beautiful! The staff is awesome and very helpful.\n\nI could go on but suffice it to say that whenever we're traveling we see if there's a Kimpton Hotel in the city we're staying.

During our stay, they served complimentary wine from 4 PM to 6 PM, and complimentary coffee in the morning. There is a beautiful old-fashioned bar located inside the hotel.\n\nThe standard rooms are small (300-350 square feet), but average size for San Francisco. We had a queen size bed and a bathroom with a combination bathtub/shower. The view from our room was of a brick wall about 20 feet away. It would have been nice to have a view, but we still enjoyed our stay at Hotel Monaco.\n\nThere are many restaurants, bars, and stores within walking distance of the hotel. Parking is expensive in San Francisco, and driving usually takes longer than walking. There is a Walgreens across the street that is open until midnight. You can find many upscale stores at Union Square (about a 5 to 10 minute walk from the hotel). Chinatown is about another 5-10 minute walk past Union Square. Trolley cars run from Union Square to Fisherman's Wharf/Alcatraz for $5.00 per person. Complimentary maps of the neighborhood are available at the front desk.\n\nWhat I didn't like about San Francisco: 1) There are beggars on every street corner and they are not shy about asking you for money. Just keep walking. I would recommend taking cabs if you are out after midnight. 2) Idiots in Chinatown kept throwing firecrackers at me, but it was Chinese New Year (so maybe that won't happen to you).","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-03-10T16:03:13Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"15769","reviewId":"18412838","photos":[],"itinId":"307948045","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Ciara","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Good Choice","reviewText":"Great location near Union Square.

The first person we encountered when we stepped out of our taxi when arrived at our hotel was a homeless person, persistently begging us for money. This was not unusual and the area surrounding the hotel had several poor homeless people begging on every corner.

I have had great experiences with Hotel Monaco in other cities and it was a few blocks from where I need to be so thought I would give it a chance.\n\nThe first thing that struck me was the service of the hotel staff. They were all very friendly, extremely accommodating and really went out of their way to make me feel welcome. I have to admit the room was a bit smaller than I expected but it served my needs so I wasn't really bothered. There are potential charges for internet but if you join their loyalty program the internet is free. It was very reliable for my entire stay. The business center was great in that it had 4 computers and 2 printers. I was on limited time to eat and ordered room service and even though they had yet to move into their night menu they made an exception and were able to provide a quick meal to ensure I was ready for the evening. They also have morning coffee in the lobby and have a wine hour hosted by the staff every night.\n\nJust a few blocks away from Union Square there is a Walgreens across the street and a Starbucks one block away. We had to walk back to the hotel at 2:00 a.m. and the brightness of the area left me feeling safe throughout the 3 block walk back to the hotel.\n\nOverall, it was a great stay and I would definitely stay there again in the future.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Seattle, WA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-11-04T17:38:38Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"15769","reviewId":"18412531","photos":[],"itinId":"293260061","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Dan","brandType":"Expedia","title":"San Francisco Gem","reviewText":"Booked the Hotel based only on the information from Expedia.

At 3:30 a.m. it was 88 degrees in our room. When we advised the front desk the next morning they replied that we should have called them to advise of the problem. What would we have done at 3:30 a.m.? Best part about the hotel was the wine hour from 5:00-6:00 in the hotel living room. This was wonderful and a nice way to end your day.

We had a deluxe King room which was just beautiful. Incredible decor and very large. The bed was extremely comfortable. We did a world trip, travelling through Europe and then New York and San Francisco and the service in this hotel was the best we received anywhere. The bell man in particular was really outstanding. I've never experienced such genuine, friendly, helpful service. My only negative comments about the hotel would be that we had room 225 which was right next door to the function room on level 2. On 2nd morning we tried to have a bit of a sleep in but there was some setting up of the function room going on quite early and the clinking of the glasses and plates and cutlery was VERY loud. Also once the people got into the function room, they were extremely loud on their breaks and all milled around our room talking very loudly, so it was impossible to sleep in and very annoying. It wouldn't stop me from staying here again, I'd just request not to be in that particular room! The other negatives were, very dirty windows in our room and not being able to even pay for late checkout when we weren't leaving till 7pm for our late flight back to Australia. I guess this wasn't really their fault as they said they were overbooked on our room type. They also let me use the shower in the day spa downstairs which was actually a really nice shower!

The building is handsome and all of the public rooms (lobbies, restaurants, fireplace sitting room) are elegant and inviting. We booked a \"deluxe double\" and the beds and room interior were comfy and nice, but our room was quite small. Not so the bathroom, which was large and well-appointed with a mammoth, tiled walk-in shower. Nothing in S.F. is cheap, but breakfast in the main, very plush dining room was exhorbitant. With tip and limited dining choices our tab came to $88 for four. That's a lot for granola and waffles. They have what appears to be a very nice \"petite cafe\" with wood burning oven that looks good for light eats, though we didn't try. Parking is expensive, $50 a night, though we received a 25% reduction for having a hybrid. A goldfish in a bowl in our room (cute touch) was promised for our young daughter, and somehow it took nearly 1 1/2 days before it was delivered (the hotel has to understand the patience factor when it comes to pets and young kids). That, and too expensive breakfast, and smallish room were the negatives, but overall a very nice, shiny, elegant and well-located hotel.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"los angeles","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-09-09T18:06:36Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"4","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_ca","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"15769","reviewId":"18412700","photos":[],"itinId":"247365750","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"4105","userNickname":"Judy","brandType":"Expedia","title":"San Francisco's Best Hotel","reviewText":"Very easy to get to the hotel with BART.

We were delighted with all three hotels, the decor and service especially. The one slight disappointment was the size of the room, Although not cramped it wasn't as spacious as the rooms at Portland and Seattle but that might be down to the fact that space is at a premium in San Francisco. Unlike the other two hotels this one had a restaurant attached - The Grand Cafe. After walking the hills around San Francisco it was a joy to be able to dine in such close proximity to our bedroom. The staff were great. I asked at the desk whether I could have any shaving gel as mine had just run out. 30 minutes later the hotel receptionist knocked on my door to apologise for the delay and said that housekeeping had run out so he had been out to a shop to purchase a can.

They reserved us a table at one of the best restaurants in Napa Valley, Auberge Du Soleil. For never having been in San Francisco, they made the stay very enjoyable. The hotel itself is very well decorated and the Grand Cafe is great for breakfast, the food is very good. Highly recomended hotel!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Boca Raton, FL","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-03-28T21:54:49Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Brian","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"15769","reviewId":"18412686","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Karen","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great Hotel","reviewText":"The service was fantastic and the hotel is immaculate.\nGreat restaurant..","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"New York, NY","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-01-14T20:24:55Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"15769","reviewId":"18412767","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Angela","brandType":"Expedia","title":"San Francisco's Best!","reviewText":"This is not our first trip to Hotel Monaco.

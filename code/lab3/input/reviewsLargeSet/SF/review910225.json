The cons:  the room was small, almost cramped - this a place to sleep and shower, and little else;  it is located right on Lombard St, and traffic noise is noticable all day and night (we are used to that, and weren't particularly bothered by it, but light sleepers beware); 'free' parking spaces are minimal - they don't hide this fact, but we forego using the car as much as possible (thus we walked, ALOT) so that we wouldn't have to try to find street parking upon returning to a full hotel lot;  it seemed pricey, but, I don't believe moreso than other comperable hotels in the same area (most of which were booked anyway).  The pros: the staff was very friendly; the room was clean and updated; the hotel is fairly close to Golden Gate Bridge, Presidio, Fisherman's Wharf, etc - IF you don't mind putting a little mileage on your shoes (we didn't mind, so it worked out fine);  we found many good restaurants in the immediate area (all within 6-8 blocks, most much closer).

The overnight parking is free from 9 pm to 9 am in the nearby parking structure or street meters, but after 9 am meter per hour is about $4.75 (ridiculously high!).

Walk down Powell and you are at Union Square in a few minutes and the cable car terminus at Market Street in five to 10 minutes.

Nice hotel - friendly staff. In reading thru the materials they touted that they had a library of DVDs to check out at the main desk and we noticed that there was a DVD player in both the living room and the bedroom of our suite. So we checked out a movie and proceeded to try and figure out how you were supposed to switch the TV over from the cable signal to the DVD player. First I noticed on the back of the TV that DVD player wasn't even connected to the TV, so I connected it but still couldn't find an 'input' button on the TV or remote. We called the front desk, they had no clue and said a maintenance person would be right up to help us. We waited 45 minutes and noone ever came or called so I called the front desk again and was told \"Oh, I guess when we upgraded the TVs, the DVD players become unusable because they are incompatible with the TVs.\" Huh? Basically what happened was they threw away all of the remotes that came WITH the TVs and use the Comcast remotes that don't allow you to switch inputs. The hotel also proudly displays a \"Deep Sleep DVD\" on the desk to give you some soft music and sound effects to help you sleep... but... again... you can't play it.

For the price this place was amazing\nMy only complaint was that our 8th floor view was a bunch a buildings, not a bit of sky in sight. I know if I would have asked we could have been moved to a room with a better view.\nThe hotel was right on the trolly line and with in blocks of additional public transportaion, fine resturants, shopping and more.\nI can't wait to go back to San Fran and will stay again at the Orchard Hotel.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"St Paul, Minnesotat","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-04-17T13:22:03Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"564858","reviewId":"17729401","photos":[],"itinId":"359623267","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Dawn","brandType":"Expedia","title":"very impressed","reviewText":"My husband and I stayed here in the begining of\napril. the hotel was excellent! the service was also excellent!

A short walk down the hill brought you to many restaurants and a very large Westfield shopping mall.

A stroll 2 blocks down the road from the hotel is Chinatown. Some of the areas didn't look to nice for 2 ladies on their own but I was told it would be OK providing we were back before it got too late. If I had to get picky I could come up with three complaints. One would be the darkness of the room (very difficult to read because of the low lighting) 2. the coffee maker which only made one cup at a time. The cups are very large (and they only give you one tea bag, one regular coffee packet and one decafe coffee packet which for 2 people is definately NOT enough). so the one packet didn't give you more than a light coloring and no coffee flavor. (I did ask the maid for more but never got it.) 3. They have a computer in the lobby to check e-mails and print boarding passes. It's on a very high tabletop which at my 5'3\" made typing almost impossible as the keyboard was almost chin level!

The bed was very comfortable. Cons: The carpet was slightly \"damp\" over the entire room when we checked in. We weren't certain if it was from a carpet cleaning or a leak somewhere - but being that we checked in at 10:30 pm (late flight), we were too exhausted to switch rooms.

Even in remote areas I've had better hotels. If you have ANY need for Internet service, forget this place. Their service discinnects you about every 2 minutes, sometimes comes right back and sometimes wait an hour. I told the desk clerk, her answers were A. use a cable and B. its the most complained about thing and we keep telling the GM but he doesn't do anything. We arrived late, told desk for a 9:00AM wake up call. At 5:30AM they called! I came in at 3:30AM on check out day (I was in for biz and a big family wedding my last night) and asked for a 10:00AM wake-up. The bellman called at 8:00AM to tell me my car was here. I hadn't ordered a car! Oops, wrong room room was the reply. Room service a VERY limited menu from restaurant is way overpriced even by SF standards. Room info says from 3:00PM to 10:00PM. I called at 3:00PM to order a late lunch had to argue with the person who insisted room service started at 5:00PM. He finally agreed to ask and came back and said, yes it was 3:00PM and I could order. Another day I put out clean up room sign at 9:00AM. When I returned at 3:00PM it still wasn't made up. And it only gets worse, such as no in room movies, no HBO or other premium channels and more, but I'm running out of room. What tells it all about this hotel and its lack of conern is that the comment card requires the guest to put a stamp on it if you want to mail it. STAY AWAY! STAY AWAY!

We arrived fairly early with the hope they would allow us to check in early which they did. Valet parking was E40 plus taxes but this seemed more reasonable than paying E37 at the nearby garage as using the car was not necessary during our one night stay. The staff were most friendly, helpful and efficient. The room was comfortable, spacious and had all the features we needed: TV, free wifi, robes, toiletries, extra pillows, writing desk, lighting, (and didn't need - mini bar, safe, DVD player, CD player, wardrobes, vanity mirrors). We did not have a view as our room backed up onto another building but even that building had ornate architectural features so we it was not a total drawback. We did not eat at the hotel or frequent the bar but their availability was a plus. Also, a separate temperature control was in the room to either heat or cool and both worked well - I tested them to see if the worked but turned them off as they were not necessary during our stay. Checkout was also very efficient, with the porter collecting our bags and having our car retrieved.

There's a laptop in the lobby and we used it to book our Alcatraz tour (the staff let us print our e-tickets at no charge). We were glad to have our own laptop, though, as we were able to look up directions to various places on the MUNI (public transit) web site and read restaurant reviews. Only a couple of small negative points: you are right downtown so if you are a light sleeper you'll likely hear garbage trucks going by in the early morning if your room faces the back alleyway - it's not extremely loud but definitely audible. Also, the first night the fridge in our mini-bar made a high-pitched humming sound which was rather annoying but it seemed to go away after that, or else I simply got used to it.

Tunnel Top bar just east of the hotel is great! Bartenders are friendly and drinks are reasonably priced. Only Negative: After checkout, we commented to the conceierge we needed a cab to the airport. He rounded up their towncar and stated it would be the same price as a cab. Not true. We arrived by taxicab from the airport for $35 plus tip. At the airport the driver indicated the ride was $50 plus $3 airport fee, add in driver and conceirge gratuity and that equals $70!

It was advertised to be green, advocate for recycling, etc. Upon arrival, I saw no recycling bin in my room. I never saw one except one behind the front desk. I read the book about the hotel in the room and found that it was built in a green fashion. Great. But I never found the box that supposedly turned off my lights and turned down my heat when I left. I hung my towel up to indicate that I would reuse it again, and it was replaced. I have to say that it has been replaced at nearly every other hotel I have done this at too, so that is not a big surprise.

The hotel is on the Southeast corner of the intersection of Powell and Bush Street with the entrance about 70 yards east on Powell on Bush on the South Side of the street. To get to Union Square, you just walk out the door, to the left and down the hill on Powell for 2 blocks. On this very short walk, you encounter a Starbucks, a Seattle's Best (inside Borders), Sears Fine Foods, Michael Mina (fine dining inside the Westin), Lori's Diner, and many other food options. If you choose to make a right turn, you are greeted by the ChinaTown Gate on your left just a short block away. There is a Starbucks and Cafe De La Presse a very short distance down Bush Street as well. Noise level in the room was non-existant. Bed was very comfortable. TV/DVD player was inside a built in opposite the foot of the bed. Hotel DVD selection was actually very recent. The staff was eager to give maps, directions, public transit info, etc. No need for a car in SF, if you want an excursion, just book a rental car daily or just when you need it, almost all agencies have a deck in the Union Square Area. The only negative was the fact that when we arrived, both elevators were out of service and the staff seemed at a loss, as they did not even suggest we leave our bags with them and offer to bring them up later. So we got some excersize, not a bad thing after a long day of travel.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Birmingham, AL","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-07-09T13:29:39Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"4","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_ca","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"564858","reviewId":"17729131","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"4105","userNickname":"Gretta","brandType":"Expedia","title":"great hotel friendly staff","reviewText":"stayed at this hotel as a girls weekend. found the room was excellent very comfortable-beds and pillows were great. the staff was really friendly and accomadating. will definatly go back","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"calgary","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-07-08T14:50:59Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"564858","reviewId":"17729133","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Adam","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Superior SF Experience","reviewText":"Perfect place to stay both on business and lesiure.

All of which makes it a mystery why they don't bother to use box springs under the mattresses. The platform beds are low enough to accomodate them, and would be significantly more comfortable. A soft mattress with a rigid support really does not make for a nice bed. Unfortunately, a week of sleepless nights means no measure of friendly staff and amenities would make me return here.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Endwell, NY","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-01-16T14:55:50Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"564858","reviewId":"17729286","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Kate","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Thoroughly satisfied.","reviewText":"The Orchard Hotel is lovely boutique hotel within close proximity of Union Square.

They give you a password at check-in and cables, if needed. They also have a DVD movie library available. I also loved having a CD player to listen to music in the evening. Since this is a newly constructed Hotel, they installed special double pane windows that muffle the sound and although the cable car bell could be heard during the day, it was very quiet at night. The down comforter and pillows were a treat and the second pillow is not down (in case you are allergic). Our room was spacious and everything said in other reviews is true. It was a nice suprise to have Aveda products in the bath, robes and Frette linens on the bed! If you are in need of a small meeting room, their Boardroom is \"state of the art\", with no extra charges for wireless. Parking; valet at $38, is normal. You are in the city. Stay up the hill a little ways and it is $50 per night! Continental breakfast was perfect. Even with the tons of wonderful eateries close by, we stopped in one evening for a light dinner and drinks at the restaurant and had the most wonderful foie Gras and seared scallops.

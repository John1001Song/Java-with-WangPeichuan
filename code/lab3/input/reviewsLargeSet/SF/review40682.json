My room was one with a king size bed, which was surprisingly alright, however it took up almost all of the floor space in my room.

The really frustrating part was that even after I checked out at 6 am (my race started at 630) they charged me $10 more for an extra fee.

Located just a bit to far out of town for us. We had a weeks pass which was $28 & enabled you to travel all day every day on the trams (a must for San Francisco (and each journey on these is €6)), Street cars and buses. I would recommend the Airport shuttle if arriving in darkness as it can be a little nervous trying to locate and you do have to change to either the metro or street cars. The hotel itself is just a bit out of town for us. Only one Martini bar near which is not great if u enjoy a beer. Best area is around Union Square for bars and food eateries. We booked a non-smoking room and did have to move straight away because our first room stank of stale cigarettes but they did do this no problems. Room cleanliness was good. Fresh towels and toiletries every day. There are millions of street people living in San Francisco and all night long you can hear them going through the hotel bins. As one leaves the another would arrive to continue the same routine and you can hear the clicking of the bottles, cans and rubbish being constantly sieved through all night long! As there are so many street people it does make the streets a little nervous in the afternoon/evenings and I would recommend public transport for own piece of mind when returning back to the hotel. We asked the hotel to book a taxi for us for an early start but never arrived! Breakfast was sufficient.

Most places do not have it. It is rare to even consider wanting air conditioning in the City at night. One will encounter street people at Market and Valencia. Many are homeless; they have been there seemingly forever; they are not dangerous. I do not find any of the street people to be in any way intimidating or troubling. However, visitors who might be concerned, know who they are and should be advised. Regardless, any visitor should be street wise in any big city. Street noises are also a reality.

The furnishings in our room were clean/new enough, but the structure itself had some issues. Our ceiling had large water spots and was flaking, and the bathroom door was difficult to close and did not lock. There was also an obvious \"spot\" on the wall that the maid should and could have clean off, but didn't. The free breakfast was completely put away slighty before the advertised end time of 9 a.m. Who is up that early? Nobody! Finally, they advertise that they are three blocks from the Castro District, which might be true if you were measuring from the very edge. However, it is a pretty good hike from the center of the district, Market and Castro Streets. I can only suggest this hotel because 1) it is the second closest to the Castro and 2) there are worse hotels.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"San Jose, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2006-05-03T15:00:17Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"40682","reviewId":"17907731","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Eric","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Wonderful for the price","reviewText":"I'd go back to this hotel in a minute - despite it being a bit worn, the chair in my room wobbly, and a good bit of outside noise at bar closing time: 1) the price was unbeatable 2) the staff were wonderful 3) it was very clean.

The only real complaint was there was no A/C, but this is the norm in the city except for much higher priced properties. I stayed in a 4 star hotel on Nob Hill once with no A/C.

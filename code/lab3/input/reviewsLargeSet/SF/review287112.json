What a fantastic service to offer guests.  I loved my corner room with a comfy king-size bed.  The only bummer is that one night of my three night stay the room had carpet beetles but the hotel was quick to change out the bedding that night and treat the room the next day.  They offered to move me to another room but it was late at night and I was too tired to transfer to another room.  They were very accommodating though and very apologetic.

The hotel is located on a busy street, with limited access to a tiny valet access. The access was first blocked by a limo, causing me to wait in double line while said limo moved, only to be replaced by a U-Haul van. I took me getting out of my car and asking him what to do for him to even acknowledge me, only to tell me that in fact, this was the valet access AND CONTINUE TO CHAT WITH THE U HAUL DRIVER WHO WAS BLOCKING THE ACCESS. Enervated, I backed up in order to squeeze in within the tiny space the U Haul truck left, without any aid of the chatty valet guy. This whole time, my 7 years old was waiting with my wife in the car, eager to get into the hotel after a long drive. I backed up and moved forward at least 5 times in order to squeeze in the opening left by the truck, and eventually pulled trough, but not without scratching my car in the process (barricade on the street). When I complained furious about the attitude of the hotel guy on the street (STILL CHATTING at this point with the truck driver), I was told by the valet attendant that they are sorry. The bus boy was extremely helpful and after escorting us to our room, promised to follow up on my complaint. I did in fact get a message later in the day from the valet supervisor (the guy on the street) telling me \"he told me not to try to get in (a blatant lie)\" and \"that if it is a rental, the credit card should cover the damage\" - not a word of apology!

Which means, the entire first floor lobby is essentially one large club/bar. Good if you like that atmosphere. However, also means that it's very loud and noisy, and that you can't meet anybody there for a quiet conversation or for a family dinner. The actual reception / concierge area is also very small, and can get crowded at times.\n\nLocation: Good: right next to SF MOMA and Moscone convention center Bad: right next to a fire station. Be prepared for sirens at any time during the day and night.\n\nRoom: compared with club-like decor (dark with neon lights) of lobby and the corridor, surprisingly plain. Beds are comfortable, but room is smallish. And what is with the transparent door to the bathroom (right across the toilet)??\n\nAmenities: the gym is a joke. Just a few treadmills and a set of dumbbells. The pool is very small. Also, the power in the room went out suddenly, and half of the TV channels did not work most of the time. I've read similar complains from others --- seems to me that they have some endemic problem with their electronic system.\n\nStaff: friendly, but not quite helpful. Actually knew that TV didn't work, but didn't bother to tell me. Took a while to get the power problem fixed even after I called them.\n\nVerdict: Unless you really like the atmosphere of W hotel, there are other hotels nearby that offer better, at lower prices.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Korea","reviewSubmissionTime":"2012-04-14T23:07:58Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"hotelId":"287112","reviewId":"33784000","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":1,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Mike","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Disaster at the W","reviewText":"Reminded me of a \"college spring break\" hotel in Mazatlan.

We called room service to get plates for our cake - they said it would be $4 per plate which we thought was ridiculous! We went to bliss spa and i had a 75 minute blissage massage which was okay. I tried using the sauna which didn't seem to be working. My steam shower was very nice, but my friend used a different steam shower after her treatment and it never steamed. For a place that has a lobby full of lotions and potions to purchase i was very surprised at the bare bones locker room. I was hoping for at least a sample or 2 of lotion... I get more samples from Sephora!!! After spending $150 + $20 tip for a bare bones spa experience, i was disappointed and will not go back to the spa.

The only thing that I had a problem with was the fee for parking. But because of in and out privileges, It didn't bother me anymore. One bad note is that we got a room next to the elevator. The elevator was very loud and annoying when we were trying to get some rest. They tried to change the rooms for us but they said they were completely booked.

We had previously stayed at the W Seattle and didn't walk away thinking the hotel was all that great. So we took a chance on the W San Francisco and such a contrasting experience. The service was fantastic, from the front desk to the restaurant, to the spa. The spa is a nice feature in the hotel so that you can just go back up to your room and relax afterwards - recommend. XYZ Restaurant was nice. We only ordered appetizers, dessert, and drinks. But all were good. We also had reservations which was a very good idea. Service was prompt and friendly. Even from the hostess who took pictures for multiple couples that night. Definitely recommend the plate of cookies and milk for dessert. Indoor pool is a nice feature. Although when we went to use it, someone had broken glass in the pool so it was closed. Not the hotel's fault, but a bummer none the less. Room was very clean. Good size for two. The interior design was done quite well. Which is what this hotel is mostly known for. Overall, very happy with the stay and would like to try other W Hotels now.

The room was very clean, the beds were so comfortable, everything in the room was perfect. Everything about the W is very upscale, very high-class yet hip and trendy. My two complaints are the following: 1. To use the computers in the business center, you have to pay $6.95 per 15 minutes. Many other expensive hotels I've stayed at provide not only free computer access in the business center but also free printing and faxing. I wanted to look up a few things, being unfamiliar with San Francisco, but I could only look up so much for 15 minutes. I get that the hotel charges for in-room internet usage. That is pretty standard, but to charge for computer usage in the business center and at such a high price...that was frustrating and disappointing. It makes a guest feel as though the hotel is trying to squeeze every dollar it can out of you. 2. No gift shop. I know that not everyone likes souvenirs but I'm not asking for tacky things. Maybe some nice zip-up hoodies with \"W San Francisco\" in small embroidery on the left corner. Also, it would be nice to have a gift shop in the lobby for any incidentals you forgot or need, i.e. cold medicine, a soda, a magazine, etc. Other than those two complaints, I would highly recommend the W.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Venice, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-07-16T22:17:32Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"4","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_ca","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"287112","reviewId":"17835913","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"4105","userNickname":"Rachael","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Very modern and cool San Francisco hotel","reviewText":"The W hotel was the final stop for us on a tour of San Francisco and the wine country.

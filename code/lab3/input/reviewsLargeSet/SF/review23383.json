Go up to the room on the 5th floor but it's coming in through the ducts!  I call and the operator says she's never heard of such a thing so I contact the front desk, who despite working in a lobby smelling like fried onions, doesn't know about the smell but will send an engineer.  The engineer arrives and says something's wrong with their duct system.  They're stopping cooking and the smell will go away shortly.  The smell never went away.  I had a wedding to attend the next day and there's no dry cleaning fast enough that will take the smell out, so I spray on extra perfume.  It's really really gross to sleep in a hotel room smelling of fried onions. The next day it smells like fried fish.  The day afterward, it smelled it fried somosas.  I mean these are delicious smells in a kitchen so their food is probably amazing, but really disgusting to sleep in that smell and have all your clothes smell awful.  Also, their operator and front desk pretending not to notice, when I called is, super awkward.  I had to speak with front desk in person for them to acknowledge it but they just said it'll go away... every day they said this.  Perhaps they're working in that 24/7 and can't tell the difference anymore but it's super noticeable to anyone who steps through the front door.\r\nAlso, this hotel is not sound proofed, so you can hear other people's showers running early in the morning and late at night; also you hear all deliveries.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"Location was central.

That room was a large, king bed room with a very large chaise lounge/couch at the food of the bed.   It was to be a city view room, but the window was quite small and had another love seat directly in front of it.  The room was nice, but had way too much furniture in it.

The reason I keep coming back is for this very reason, the service can't be beat.  Besides that though, the rooms are comfy, clean, and roomy (we stayed in the deluxe room).  I also love the fact that the staff take the time to remember your name which is a small thing but makes you feel you're coming home.  During our stay, one of our dogs got sick and threw up on the room floor which was cleaned up promptly.  But upon checkout they did charge us extra for a deep cleaning that they had to do ($300).  That was a little steep but I didn't mind, and I agreed to pay.  A couple days later though I saw on my bank statement that they had refunded me the fee in full!  When I called them I was told that they didn't charge me for it, and that it was free of charge, a \"Labor Day surprise\".  Awesome!!!

I have to say that I was disappointed with a number of things at the hotel. Firstly our room was very small and you could hear the occupants of the neighbouring room well into the night. For me the staff have their favourite guests that obviously stay at the hotel on a regular basis. They were so busy falling over certain guests on the Saturday morning at breakfast that we could not find anyone to sign off the breakfast bill. When we returned to breakfast on Sunday I had a very embarrassing moment where a member of staff said that we had left without paying in front of all the other guests at breakfast. I also had another embarrassing moment when we came to check out of the hotel as well. My deal included breakfast for my wife and I yet when it came to check out this was not taken off the bill. Despite phoning down the night before to ensure all would be well with this. 15 minutes of arguing on the way out and finally the receptionist agreed with what i was saying.\nThe only positive was that given that we were on our honeymoon the hotel kindly gave us a bottle of champagne to celebrate.\nI would not recommend this hotel to business colleagues who travel to San Francisco regularly, and I would not use the hotel again.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"Good location","negativeRemarks":"Communication of staff","locationRemarks":"Great location and easy access to all the sites of San Francisco","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"England","reviewSubmissionTime":"2014-05-12T07:15:34Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"David","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"23383","reviewId":"70151004","photos":[],"itinId":"171024363511","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Perfect location for a long weekend","reviewText":"We visited S.F. for a long weekend of walking, dining and reconnecting with old friends.\nThe Taj Campton was at the heart of our wonderful visit and location.

I can say that the hotel is well located, nicely appointed, has a comfortable bed and friendly staff. I had a problem with the place and wouldn't stay there because of the following:\n- The plumbing was noisy and vibrated from time to time.\n- At this room price range, I wasn't expecting to be charged for the internet connection. I thought that was a bit petty. And, the internet was not terribly fast and would get hung up for several seconds up to a minute or so from time to time. Lastly on this topic, only one device is allowed to be connected per room. So, if your computer is connected, then your partner/wife/significant other's device cannot be connected, and there is no free internet in the lobby.\n- The room was a bit too small for my taste.\n- There was a night club that ran until the early hours of the morning whose front door was just below my window, and there was no warning from the staff about this, so it was very difficult to get to sleep because of that.\n- When my neighbor left his unit, his door closing would cause all the walls of my unit to vibrate as if he had slammed his door.\n- The staff allowed me a 13:00 checkout on my last day there, but still the cleaning staff was knocking on my door at 10:00 to clean my room, so they were clearly not notified by the front desk staff.....","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"The location is its best attribute.","negativeRemarks":"See above.","locationRemarks":"Close to Powell Street Bart and cable cars.

We had booked a deluxe king room and having looked on the hotel website was expecting a large room with a chaise long and a separate walk-in shower. However, we were given a smaller room (no chaise long) with a shower over the bath (and barely enough wardrobe space for one person's clothing, let alone two). I rang down to reception and explained that the room wasn't as expected. I was told that all the rooms were of different specifications but that they would check availability for another deluxe king room. Within minutes reception rang back and said they would be sending someone up to show us another room. This room was exactly as shown and described on the website, so we moved our luggage and checked into the room. The wardrobe space was more than double that of the previous room and the room itself was so much bigger. And the bathroom, well I could have happily lived in there! A walk-in shower (as expected!) by the side of the bath and the bath also had a shower head by the taps which could be pulled out and lengthened when needed. The room was cleaned daily and the bed turned down at night. Everything was spotless. The bed was really comfortable, although we did spot a stack of books underneath it which appeared to be holding it up in the middle!! However, we wouldn't have known this had we not seen them.

But the location was amazing because I loveee shopping and I didnt have to walk far to drop off all my bags! But as far as the service, it was IMPECCABLE! I seriously felt like a spoiled princess, anything we needed they took care of and quickly at that. One night my boyfriend decided to book us in room swedish massages and he made this decision at 7pm that night. Well the front desk concierge called around and within in 45 minutes we had a couples in room massage booked for 8:30pm that same night. To top it all off both of our massage tables wouldnt fit in our room so the hotel opened up the room next to us for me to have my massage in.

The room itself was a bit bare (one picture on the wall) and the furnishings did not seem to live up to the general elegance of the hotel.

One dish, the white asparagus, was truly awful. We are fatigued with restaurants charging huge prices and failing to deliver the goods.

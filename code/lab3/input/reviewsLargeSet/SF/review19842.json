The room came with a fridge and microwave, but the fridge constantly made noise which I was able to tune out, and kept freezing my beverages, but I was eventually able to fix it.\r\n\r\nThe staff were relatively friendly, and the cleaning staff did not speak much English, although they were nice enough.\r\n\r\nThe major drawback is that the walls are paper-thin.  There was a couple above me making loud noises until after 2:00 AM on my last night that kept me up, and I could hear people talking at even a conversational level in the other rooms.\r\n\r\nIf you're on a budget, and want walkability, and don't plan to spend a lot of time in your room, I would recommend it.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"The location!","negativeRemarks":"I'm not sure anything can be done about the noise transfer, given the age of the building, but the bathrooms could stand to be a little nicer.","locationRemarks":"Nice and central, close to the performing arts district and public transit.","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Toronto, Canada","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-02-25T18:39:47Z","roomTypeId":464044,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"30029","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"hotelId":"19842","reviewId":"56cf3d25831e450981563ce2","photos":[],"itinId":"12873017982","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"HMP MMD","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Hip Granny","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Clean, quiet, great location for symphony, opera, ","reviewText":"Great walkable location for arts venues.

The only thing I could recommend is to have a car for this stay, as there is no public transport to the center of the city. We could use complementary transport from our hotel to any place within 4 miles from 7 am to 7 pm, but there is a reservation needed at least 2 hours in advance, which is not mentioned in any hotel info letter , that is why we could not use this service. We were depended on private shuttle services and taxis, which is very expensive if someone moves a lot around the city. The nearest bus to the center ( Hollywood ) is about 45 minutes fast walk from the hotel and is takes about 90 minutes to get there with two buses. I tried it once and never again.

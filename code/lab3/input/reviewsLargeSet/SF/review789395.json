Although the bed is comfy, It's hard to sleep I can hear our neighbors close the door, showering, flushing, talking plus the street is unbelievably noisy from Police car and fire truck siren almost every 10-20 mins all night. We were already in the top floor so i can't imagine the other guests on the lower levels. No airconditioner in the room and you can't open the window because of the noise. The room and hallway has also a weird smell. Free breakfast is okay.. Waffle, Bread, cereal and yogurt. They need to add atleast one or two more toaster because one is not enough for all the guest in the hotel. Hotel is close to union square, chinatown and cable car.. The staff are super friendly but one cleaning staff in the morning not so friendly.. Not even an excuse or sorry for sweeping the floor behind me while I was waiting for the front desk (She was sweeping towards me and our luggage without saying anything).","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-09-15T16:40:27Z","roomTypeId":201161140,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":true,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"4","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_ca","totalThanks":1,"hotelId":"789395","reviewId":"57cef1a30454a80b5672da98","photos":[],"itinId":"1145246774663","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"4105","userNickname":"Tom","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Decent hotel for the price in a good location","reviewText":"Although it should come as no surprise to anyone, San Francisco is quickly becoming one of the more expensive destinations to visit. Cost of living is skyrocketing and this is reflected in the high cost of hotels in downtown. The Adante Hotel, although slightly less expensive than the higher end hotels, was still way overpriced for what you get, in my opinion. The walls are paper thin. You can pretty much hear conversations happening on the other side of the wall and in the hallway, which is consistent with the age of the building. This is only an issue when you're trying to sleep while your neighbors are still up. The rooms were relatively clean; I'll give them that. And the continental breakfast was decent. But the overall age of the hotel, creaky stairs, slow elevator, etc. make it tough to swallow for the price. But when compared to the competition, this hotel is in line or slightly cheaper than the others. The location was good, only a few blocks away from Union Square, but definitely a few seedy individuals on the streets outside at night, but we found that everywhere in downtown.

When I got to my room it smelled really good, I would love if anyone from the staff see this comment can tell me the spray that they used? lol  I would appreciate it. The room was really tiny than what I was expecting. I didn't really like that outside my window was like another apartment and I can see people looking at me from the other side but me and my friend just close the curtains and problem solved. The bed was big but very comfortable to sleep in. The maid clean up my room every morning but there were some days where I can still see some stains on the sheets and I didn't really like it. I felt safe even walking at night although I was impressed by how many homeless people I saw on the streets, I felt really bad. There are some people who don't like this in an area but hey I come from NYC and guess what, we also have homeless people everywhere it's not only in SF. That didn't really bothered me since one day I was walking around by one of the most expensive hotels and I also saw that their location was just like this one, there were a lot of homeless people.

Probably needs some better soundproofing on certain room windows.\r\n\r\nThe bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was clean, despite it being dated.\r\n\r\nLocation - as long as you are walking toward union square and not up into the loin you won't have any troubles.\r\n\r\nSo all in all... not a horrible stay, the noisy nights were my biggest complaint. If you're on a budget trip and can deal with certain imperfections and annoyances this place is worth a look.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":1,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"- Comfy beds","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"C","userLocation":"Sydney, Australia","reviewSubmissionTime":"2015-03-30T19:20:35Z","roomTypeId":200420239,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"4","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_ca","totalThanks":1,"hotelId":"789395","reviewId":"550c8b63e4b06bf69d56b282","photos":[],"itinId":"196096487359","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"HMP MMD","managementResponses":[{"isFlaggable":false,"userNickname":"Fernando ","displayLocale":"en_US","date":"2015-03-28T00:00:07Z","id":"9ec1dce7-3a48-4a96-ae66-c5baf5432028","response":"Hello\n\nThank you for Staying at the Adante Hotel we appreciate your business.\n\nI'm glad that my Housekeeping staff is working hard and very happy that you were able to check in early.\n\nThink of us on your next trip to San Francisco","status":"APPROVED"}],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"4105","userNickname":"LH","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Decent location","reviewText":"Room was ready...even though we arrived before the stated check-in time.\r\nStaff offered to arrange tours, shuttles, etc., for us.\r\n","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"Proximity to transit.

The staff member looked perturbed and begrudgingly began to help me. He was crude and barely explained what was going on. He asked for my ID and payment card and all but threw it back at me after he was finished with it. The other issue I had was that the cost of parking doubled and I explained to the staff that I called to verify the parking rate and was quoted a cheaper price, the staff refused to honor the original price and I had to end up paying  $85 for parking! The plus side is that the room was clean, however, the cost of the room was not worth it.

However, when I checked-in, I was given a cheaper standard queen room. The reception staff could not differentiate between the Junior Queen Suite and standard Queen Room. So, I had to make an overseas call to expedia.sg at 1AM (in San Francisco). Finally, in the morning, I was given a junior king suite. However, that free upgrade could not satisfy me as I could not connect to Wi-Fi properly. Whenever I managed to connect, the speed was horrible. Room heater did not work for a single night.

The building is very run down internally in a part of downtown area with very interesting people on the streets (that is why the hotel entrance is locked from 11am-7pm). The couches at the foyer/waiting area are worn with holes and wears. There is NO bar or a separate quiet sitting area in this hotel. The staff is friendly but tries very hard to selling you various vacation packages. The cleaner or air fresher used in the rooms are absolutely intoxicating. I have to open the door/window for hours to get the odor out. The bed sheets are worn with holes and you can see lint all over the blanket - So if you are allergic to lint - you will have a problem. There is no mini fridge or kettle. Water is provided at cost. There is no personal cleaning supplies provided, besides a very small bottle of shampoo and location. There is a Walgreens 1.5 blocks west where you can get your supplies.\n\nIf you are a light sleeper, you will have a serious problem. The walls are paper thin, and you can almost hear everything being said next door. A very good pair of earplugs are highly recommended!!!\n\nIf you are out day and night and just need a place for your luggage and to lie down for a few hours over the night, this is an okay place.\n\nRecommended: open the window and door upon arrival if you do not want smell cleaner during the rest of your stay.

I paid $200 less per night than my colleagues. It's obviously not a new hotel, don't expect Taj Mahal, it's a quick small place for people who need a bed and a shower. Adante needs a bit more upkeep, but at the same time it better than a lot places I've been before. No smoke or mildew smells anywhere I was in the hotel (and I have a pretty sense of smell). I didn't eat the breakfast because I'm not an Eggo eater but everyone else seemed to enjoy them. Overall the hotel itself is fine for quick travelers but I wouldn't bring my daughter to these streets. Hotel personnel were excellent. But you have to understand you're not staying at the Ritz, there's no doorman or anything and it takes a moment to get your key, but they were always curteous and offered help before I asked. They are as accommodating as they can be given there are some things out of there control. They let me check in very early, but the next guests couldn't because there was not a room available for their reservation but that's not Adante's problem.

I gave the man (in his motorized wheelchair) a cigarette, then he proceeded to ask for money to buy his own smokes. I told him he was lucky to get one from me and I'd give him no money. Well, the man got a little upset and started explaining how he lived in the hotel and didn't have a job.. Long story short, he was unemployed and begging for money outside of the hotel he lived at. I thought this was tacky and told the front desk that they should monitor this. There was also an incident where I helped escort a blind/disoriented woman into the building from a cab.

I basically just needed a place to sleep after being out all day sightseeing. If you are looking for a resort or extras then the Adante is not for you. The free breakfast the hotel provided was fine. I had all the buttered toast I could eat. You make it yourself so its nice and hot. They also have coffee, tea, juice, and muffins. There is no A/C but most hotels, and even homes, in San Francisco don't have A/C. It never gets hot enough for it. You can open your window in your room and there is also a ceiling fan. If you are out sightseeing during the day you won't even be there at the warmest part of the day. At night it gets very cool in San Francisco. The bathroom was very big, almost as big as the room, and very nice. There is free (wired) high speed internet access in the rooms, and also an internet cafe connected to the hotel in case you don't have a laptop. However you will have to pay to use those internet cafe computers. The hotel is only a few blocks from Union Square - the heart of San Francisco and access point for cable cars, BART, MUNI, etc. There is also a bus that stops right in front of the hotel, the #38 bus, that will take you to Ocean Beach. That is the wide, sandy beach they have there. Other buses can be caught on nearby streets. Overall the Adante is a good value for your money, putting you near the heart of San Francisco while not breaking your budget.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Fairfax, VA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-06-18T13:05:07Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"789395","reviewId":"17865227","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Hillary","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Loved It","reviewText":"The location was amazing-3 blocks from Union Sqaure, 4 blocks from Chinatown, 6 blocks from the Cable Cars and SFMOMA, and about a 30 minute walk to Fisherman's Wharf!

The service was excellent. The desk clerks were very helpful. Our room was a bit small, but it was just fine for us. We were on the top (seventh) floor, and there was no A/C (there was a ceiling fan), and it was a little warm, but not too bad. We slept better than we do at home--our queen bed was quite comfortable. There was no screen on the window, which was annoying. Our room was very quiet--hardly heard a thing. The bathroom looked like it was newly renovated. There was an Internet hookup in the room--bring your own cable (we did), because I think they charge you to use one of theirs. Continental breakfast was skimpier than most: coffee, orange juice, white and wheat toast (w/ butter and jam), and fake blueberry muffins. The neighborhood was relatively safe--there were panhandlers, but they were not nearly as aggressive as I would have thought. (I gave a few muffins away :). We walked around all over, even at night. (I would have been slightly uncomfortable walking around at night with children, though.) It takes just a few minutes to walk to Union Square, cable car lines, the subway, and regional rail lines -- a few minutes more for the Convention Center and the Museum of Modern Art. Maybe 10-15 minutes walk to Chinatown. Same for Bay Bridge area.

The hotel is centrally located. It is indeed not far from the sketchy part of the city (to the right as you exit the hotel), but if you keep to the left as you exit the hotel, no worries. It is safe and only three blocks away from Union Square and all the restaurants and shopping. My room was on the 7th floor. It was definitely neither new nor well decorated, but it was clean and had all the elements one really needs: comfy bed, good water pressure in the shower, spacious bathroom, telephone in the room, TV, hairdryer, coffee maker, iron and ironing board. If you are going to San Fran to hang out in your room, then you might want to pay more and stay somewhere fancy, but if you are there to explore and enjoy the city, this hotel is a great option. Some people in previous postings complained about the lack of AC, but I found the ceiling fan quite sufficient (even for June). The hotel staff was exceptional and very friendly. The internet café staff next door was super cool and you can also count on wicked music there, as well as great recommendations on places to check out. Overall, I will definitely be staying here again on my next visit.

The staff was very nice and helpful. The bus line is right in front of the hotel door. Yes, the hotel room is small, barely fits the bed and not too many drawers, but we used the night stands and were able to empty out our luggage. You just have to be organized. The bed was so comfortable which was great after a long day of walking. The shower gave lots of hot water and good pressure every single time. Because of the great price we stayed four nights and are so glad that we did. Yes, it is downtown San Fran so as others have mentioned, you will see the homeless in the vicinity, just like any other citys downtown area. Around the hotel, it was maybe one or two here and there, definitely not like the Union Square area where they panhandle and come up to you. There were a few times that I woke up to hear banging or yelling in the alley, but turned around and went back to sleep. There was not a single time that I didn't feel safe there. Half a blk away is Dotties cafe, great for breakfast but get in line by 7:00 am if you want a table. We recommend two people split the Open Road plate because it is a lot of food for one, and we can eat, no diets for us. We never had any problems with the hotel.

When using Expedia I did not expect to be staying at the Inn on Broadway instead of Francisco Bay Inn we had booked. That was extremely frustrating considering we had luggage and were on foot. Not a good start to say the least. When we arrived at the sister site motel, the smell of mildew and cleaner was over powering. We had to turn on the a/c full blast to drown it out although it was cold inside already. The sheets did seem clean but the bathroom had hair through the sink and tub which is disgusting. For a night out in the city when everything else is booked I figured we had no other options as we were just using it to sleep. I would never recommend nor stay there again. I am very disappointed with Expedia for the bait and switch with no notice or better option as well.

The first impression of the Francisco Bay Inn was not the best. From the outside it looked like a cheap,  run-down,  road-side motel, but our impression changed in the minute we registered at the front desk since the reception was very welcoming and warming.  The room itself was well sized, clean, with TV, refrigerator, AC but without any special amenities or charm. The breakfast was a tray of doughnuts, a bottle of hot water and a can of instant coffee placed on a small table at the reception.

The road this hotel is located on is one of the busiest roads in San Francisco with lorrys and traffic all night long. Usually this wouldn't be an issue in a decent hotel but the windows were as thin as PVC so you heard everything I got absolutely no sleep whatsoever. The final nail in the coffin as mentioned in the prior reviews is the breakfast. It is left in the reception area which is the size of a toilet you can only enter one at a time, so in the morning the queue for breakfast was about an hour. Once you finally get in as the room is tiny the food always runs out. I arrived at 8am and the milk and cereal had finished. The only choice for breakfast is cheerios or brown bread I am not joking.

Well worth the money - close to a lot!","reviewText":"First off, I think anyone who has never been to San Francisco and rates this hotel as \"too loud with street traffic\" should not be counted, LOL!  Of course staying on Lombard St. you're going to have some noise from the street. That should be expected. The hotel is nice enough to provide ear plugs right by your bedside for those that need them!  I've stayed at many hotels in SF on Lombard and other busy streets and have never had any provide us ear plugs!  We didn't need them, as the noise is not THAT bad (and our hotel room was facing the street). You get used to it, or maybe I just expected it!\r\nThe free parking is another great feature of this hotel.  It's hard to find decent hotels with parking included. Normally they charge $30-$50+/night.  We arrived on a Sat night, around 6pm, and their lot was full, with the exception of one small spot. We have a pretty large SUV and it was a very tight fit. When I asked if they had another lot, the lady at the front desk was very accommodating and offered for us to park in the lined spot next to the hanicapped spot.  That worked out perfectly!\r\nThe front desk staff, both evening and mornings, were very polite and helpful. \r\nTheir breakfast included in the morning was more than I expected. Normally when hotels advertise \"breakfast included\", it means you get your choice of a packaged pastry and coffee/OJ.  Francisco Bay Inn had a large variety, including muffins, toast, oatmeal, donuts, English muffins, etc..!  \r\nI HIGHLY recommend them!!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Reno, NV","reviewSubmissionTime":"2015-01-08T22:28:28Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"890830","reviewId":"10001381789","photos":[],"itinId":"194567104310","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Jamie","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Excellent Customer Service","reviewText":"Great price, walking distance to Fishermans Wharf and Pier 39.

It was functional as a budget room, but not very pleasant.\n\nIn room facilities were fairly basic - we had a coffee machine and fresh coffee, but no milk or sugar to put in it. The coffee jug lip was also chipped, so coffee went all over the carpet.\n\nBreakfast is a stack of pasties and muffins, fruit and hot coffee. It's in a side room and your help yourself, so all fairly convenient if you're in a hurry.\n\nThe location isn't really that great for anywhere for tourists - it's a long walk to the piers or the hipper areas, there isn't much to do in the area.

They have to double park some cars, and I didn't use my car at night for fear of coming back to the hotel without a place to park.\n\nThis is billed as a budget hotel, and I suppose you sacrifice some conveniences with a lower cost.

This hotel was our second and next to last night of the drive. The hotel itself was a pain to drive to with GPS taking us thru the heart of San Fran. Once we got there, the hotel was a pretty hefty walk to the wharf and crooked street. Neither of us complained about vehicle traffic or road noise, my complaint is about parking, our room and breakfast. For the price, I expected WAY more than we got. Parking was jammed packed with vehicles double parked; I was nervous about my new Vette getting dinged. Our room was a little crazy; you could literally feel every spring in the mattress and there was a big sag in the middle. The bathroom had 8 light switches and four of them did nothing. Also, our room shared an entrance with another room and those people would stand in the aisle in front of our shared entrance smoking their stuff. You could also hear their door open and close every time. The breakfast in the morning was horrible....ran out of everything, even coffee. It was the worst breakfast of the three hotels we stayed in on this trip. We ended up going to a restaurant.

The noise from the street wasn't bad at all, but the noise from upstair was appalling. Those people returned to their room late at night. I'm not sure what they were actually doing in the upstair room, but from my room, it sounded like they were jumping up and down or throwing things around. Their every footstep was not only so loud, it actually made my room's ceiling shake to a point that the ceiling lights were flickering. I was starting to fear that the ceiling may collapse on me any time. The reception desk closes at 11 pm, and there was no hotel staff answering any phone calls after 11 pm.

That's all you can say about it. If you're looking for a place that has a bed, is clean, and you don't mind paying about the same rate as you would a 3 star then knock yourself out. The place is run down somewhat but kept in a stable condition. It definitely doesn't catch your eye when you drive by and it also gives you that \"oh what have I done\" feeling when you walk in. I will say that the room seemed to be very clean as well as the bathroom.... almost to a level that was impressive. However, it doesn't change the fact that its run down. The elevator works but is extremely slow. It just makes you feel that you have a 50/50 shot of actually making it to your floor before it plummets to the ground. It is extremely noisy there as its right next to a very busy street. Those that had commented on the noise were 100% right. I'm a very heavy sleeper so it didn't bother me but it did others in my party. As far as the location, its definitely a hike to get anywhere.

Short walk to Fishermans Wharf, the marina, and the Fort Mason/GGB area. Also plenty of little eateries and grocers in the area. The bus stop is a short walk away, which is by far the best and easiest way to get around town. I thought the streetcars were going to be the way, but they're expensive and don't go to many areas, the buses cover it all just pick up a map. My hotel room was nice and clean. Good bed, clean sheets. Bathroom was bigger than your typical hotel room and was clean as well. TV was kinda small and the reception wasn't too great, but I only watched it at night falling asleep and in the morning while packing my bag, so it wasn't a huge deal. The 'breakfast' the hotel has is a joke, but I just went to a great cafe a few blocks away, so I would suggest a similar path. Traffic noise outside the hotel started getting loud early, but I had to wake up early anyways so no big deal. All in all, not a bad stay.

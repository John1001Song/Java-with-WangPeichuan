It didn't take too long and the room was clean when we got inside. The room is pretty small but I didn't expect anything else from the old building. We had no problems with the hotel during our stay there. The breakfast was pretty limited to two types of cereal, breakfast claws, toast, and waffles. But it was enough to fill us up. There is a corner store about two buildings down and that was really convenient for water. Even though it's near Tenderloin, we didn't feel unsafe but I wouldn't recommend going out too late either.

Felt safe walking around the area with the children.  Apartment had  ample space for party of 5 with enough rooms to have two in sleep mode and still areas to sit. Very well equipped - a real curtain in the bedroom and a clothes horse would be nice but minor.  Was quiet but if apartment above had noisey occupants potential for disturbance.  Great find if you want to stay in a residential area and explore.

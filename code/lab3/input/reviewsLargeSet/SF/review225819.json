Which was very confusing to our taxi driver, who couldn't find it!). So this is now the Hotel Zelos!\r\n\r\nFirstly, although I had booked this hotel 8 months ago, somehow my booking had been mixed up and they didn't have the room type available I had booked. I wanted a room with 2 beds - they only had rooms with 1 bed. Fortunately they gave us a 2nd room to use for free for the 2 nights, but it was still disconcerting the booking had been messed up when I'd made it so long ago.\r\n\r\nThe TV system was having issues. In both our rooms there would be times where you couldn't get beyond the main menu screen. Also they have disconnected the ability to connect your own devices to the TV to watch your own movies etc - this was annoying and we have not come across this in any other hotels. Presumably a way to force you to pay for movies to watch from their selection?\r\n\r\nOn the final day, although we were not wanting to use it, I noticed the restaurant was closed for breakfast because of a power failure. Almost feels like the name change is causing teething problems.

The sink & shower did not drain very well but housekeeping came to fix it as soon as we called.  The Dirty Habit restaurant/bar was delicious and the outdoor patio/fireplace was breathtaking.  Customer service throughout the hotel from the Dirty Habit, housekeeping, the bellman and the front desk were top notch with the exception of the on-duty manager, Whitney.  She was condescending and rude to us on a number of occasions...including speaking poorly about me in the presence of my daughter/niece when I went to the garage to locate a bag that was misplaced by the bellman.

After the first night, we asked about switching to a larger room, but were told we would have to wait until noon the next day before changes could be made. Needless to say, we were ready at noon to see what our options might be, but the front end manager kept stalling. By the time we finally saw another room (around 2 pm) and decided it wasn't any better, we decided to go to another hotel. If we had stayed, we would have had to live out of our suitcases for the six days because there was no place to store our clothes in the room. In addition to being the worst possible experience, I can’t think of one redeeming quality of the hotel or our stay. We did not sleep well that first night because the mattress was as hard as a rock, the room was not properly secured, the temperature of the room could not be controlled, and noise from the restaurant on the floor below was excessive. I doubt that I will ever stay at another Kimpton Hotel. It is hard to understand how other travelers can provide such positive reviews.

We had an inward facing room but could still hear the street and wasn't bothered at all by it. The hotel itself was silent.

The location of this hotel is unbeatable - just off Market, a main street where trams, metro, BART and buses run to just about all over the city, just around the corner from Westfield Shopping Mall, and only a couple of blocks from Union Square. The rooms are quiet, very comfortable, decorated in a smart, contemporary style with fab beds and crisp, clean linen. The only thing that my mother wanted for was tea/coffee making facilities, but when I mentioned it to the porter who brought our luggage he brought a coffee maker right up to the room at no charge. The bathrooms were a real pleasure to use, with granite basins, fluffy towels and nice toiletries (L'Occitane), and most importantly the shower was excellent. The robes were another nice touch - instead of standard white they are in animal print, which is such a fun idea.

Also they take $300 dollars in \"advance\" charges on your credit card, even if you have already paid for your room. They do have a gym with modern equipment, but it was the size of a closet!

My most favorite part was when I would return to my room later in the day, to find my bed turned down for the evening and the radio lightly playing jazz music. Each evening I looked forward to hearing the sound of soulful music filling my room. It made my busy schedule come to a closure and made my stay feel like home away from home!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Chicago, IL","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-01-13T04:06:58Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"225819","reviewId":"18107894","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Darcy","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great Location, Hip Decor, Quiet Rooms","reviewText":"Great location,convenient to Union Square, Metrione, Chinatown and public transportation.

The last time we traveled to the Bay Area, I had to face reality: The Palomar was sold out! So we stayed at another hotel, and we regretted it. We missed everything about the Palomar the whole time we were there.\n\nThe rooms are done in a sedate (not cutesy or garish) boutique style. The lobby is small but personal, \nand the staff are unfailingly pleasant. We *love* being steps from the Muni/BART subway -- it makes getting to and from the airport (and visiting friends in the East Bay or San Francisco's neighborhoods) a snap.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Seattle, WA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2004-11-30T19:36:03Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Anita","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"225819","reviewId":"18107964","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"KC","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Excellent!","reviewText":"This hotel is absolutely fabulous!

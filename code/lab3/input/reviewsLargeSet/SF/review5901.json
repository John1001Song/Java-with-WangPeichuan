The room I stayed had a strong urine odor, but we went in it very much so I didn't complain. But the second night after moving my daughter into her university dorm, I wanted a nice rest. The room again had a strong odor and as I sit on the sheet, I started to develop a rash. I called down to the desk, he asked if this happened the night before, I told him the odor was there but not the rash. To their credit, they moved us to another room and it was fine. The next day, I notice a charger cable was missing. I think it may have been on the bed and the maid accidentally removed it with the sheets. It was never found.\r\nThe area around the hotel is quiet and full of restaurants. it's also convenient to go to USF.\r\n\r\nThe Bad: The room. It just felt uncomfortable. I also scrapped my leg against the bed frame several times as it protrudes and has a sharp corner. The smell of the first room I was in was not desirable. The 2nd room was much better.

It really is very noisy when you move around, and the comfort was adequate. I admit, however, that we have a Sleep Number bed at home, so that makes just about any other bed less than comfortable. For a hotel bed, it actually wasn't bad (I've slept in much worse). I know some reviews sound awful, but all I can guess is that they had a rare bad experience or their expectations were way too high and then complained when they weren't shown a royal suite. I'm really picky about hotels--I won't stay at the same place twice if I found the accommodations to be sub-par in any way; and it's very difficult to earn a perfect rating from me, even if I really enjoyed the place.

Because it is in Japantown, the immediate area is rather quiet at night, but that is what we wanted for sound sleeping. However, there are nice little restaurants and coffee shops/cafes within a couple of blocks distance. While we didn't rent a car and thus relied on public transportation/taxis the whole trip, the hotel ideally seems to be centrally located as our taxi rides for sightseeing, dinner and entertainment to the various areas of SF were always right about $9 - $12. Hotel Tomo was clean, rather quiet, and we found the staff pleasant, professional and happy to assist with our questions. The hotel's decor is fun (anime-themed) and the A/C and lights are connected to an energy-saving system that depends on your room key for control (not complicated to use at all). On the \"small but important\" side of things, the pillows were nicely firm, the way I like them, and not the usual flimsy wimpy hotel pillows at all. If you want to stay in the lap of luxury, then this isn't for you, but if you just want a clean, safe, quiet and nice conveniently located place to sleep at night while seeing San Fran, we can definitely recommend Hotel Tomo.

Very casual, simple, and mostly tidy. The hallways and elevator seems sort of \"cheaply\" appointed, not in a \"snobby comment\" kind of way, just honestly like their contractor painted over best western colors and tried to freshen up a very old property. Carpets could use cleaning as well. They were stained quite a bit in the room.\nMost of that is just commenting more than complaining. I really had no complaints at all. The staff was helpful and very friendly. The let us have our room early and were always courteous. The maid service was nice and through as well. As far as the part of town, its in Japantown. Not much to eat after 10PM unless you walk 10-15 minutes or take the bus elsewhere. the #2 and #3 bus run frequently right out front straight to downtown and areas near. We were going to a concert at the Civic Center and it was a 15 minute walk or 15 minute bus ride by the time it snakes around and get there. Either was it was convenient enough.

Nice property, cute decor, friendly staff. Room service was very friendly and courteous, as well as the front desk. My only complaint about the property is that our room had no accessible electrical outlets. Zero. Nada. This explains why some of the furniture in the room was moved at odd angles away from the walls - so that the hidden electrical outlets behind the desk and nightstand could be found. There was a very nice and spacious computer desk, for example - but NO electrical outlets to use!! We had to pull the desk out further so that we could reach around to plug in our laptops. Same for charging the phone on the nightstand. This is a very easy issue to resolve - they need to install mounted power strips for easy access. This is obvious, but but I guess that doesn't keep people from ignoring it. At any rate - bring a power strip.\n\nMore about the area: Japantown is a surprisingly nice and quiet area to stay, with an authentic Japanese urban feel. Unlike Chinatown, Japantown is an actual established Japanese community in the Pacific Heights area of the city. Lots of Japanese-Americans live in and work in this area - but there seemed to be very little tourist traffic overall. No crowds whatsoever... just a lot of \"local\" Japanese - it was a great place to start and end the day during our visit.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"Quiet, clean & comfortable stay in a great part of town.","negativeRemarks":"Nowhere to plug in your gadgets!!","locationRemarks":"Japantown is a great place to start and end the day.. quiet, peaceful and an authentic Japanese-American community.","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Denver, CO","reviewSubmissionTime":"2012-05-03T03:14:43Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Micah","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":2,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":2,"hotelId":"5901","reviewId":"34130399","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Vudaddy","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Japan Town","reviewText":"I didn't want to spend an arm and leg but rooms are expensive in San Francisco.

THE WALL OUTLET( FOR TV FRIDGE, COFFEE MAKER, LAP TOP) HAD ONLY ONE POWER OUTLET WORKING. HAD TO SWITCH BETWEEN USING THE TV AND FRIDGE OR ANY OTHERS. THE BATHROOM TOWEL RACK WAS LITERALLY FALLING OFF THE WALL. THE CURTAINS HAD CIGARETTE BURNS IN THEM. THE FURNITURE WAS SCRATCHED DENTED, WELL USED. THE ONLY REASON I STAYED HERE WAS THE CONVENIENCE TO YOSHIS JAZZ CLUB WITCH IS WALKING DISTANCE. THIS HOTEL WAS PRETTY MUCH A DUMP WHEN IT WAS CALLED THE BEST WESTERN MIAYKO. NOW THE TOMO ALTHOUGH NEWLY PAINTED AND DECORATED IT IS STILL A DUMP WITH CLUELESS EMPLOYEES, FLAT OUT LIES ABOUT ITS CURRENT CONDITION AND A BIT OVER PRICED. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A CHEAP, CONVIEINANT HOTEL FOR YOSHIS,THE FILMORE OR JAPAN TOWN. DONT EXPECT MUCH. THIS WILL WORK, BUT IF YOUR LOOKING FOR WHAT THEY ADVERTISE.

Within a 5 minute walk there is a large Japan-themed mall with much to do, see, buy and eat. This not your regular mall. The hotel staff recommended a number of places, all of which turned out great! It is about a 30 minute walk to Chinatown. The area also seemed very quiet and safe, so I was comfortable letting my teenagers wander around on their own a bit.\n\nThe hotel itself was very nice too. It has very fun, funky decor and the rooms are large, comfortable and clean. The hotel staff were all very helpful and accomodating. Even though we checked in a 2am (due a painful flight delay) the desk attendent took the time to give us a map of the environs, and circled places of interest to check out.

It's within good walking distance and you can have a little more peace of mind knowing your car is parked there, instead of on the street. The front desk was friendly. The internet access in the main lobby was convenient, although a little choppy. Typing was halting and uncomfortable, but still worked. I did not enjoy Mum's restaurant on the first floor. Service was slow with barely any customers. The hostess was friendly, but was too busy talking to a friend at the bar. Another customer interrupted her from across the room; because she began using foul language, or because he was having to wait indefinitely for his check. Either way, it wasn't good. It was obvious that she was not interested in being there; she left the restaurant at one point to do something else. If she wasn't intent on being professional, then I'm not inclined to go there again. There are MANY other nearby restaurants that are more cooperative. Ignore Mum's, but stay at the hotel. The guests loved slamming doors and smoking in a non-smoking hotel, but it did not destroy my experience.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Roseville, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-10-30T18:42:28Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"4","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_ca","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5901","reviewId":"20168306","photos":[],"itinId":"339703500","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"4105","userNickname":"Carie","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Cheap, comfortable, would definately go back","reviewText":"Hotel was clean and quiet.

There is a bus stop right outside which will take you straight to union square, or from fillmore you can start heading up the city. The bus service is amazing, not like the UK, so you can get anywhere you like pretty quickly.

These are perks that make a huge difference since many of the large hotels don't offer wi-fi and service is often patchy as well, even when you pay. The decor is fun and playful. This hotel would be a basic Best Western, but because it is decorated in such a trendy way it really gives the hotel lots of personality.

It's also in Japantown, with some great authentic Japanese restaurants. The hotel is essentially a motel but with amazing modern Japanese decor and a cool lobby. The rates were great, especially for the neighborhood. My only complaint is that housekeeping did not make up our room on either day we were there. The first day we were in and out of the room all day and they kept coming when we were in and then when we were finally out of the room for hours at a time, it was after 8:30. The second day they didn't come at all but by the time we figured it out, there was no point in asking them to come. I think they must have limited housekeeping hours. Also, their small parking garage was often filled by the end of the day when we returned to the hotel so we had to park on the street. It would have been nice if they had access to an offsite garage- they may have but they didn't tell us about it. No in-room coffee machine and no room service (but they have a menu in the rooms for a place that delivers).","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Maplewood, NJ","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-09-20T11:17:09Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5901","reviewId":"20168338","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Sylvia","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Clean, comfortable, and quiet","reviewText":"We were impressed with how clean this hotel was.

We liked being in Japantown, but to get on any buses we had to walk 2-3 blocks in any directions. Parking was very resonably priced. We thought the decor was fun - Japanese Pop Art.

From the first sight of the video screens and couch that looked like it was from under the sea in the lobby, the graphics on the ceilings, the mural and artwork in our room, the colors, to the hip wood furniture and Fatboy beanbag, we were smiling! The room size and layout is like any midpriced hotel we've ever stayed in, but the touches add a lot of fun and make it special. The lower floor rooms have a square bay window with a curtain that creates a delightful private space. We enjoyed breakfast at Mim's in the hotel, and had a late-night dessert there. We parked at the Japan Center garage two blocks away, and it turns out to be less expensive than parking at the hotel. It was affordable and out of the ordinary.

Located near most of the hustle and bustle of Japantown, it was close by to all the places I needed to get to for this trip. I had a corner room with a queen bed. Hotel room was okay as far as everything was concerned. The TV was flat screen, but we had trouble figuring out the remote for the TV because the sensor was hidden behind the television. The fridge in the room was not plugged in and had a bug in it. Although I did not get any, my traveling companion got some bug bites from staying in the room. The bathroom lighting was a little dim also. Showing was a little hard because of that. And all the soda machines were sold out on the three floors I tried to get drinks from. Despite all of that, the bed was extremely comfortable and I really liked the theme of the room. The iPod dock was a handy addition to the room. And that bean bag thing in the room (I think it's called a fatboy) was very comfortable to sit on. This was an okay place to stay. I have to admit I've stayed at better hotels in the area for the same price.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Los Angeles, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-06-30T17:38:23Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5901","reviewId":"20168434","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"William","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Reasonably priced hotel in a nice part of town","reviewText":"The Best Western Miyako is located in San Francisco's Japantown, a nice, quiet part of the city conveniently located for the economy traveler or tourist.

It was my job to arrange for the hotel and car. I have used Expedia on several occasions to book or reserve the things needed for my trips. I'm satisfied with Expedia but not with this Hotel at all. Although we were greeted in  a professional manner we soon learned of the problems with our rooms. The trim paneling for the door was missing on one side, a light bulb was burnt out and the room was dusty as soon by a large amount of dust which had accumulated around the vents. My friend who is elderly and disabled found very quickly that the main door lock to his room was malfunctioning. Upon calling the front desk they came up and had to toggle both the inner and outer handles to get the door to close. They didn't fix the problem only blamed it on a malfunction and showed my friend how to proceed from there on out. At 3:33 am the fire alarm went off due to a broken hot water line. We got no sleep so it didn't make for a very good day!

Quick, close, convenient to the airport for our late flight coming in and to catch an early flight out.  Free shuttle to airport international platform was just a very short walk to the BART, which we took down town daily.   Also just a short walk to IHOP and a couple restaurants as well as the bus line which also takes you right downtown, just a little longer than the BART.  For my first trip to S.F., these were helpful, yet you may want to study the connecting cable car, bus, and other routes prior to riding the bus to the Embarcadero to save time if you are going to Chinatown, or up over to the Golden Gate Park.  Felt more safe riding the BART and Bus downtown than I did riding the over crowded trolleys on the waterfront where my wife's wallet got jacked when the trolley became overcrowded in a surge.  Elevator in hotel was a little difficult to navigate at first since it was behind a door in the hallway.  Breakfast was plentiful for a continental style. Cereal, bagels, coffee, juice etc.  If you expect a big breakfast, go to IHOP.  Courtyard in back was relaxing.  Great Hotel for the price for travelers who know where they are going and just need a convenient crash pad while doing day tripping in San Francisco.

I was told that my room was one of the remodeled ones, but even so the bath tub drain was broken and the toilet needed repairs, and the furniture layout was so poor that there was no room to pull out the chair enough to sit at the desk without colliding with the bed. The desk was clearly a \"second\", and one of its drawers had been installed upside down! The only outlet away from the bathroom sink was overloaded with four appliances using what looked like a simple adapter covering the two actual outlets with four access points (rather than using a safer power strip).

Over the course of our stay they came before 10am on more than one occasion and on our last day when they should have waited for us to check out so that they could do a thorough clean, they tried to come in at 8.30am! I had to go down to reception more than once to ask for enough towels/handtowels/facecloths for the two people booked in the room as they usually only provided enough for one person.

They did have 1 waffle machine and coffee. They also had pastries but they usually were gone fast and they didn't replace them. I think they also had oatmeal packets and hot water for tea.\n\nAnother thing I noticed that there was only like 1 electrical outlet in the whole room.

The elevator is creepy and reminiscent of a horror movie. Given the welcome I'd received, I expected it to reek of urine, but it freshly scrubbed and borderline bleachy. The room itself was in need of renovation, but was exactly what I expected based on pictures and reviews I'd read. The bed was not comfortable, but I was only going to be there for approximately 12 hours, so I wasn't bothered. There were cigarette burns on the tub and the toilet was running when I arrived. Screaming children (there were many), I can forgive; screaming adults, are another story. The couple in the room next to me were in an all-out Jerry Springer-like shouting match. I imagined chairs being tipped over, shoes being thrown. Where was Steve to stop this insanity?? The argument went on in and out of the room for at least 40 minutes before management intervened.

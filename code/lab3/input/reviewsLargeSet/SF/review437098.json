We dropped the hire car back to the airport the day before and then used the free shuttle to go back to the hotel. We had earlier stopped and left our bags with the receptionist at the hotel. She could see that we were in a hurry and was very efficient with our bags. The room (including bathroom) was clean and very tidy, and nice and quiet. The breakfast starts at 6 am so we got up early and managed to have our breakfast before the 6.17 shuttle came to take us to the airport. Breakfast was of a good standard. I like that they have hot oatmeal (porridge), with various toppings - almonds and brown sugar. Also three or four different cereals, yogurt, fruit salad and hot dishes, toast and muffins and danish pastries. You can also make your own waffles. No restaurant on site but the receptionist suggested we try the hotel next door (Embassy Suites which is also a Hilton property). Lovely food and great service.

The queen beds are very comfortable. And we like the white comforters. The breakfast (included free) is very good. They even altered the menu slightly with different hot items during the 4 days. The hotel is close to SFO, but farther than Burlingame, and I hardly noticed any airplane or highway traffic noise.

The room should have been twice it's size and there really should be 2-3 waffle irons and 2-3 steam trays for the hot items. Lots of long lines, people waiting on the single waffle iron and refills for the steam tray. Staff was really hustling to keep up though.

I was pleased with the cleaniness of the room and good continental breakfast. Chlorine in the pool killed my bathing suit but I liked it anyway. The hotel also had a free parking and was convieniently located between San Francisco and the airport.

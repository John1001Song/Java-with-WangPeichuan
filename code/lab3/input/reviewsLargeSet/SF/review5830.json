There is no shuttle back to the airport until 6AM, so if your flight leaves early you have to take a cab as I did spending another $45!! The hotel is really nice. Friendly staff and has the French touch to it (Sofitel being French.) The water front is exotic with view of Oracle's HQ. The food was good.

Receptionist not knowledgeable regarding the free breakfast included in our stay. We registered for 2 adults and 2 kids, they only gave 2 breakfast vouchers. They were not sure if the age of the kids that eat free are 5 or 12 years old. I had to show my reservation email that I included the kids in it. So they asked the manager and we had to come back to the reception at a later date to get the additional vouchers. During the breakfast, the service for our drinks was so slow that we already ate half of our food, we still have no drinks. I had to remind the manager about it. Waiting for our bill took a long time also that we need to remind them twice. The room was very warm when we got in. I adjusted the thermostat and during night time, it was still very uncomfortable. When we called, since the engineers are out, they sent a very small desk fan. Very nice hotel and amenities. I liked the fact that the pool is only 3 and a half feet deep so I can just hang out by the poolside while my kids swim and not worry that they will drown since it is shallow. That is a very big plus for me and my family.

The hotel room is clean and the bed soft. Ahhhh! and then every time I fall asleep the air conditioning makes this huge noise as the vents contract. I try call downstairs and none of the buttons work. So up I get and go downstairs and they give me a new room, next to the service elevator and it reeks. So down I go again and say I will go back to my original room and they will send up an engineer.  The engineer arrives and he is a very nice man and I tell him to sit in the chair. At that point the showers from all around are going, the kids outside are screaming and he just looks at me in horror. I ask him to look at the phone, which he reprograms for me in 2 minutes. He calls for another room. We go to next room, walk in and there are no lights. He pulls the bed away and plugs in side light and says he will come back with a light bulb for the main light which he does. Finally 2 hours later I get to go to bed. Why is someone not checking your rooms.

The shuttle operates only once every hour and takes a maximum of 6 people. So if you happen to be the seventh person, you'll have to take a cab to the hotel (about $40) or Uber (about $25). This promise, to me, was a bit over the top. They promise complimentary trips and most of the time it may well work in your favour. It didn't always work in our favour and you have to be prepared to:\r\n\r\n1) Wait for an hour or more (if you miss the shuttle).\r\n2) Be among the first six or you're in trouble. \r\n3) Allocate a minimum of 20-30 minutes to get to and from the airport.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, the staff go out their way to make you feel welcome. We needed a late check out as our flight was extremely late. Granted it was a quiet weekend, but often staff can \"stick to rules\". The staff went out of their way to give us an extra late check out. And even around the bar and restaurant we had nothing but extremely professional service.\r\n\r\nThe rooms were spacious and the beds very comfortable.

My flight was late and after waiting for half-an-hour, I called the hotel.  Turns out the shuttle doesn't run from 11pm-6am.  So that was a $40 taxi ride to get to the hotel.  Then the next morning, it turns out the shuttle is one 6-person van and runs only once an hour!  The night before they had suggested I get there 10 minutes before it left to get a seat, but not true.  They have a list at the front to sign up on and I had to wait for the next shuttle, an hour later, because the 9am shuttle was full by 845am (and some of those passengers were holdovers from the 8am shuttle).

Didn't want to wait another hour, so they were nice enough to pay for a taxi but wouldn't pay the tip, so I guess transportation from airport isn't necessary free.

The decor of the Sofitel is beautiful and the room is comfortable and clean.  This hotel has a dysfunctional staff.  We chose to valet our car, as opposed to self park. But the valet guy said he was on break and I think our car sat outside the hotel all night because in the morning, it was not in the garage. It was sitting in the passenger drop off area.  This was the start of our problems.  We chose this hotel for the last night of our vacation because it is close to the airport.  My husband decided to take the car back to the rental company early in the morning and get to the airport ahead of us, via tram. The rest of us planned to take the hotel shuttle to the airport.  Only one thing, the hotel valet could not find our car keys.  After some time we became panicked, thinking that we would not be able to return the rental car and make our flight.  Finally, in desperation, I opened the valet's key cabinet and I found our car keys.  I went back to the room to pack and found they had locked me out.  I ran down to the front desk and one worker said to the other, \"Well that's because she checked out.\"  I explained that we had not checked out, my boys were still in their rooms, and I was not even packed yet.  Adding to the stress and madness, the shuttle was1/2 hour late because it was broken down.  We barely got to the airport in time for our flight and I cannot describe how stressful this was!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":1,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"The hotel is beautiful and comfortable.

This time was disappointing because there was a very loud party on the lobby and pool area from the time of check-in until 8:00 pm.  We had a prestige room and asked for the highest level available.  She gave us the 5th floor and said that was all she had.  The noise in the room was disturbing with a constant heavy base shaking the walls.  We called and asked for an option.  She said nothing was available unless we moved to a room without a water view.  She would not give us a rate discount on options she offered that were less expensive to begin with.  We went on Expedia and discovered they had water view presige rooms available still for that evening.  We called this person again and asked her what rooms were available.  After being very testy with her she finally confessed that there was the same room as ours available on the 8th floor but we'd need to wait for it to be cleaned.  This was about 5:00 pm well after check-in time.  I followed up with a staff person who let me in the room and said it was clean and available.  Didn't hear back from the front desk for an hour and had to demand to be moved.  Finally we got into the higher level room which was much quieter but after two hours of frustration.

This hotel is located near the bay overlooking a lagoon.  It is in a really nice, quiet location surrounded by office buildings including Oracle.  But, if you like to sleep in, it is near the San Carlos airport where small planes fly out at about 8am. It has easy access to the freeway and is conveniently located central to San Francisco and Palo Alto and is near the entrance to the San Mateo bridge for easy access to the east bay.  The hotel is very well appointed with modern decor and is very comfortable.  The unusual thing is that our room was not made every day we were there.  Of the 4 nights, it was only made twice.  We don't mind since we kept our sheets and towels to save on water and be green but this may bother some.  There was some confusion since I had added two days to our stay and so in effect had two reservations which seems to have confused the staff even though I had the two reservations linked.  Overall it didn't bother us too much but it would have been nice to have our beds made at the least.  The room was very clean though, especially the bathroom and we all loved the shower which was like a rainfall shower. We loved having a view of the lagoon.  The staff was very responsive especially when the toilet got clogged (water saving flush) which they fixed within 10 minutes of our request to fix it.

We did not eat at the restaurant, but the area looked very nice. On the one day we planned to eat breakfast there, the fire alarms went off and caused the evacuation of the entire building for about an hour, so our plans for that day were delayed. (BTW, we were impressed with how well THAT situation was handled. The staff was apologetic and friendly about the whole thing. Turns out a bride hung up her wedding dress on a sprinkler head in her room and caused them to go off on that entire wing. Bad news for the hotel...and for the bride.)\n\nOur view was great (5th floor facing the bay), and the decor was modern, clean and lovely. There is no fridge in the room, but there is a Keurig!

The hotel is easy to find, the employees (aside from the one exception) were friendly, professional and eager to help, and overall our stay was a pleasure. The rooms are comfortable and clean, great beds, lots of pillows, cozy little sitting area and clean, large bathroom. The restaurant looks lovely, and has live jazz (at least on the nights we stayed), and we would have loved to try it but the Valentine's prix fixe menu wasn't to our taste and was being served both nights we stayed, so we skipped it. Room service was delicious, with enough variety on the menu to accommodate many tastes, and attention to detail was fantastic. While the location might not be for everyone, it worked perfectly for us, and the convenience of the coffee shop/bakery in the lobby was nice too. One bummer, housekeeping didn't come to clean our room during our stay, we left the room at 11 and got back in the evening to find everything a mess.

Must be the French way.\nWe had a \"lagoon view\" room, with only a peek view if you stand at the far end of one window. There is no exhaust fan in the bathroom (I thought codes required either a fan or a window). There are comforters with duvets on the bed and no top sheet. Despite turning the thermostat way down, I was too hot with the comforter and too cold with nothing. And the soundproofing must be non-existent; I could hear door slams and conversations and toilets flushing at night. Needless to say, I would never stay there again unless they make some soundproofing renovations, put an exhaust fan in the bathroom, and a top sheet on the bed.

Next we go to get settled and realize that the room was in terrible disrepair: broken lamps shades, unsightly damage to the furnishings, filthy carpets and walls, and the TV remote control did not work. It actually looked like we were put in the room reserved for partying teenagers. I only hope not all the rooms are in such horrible condition.\n\nWe were simply too tired to trek down to the lobby and file a complaint so we went to bed early. Decent night's sleep and I'm happy to report that our biggest fear (bedbugs) was not realized.\n\nOverall - not what we expected from a luxury brand.

After the 15 minute promised time (actually I waited 20 minutes before calling) for the salad, I called down. They apologized and said it was on the way up and they'd comp it. 20 minutes later after I had fallen asleep the guy knocked on the door and I told him I didn't want it now, I was sleeping. He said it's complimentary, as if that would wake me up enough to stay up for a salad. I sent him back downstairs with the salad.\n\nNext day we called down to inquire about the shuttle to BART (really just the airport), one of the primary reasons we stayed there. The front desk said no problem it runs every hour. We went down and the driver berated us and said the shuttle only goes if someone needs to catch a flight. We successfully encouraged him to take us. When we arrived back at airport BART station and called for the shuttle the guy who answered the phone seemed less interested in picking us up after he found out we had gone into the city and hadn't just flown in.\n\nI will say there was one or two people who worked there who were super friendly, but between our bad experiences, wallpaper peeling off the wall (everywhere, not just the bathroom), desperate need of a paint job, dirty bathtub, and poor housekeeping, we won't ever visit another Sofitel.

We were there over the long memorial day weekend. It was such a very peaceful area surrounded by buildings trees, grass, a lagoon, and some wildlife (geese). It was humorous to see a geese crossing sign as you drive towards the hotel. There is free parking at the hotel and lots of it, a plus if you are driving long distance. The staff was very professional, polite, and helpful. There was a french doorman that had such a welcoming, friendly attitude as he greeted my family and me. The lobby itself is very clean it had this classy, modern, chic decor. The rooms and bathrooms are very clean they have a cleaning service each day to clean and replenish toiletries, water bottles, k cups for there Keurig coffee makers they have for each room. Amenities are great there is a jogging path near the pretty lagoon, a swimming pool, and a well kept top of the line gym that provided clean towels, fresh water, and fruit.

When we got to our room, the room was not clean. When we call the front desk, they told us that they knew about it and have alerted their cleaning staff. Why didn't they tell us when we were checking in? They expect us to wait in our room until their cleaing staff cleans our room past 10:00pm.

The style of the furnitures was totally different than the lobby. It's about early 90's style, but well-kept. I asked the front desk they said they did the remodeling for the lobby 2 years ago and are working on the rooms slowly.

We, along with our two daughters booked a double room with a view of the lagoon. The only drawback was the window did not open. The view was very nice. We loved the walking path that ran along the lagoon and even stopped to let our girls play in the playground nearby. We hoped for a jacuzzi but were satisfied to sit next to the pool for awhile before retiring to our room. Parking is free in a covered parking garage....big plus! The beds are small, but very comfortable, no complaints here. Room was very clean. Smelled smoke in the hallway near a couple of rooms, but thankfully it did not penetrate to our room. No in room coffee and the cafe downstairs had a huge line all morning. We decided to wait until we checked out to get breakfast nearby and have coffee then.

Stop by the Fox Theatre and the Little Fox bar for a great evening -- we are definitely going back.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"sacramento","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-07-13T18:18:54Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5830","reviewId":"19942887","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Denise","brandType":"Expedia","title":"comfort","reviewText":"The feather bed was comfortable, but too warm!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Mesa, AZ","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-06-01T23:14:37Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5830","reviewId":"19942885","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Frank","brandType":"Expedia","title":"So-So Sofitel","reviewText":"ALthough the staff was very courteous and helpful, I would not stay here again. Where many of the chain motels offer free internet service to their guests, Sofitel charges a $5 connection fee(connecting their computer to the internet) and a dollar a minute thereafter. Cheap. Also, the room we stayed in didn't have a bathroom fan, a balcony or a window that could be opened for fresh air. The service in the restaurant for lunch was poor. The hotel and rooms are clean and well-decorated, with nice toiletries. The concierge and doormen are exceedingly polite, as are all the personnel.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"San Luis Obispo","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-06-01T03:24:30Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5830","reviewId":"19942886","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Gloria","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Could service more actively","reviewText":"This was our first time travel with our 11 months old baby. As first time parents we were unexperienced about traveling with baby. When we checked in they saw our baby with us but didn't ask us if we need any baby equipment such as crib or changing table (those are available in the hotel).We assumed that we would have to let the baby co-sleep with us. Thankfully my sister came to visit us and told us the that we could ask for a crib. The service could be more senstive and actively especially for parents with babies.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":2,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-06-01T03:01:03Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5830","reviewId":"19942998","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Erika","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Well worth it - if you don't mind a 30 minute drive into the city","reviewText":"Very nice view of the lagoon, great customer service, free & ample parking, close to the airport, great penninsula access.

Service was friendly, and even though I waited about 5 minutes to be checked in since the receptionist was on the phone she gave me complimentary drink tickets for the bar which was nice. The rooms were very comfortable, a down comforter which gets the duvet replaced daily, and and overall luxurious bed. Nice bathroom and amenities. However, for being located in Silicon Valley, the heart of the technology world you would think they would have Internet Service for free. It costs $9.95 to have it in you room - pretty crazy since the hotel is located in a major business district and Oracle being right down the street. Overall, a nice place to stay though.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Monterey, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-05-18T06:59:30Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]}]}}}

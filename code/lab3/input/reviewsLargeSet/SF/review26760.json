The bed was so comfortable and the pillows were quality. The bathroom was clean and well appointed and also pretty large for a hotel room. People that have stayed in hotels in London, Paris or NY would be so surprised by how much space they get for such a reasonable price. \r\n\r\nI want to call out the concierge service and specifically Jeff. I had been out walking around the neighborhood and stopped and bought a six pack of bottled beer to enjoy while watching my World Champion Warriors win yet another game and tie the record for all time NBA wins in a season. I assumed there would be a bottle opener in the room, but there was not. I quickly went to the concierge desk and asked if they had one so I wouldn't have to go searching the neighborhood and missing some of the Warriors game.

So we quickly logged online thru Hotels.com and booked another room for the remainder of the trip. Since we were walking while making the reservation for the extra room on our iPhone we accidently booked an extra night then needed. 2 minutes after hitting submit, I called Hotels.com to cancel that extra night and was told that it was possible but they just needed an \"okay\" from the Westin's manager.

As soon as we walked into our rooms we knew we had made a terrible mistake. The rooms are outdated, musty, dirty, smelly, and small. We had rooms in both the landmark building and the so-called modern tower building. Their idea of modern is late 80's. Both set of rooms were incredibly disappointing. Even though we knew that staying right in union sq. would be touristy, this hotel has hundreds of people walking in the lobby, a Starbucks-type coffee shop that also serves as their lobby bar (?) and with very few seats for that matter. Its like staying in TIMES SQUARE rather that Union Sq. If you like that sort of thing go for it, otherwise avoid at all cost!!! On the positive side, it is centrally located, the staff is courteous and willing to help, and there are plenty of transportation options available in the property. The concierge was helpful arranging private transportation, giving directions, but they will unmistakably direct you to the classic \"tourist trap\" restaurants with bad food that you would expect from a hotel like this. Do not follow the concierge recommendations for restaurants if you are a discerning diner.

And I love that it's classic and survived the huge earthquake and fire. But the rooms were underwhelming and it seems like they were cut in half. I booked a king bedroom. But since we did not arrive until the evening as that's when we got into SF, they gave away our room. Not sure if the king room is bigger but we ended up with what felt like a full size bed (albeit comfortable) in a room just a few feet bigger than the bed. The hotel did give us a $70 credit to be used in hotel, which helped. The windows were small and did not let in natural light. The bathroom was cold and the sink never gave us hot or warm water. But shower did. Strange. The TV should have been across from the bed rather than on one side. The back half of hotel with the fun elevators does not have the classic look from the outside. Not sure why as it appears disjointed. We had breakfast in the hotel and it was $85 for two (overpriced for what we ate). We also hung out at the Clock Bar and that was okay. Server was friendly.

We booked our rooms (3 couples..) about 8 months ago, as we had a family wedding their. No problem they told us. They have no hotel shuttle from the airport. We booked everything together, and everyone was on a different floor, not even close to each other. The rooms were very small, our room the safe, and the phone did not work. We reported this to the maid, since we couldn't use the phone, nothing was ever done about either. No fans in the bathroom after a steamy shower. 1 of the rooms had the robes that it promised in the description, and the other room, the iron didn't work. Also no wi fi unless you bought it for $15 a day. I know this sounds petty in the big circle of life, but when you have paid for a wedding their, and many family/friends staying their..it should be more than average.

There were also long queues on check in and check out due to a staff shortage, which I found quite irritating. If you have a SPG loyalty card you'll find that unless you're gold or above there's no dedicated line.\n\nStaff were okay. Concierge were particularly helpful, giving me a map and directions to local cinemas and a book store. The reception staff varied, with one member being a little passive aggressive that I wasn't clear on their green programme and what it meant (which I have a whole separate rant about).\n\nWorst part of the stay was the room. It was in an older part of the hotel and I picked up every noise from the hallway and the room next door, which kept me awake - had I been there for more than 2 nights, I'd have asked to move. The toilet also gurgled at odd intervals. The room itself was on the smallish side but that isn't an issue for me and I found the bed comfortable.\n\nI did get contacted by the hotel afterwards apologising for the noise issue and making a note for future stays, which I appreciated and thought was good customer service.

The carpet on the room was kind of old and dirty.\nThe worse part was the bathroom. The tub was too small and narrow and when you closed the shower curtain and start to shower, the curtain moves toward you and gets attached to your wet body and makes difficult to shower. My wife is petite and had the same problem. We try to close the bathroom door to avoid any type of air draft, but it did not help. The water did not get hot enough, even after turning the water all the way to \"hot\". Next to the bathroom sink that was a small wood panel that gives access to the pipes and it almost fell on my wife's feet without us touching it. I had to put it back.\nAll through the night we could hear door slamming because the room doors have a door closer at the top that are too strong, so anytime someone come in or out of their room, it would make a loud bang. As we moved from our room to the elevator we could hear people in their rooms, so the doors and walls do not give any privacy and makes at night you can hear other rooms TVs and conversations.\nWe did not complain to the hotel because we had a very packed schedule and did not have much time in between the things we had to do, places to go and the times we spent at the hotel.\nIt was very disappointing, specially for a hotel with such good reviews and high price.

Our experience living at St. Francis was not really luxurious as we expected it to be. There were no glasses to drink water in or a jug to store water, there were just 2 paper cups to drink water from which were actually meant for coffee. Throughout our stay we felt more inconvenient because basic things like glasses were not available, then the shower would not get hot enough, the wash basin had gunk stuck in it and whenever we turned the tap on the whole sink started to get filled and almost overflowed. These look like minor things but made us feel inconvenient. Our stay at less luxurious and cheaper hotels has been way better compared to St. Francis.

These hotels are just a short distance apart in San Francisco city centre.\n\nBeing part of the same group the overall facilities at each hotel were similar. The Westin St Francis on Union Square was larger, and the staff there were significantly less courteous and friendly than those in the Westin San Francisco at Market Street, (who were as helpul, friendly and courteous as anyone could wish for).\n\nI was in the original building at the Westin St Francis (they have a newer tower). The decor in the corridor areas was a bit tired, but the room was OK You can see the grandeur that that must have been there 40 years ago. The hotel is in a great location, and is ideal for both tourist and business travellers. However, it was the service and demeanour of the staff that was the main disappointment, on two separate occasions I was shocked by how abruptly I was spoken to when asking for assistance or information. (...that and and the remnants of nearby rooms' room-service meals that seemed to always lay in the corridors.)\n\nAt the Westin San Francisco, just a few blocks away, I was treated like a friend rather than a \"money generator\". As a business traveller who spends a lot of time in hotels, it is the small things that make a big difference.

I arrived at the hotel rather early in the morning, so my room was not yet ready. The front desk person indicated that I could check my luggage with the bell captian and that he would call me when the room was ready. Since I wanted to do some sight seeing, this was fine with me. However, I was never called. I did not know that my room was ready until I returned to the hotel, late in the afternoon. The person who was on duty, when I returned to the hotel, profusely apologized for the oversight. This was the only negative thing which occurred during my stay.\n\nThe room was large and very nicely decorated with what appeared to be fairly new furnishings.

One thing I would recommend if you are going to rent a car is walking two blocks to the Hertz office instead of renting from the Hertz desk inside the hotel - the rate was almost half price and it's very close to the hotel. Also, room service is quite expensive but that was to be expected. Overall a great place to stay within blocks of great shopping at Union Square and right on the trolley line!","featured":true,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Seattle, WA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-03-10T17:42:16Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"26760","reviewId":"18364064","photos":[],"itinId":"300660039","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Tracey","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Will be returning next Spring!","reviewText":"The staff were all extremely helpful, the location was excellent in Union Square, the room was great.

The shopping is wonderful on the square, with all of the large department stores there. If you want to buy groceries, there is a good supermarket in the Westfield shopping mall about a block away; Borders and Walgreens close by. The information centre is also about a block away.

We were celebrating our 5th wedding anniversary. We chose the St. Francis for many reasons. Its reputation as being a San Francisco icon was a major reason. The place is filled with history. We were not disappointed. From the minute we checked in to the minute we checked out, we were treated like special guests. The rooms were five-star, the view breathtaking and the experience one we would definitely like to have again. Also, the Concierge was extremely helpful, friendly and dead-spot on in their recommendations. If there is one negative, it would be the costs that are associated with so many amenities that used to be complimentary to hotel guests. The charge for hotel parking was staggering. But, the St. Francis is not the Lone Ranger in this department. Parking in San Francisco is extremely expensive. But, there are garages a couple of blocks away that were less expensive. We saved a lot of money by parking off site. We absolutely loved our stay at the St. Francis. I do recommend to anyone who is looking to stay here to request a room in the Tower. The ride in the glass elevator never got old. What a view. Stay at the St. Francis.

It's definitely better if you're not a zillionaire to visit San Francisco occasionally and stay high up in a reasonably priced hotel such as the St. Francis so you can look down at the city from above. If you're a local, you'll typically always be down on the street looking up, wondering what the zillionaires and tourists are doing. If you aren't familiar with San Francisco, you may think you're in Calcutta with all the panhandlers and scary people. Face it, contrary to how it may seem the St. Francis is in a GOOD neighborhood. That's why you get the most persuasive and convincingly desperate professional panhandlers and shysters hassling you. Consider yourself fortunate not to have booked a hotel in the Mission, SOMA or Tenderloin where the desperate looking souls are truly desperate and your safety is really an open question.

It had no class. It was a roadside motel masquerading as a 4-star hotel. The reason to stay at a nicer hotel is for the amenities. This hotel had none. Listen to this, without exaggeration: * Parking was $49 a day. * Internet was $15 a day. That was for slow internet. If you wanted fast internet, it was $20 a day. (I'm not joking. They really did charge $20 a day for \"fast\" internet.) * I didn't get new soap every day. The maids would judge for themselves whether it seemed like I had enough soap left for a shower the next morning. One night I had to call the front desk to request more be brought up. I expected to get a handful--soap, shampoo, conditioner, so I was sure to be satisfied. Nope. The bellboy arrived with a single new bar of plain soap, not even the \"designer\" soap, since this one was extra. * The \"Business Center\" $10 for 10 minutes on the internet. That's after already spending $15 a day in my room. And $1.50 per black and white copy. I've never been in a hotel before that charged for using the printer. I had to keep my credit card with me at all times in case I was going to be charged for something else. * Here's the coup de grace. The room had a minibar. It had some kind of system in it that monitored if you ever moved a bottle. I like to buy soda and store it in my room for convenience. I was charged $175 over 5 days for simply rearranging the bottles in the minibar to leave room for my own bottle of soda.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":1,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Philadelphia","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-09-09T13:09:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"26760","reviewId":"18363926","photos":[],"itinId":"287698930","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Peggy","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Fitness Center Fees","reviewText":"We were very pleased with our overall stay.

The shower curtain had mould on the corner, and there was more mould under the rim of the hand basin where the seal had fallen away. Biggest concern was on our day of departure. We left our luggage at the hotel in good faith, for safe-keeping until our departure for the airport. Our luggage was not kept in a locked room. I went to retrieve some travel documents mid-afternoon and found our luggage left by itself, on a trolley in the undercroft garage driveway, where anyone could have access. We were fortunate nothing had been stolen. We expressed our concerns to the hotel staff and were not given a satisfactory response. They merely said they had never had any problems before ... but that doesn't mean they won't have any problems in the future. In this day and age of high security, we thought this was very poor practice indeed. Paid for 24 hours internet access, but this was automatically terminated on checkout at 11.00 a.m. so I was unable to use wifi in the hotel lobby during the afternoon. Big thumbs down for this hotel.

One of my business colleagues even suggested the room was haunted. It was at the end of a long hallway (the only room at this end, next to the stairs) and I really think it was located in a place where the hotel service staff just \"forgot\" about it. When I entered my room, the window was open, the TV was on, and there was a duvet cover wrapped up in plastic sitting on top of the bed. There was a bolster/pillow next to it (in the middle of the bed). So it's like housekeeping got 3/4 of the way through cleaning the room and then left? Strange. The front desk wasn't quite sure about it either, but offered to move me to another room. I declined since it was late and I was going to bed. I hung my breakfast order on the card outside the door at about 10pm. The next morning, the card had not been picked up. (But I did have a newspaper...) I called roomservice and they apologized and got me my order very quickly, which was really appreciated. My review would definitely be worse if the front desk and roomservice had not been so apologetic and willing to fix the problems in a hurry. So a huge plus goes to those folks who know how to fix issues quickly!

They were pleasant, accomodating, and helpful; however, the service from the restaurant in the lobby as well as the concierge was not impressive. The complimentary pretzels they served were stale!!!

The towels for the bathroom are old, and rough, from too many washes and high heat drying. The bath towel is also not much larger than the hand towels. The hotel, like all upscale hotels nickels and dimes you for everything including $12/day for use of the gym. I didn't think the hotel had much character past the exterior and some trim work in the rooms and hallways. The staff are extremely nice and the service is impeccable. However, having lived in San Francisco, we only used the hotel as a place to sleep and a base to jump from. For the money, it's a bit expensive for what you get, but you are paying for location too. It's a fine hotel if you are used to staying in lower end hotels, but doesn't compare to the newness of a Crowne Plaza or say the Omni. And it's no where near the Mandarin Orientals or Intercontinental out there.

The best part was the attentive and knowledgeable concierge, especially this one gentleman, whose name I can't recall--a soft-spoken, caucasian man with glasses--anyway, I gave him a list of 5 or 6 places that I wanted to visit in one day and he basically mapped out my entire route, complete with buses I needed to take and strategic ways to get from A to B in the least amount of time. He really impressed me and made my time at this hotel that much more delightful. The rooms are spacious and ultra clean... there is peace and quiet to be had and though the views weren't the best--most likely due to the low fog obstructing our view of the Golden Gate Bridge--it was a still a top notch hotel experience.

This also made it extremely quiet, and with no sun or sounds to wake up to, it was very restful.\n\nRoom service menu was nice and what I ordered was relatively good.  Caesar salad was quite nice, but the shrimp cocktail was not fresh.\n\nThis location is excellent. There is nothing like waking up, walking downstairs, and stepping onto the streets of downtown San Francisco early on a crisp morning.  Grab a latte and watch the flower vendors setting up around Union Square. \n\nI was within four blocks of work in the financial district and a block away from all the shopping I could want.  The hotel even gave us a 12% discount at the nearby Macy's.\n\nThe staff was very courteous and it was a very nice 'getaway.'  \n\nI highly recommend this hotel, a reasonable rate and better service and location than many of the B&B's I have seen in the Union Square area.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"El Cerrito, California","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-01-14T21:24:10Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"26760","reviewId":"18364010","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Luis","brandType":"Expedia","title":"San Francisco's traditional jewel","reviewText":"The Hotel location, facilities and personnel were just extraordinary.

The cable Car stop is in front of the hotel, jump on at Powell and Post and avoid the huge queue at the base of Powell St.  The Hyde St. or Mason St. line will take you to Fisherman's Wharf, the Hyde St. line provides you with the postcard views of Telegraph Hill and then Alcatraz as you descend to the Wharf.\n\nStaff was very accomodating at check in and friendly, despite comments to the contrary.  It helps to be as pleasant as you can be yourself, not easy after a cross country flight.  \n\nThe St. Francis has ruined their lobby area, formerly known as the Compass Rose.  The space has been leased to a restaurant and what had been a very confortable place to lounge and drink has now been reduced to a pitiably small area right off the Powell entrance. It used to be a terrific spot.\n\nOur room was good, bed was very comfortable (marketed as heavenly beds), and we had a nice sitting area as well.  The bathrooms are ready for a full makeover, at least ours was.  The hallways, we were in the newer tower, are also kind of dreary.  \n\nSt. Francis is tough to beat, however, for location, location, location.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Chicago","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-01-13T17:03:58Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"26760","reviewId":"18364036","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Tanci","brandType":"Expedia","title":"great staff","reviewText":"All staff very well trained and everything was fast!!!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Sacramento CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2004-12-21T16:27:58Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"26760","reviewId":"18364041","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Perry","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Historic Hotel offers great location","reviewText":"We did not stay in the towers, so our room was very small yet comfortable.

Check in was a breeze and they were able to accommodate my request for a high floor. They did put an almost $90.00 authorization on my card which I am patiently waiting 5 business days for. The elevators were a bit shaky but you have to remember the hotel was built 100 years ago. The lobby and hallways seemed to be kept very clean which helps appreciate the history of the building. We stayed in a deluxe queen room which seemed to be a fair size for two people in San Francisco. Besides the old sushi we found in the mini-fridge from a previous guest, the room was spotless. The furniture was old and was in need of some updating. The armoire could use some love as the doors needed to be slammed to stay closed. We were woken up by a neighbor and their family that kept slamming the doors in their room for about half an hour straight one morning. Can't blame them as the doors need to be closed to get from one side of the room to the other. The queen bed needs to be replaced. The springs poke through, the mattress sags and has uneven support. You don't exactly feel rested when you wake up. Going along with the history of the hotel is the plumbing. The pipes seemed to cry and moan when someone used their shower or sink. If you have never stayed in a busy city before, be ready for late night sirens and pointless arguments in the street.

The next street over was a Walgreen good for midnight runs and two blocks to Union Square.\n\nWhen we checked in we were given a free upgrade to a suite because of my birthday & the receptionist, Claire was super friendly and helpful. Another receptionist was also helpful one time in referring us where to go to get somethings when Walgreen nearby was close but I don't remember her name.\n\nWhen we were given the keys to our room I was a bit surprised that it was an actual big key rather than the cards I was so used to from other hotels. Our room was on the seventh floor right near the elevator so it was convenient. The door was quiet heavy in my opinion and when we opened the door and walked it I couldn't help but be super sensitive to the odor. It had an old antique odor but I got used to it. A few thing I have to complain about the room was one of the dresser, the door would only open by force and hence when you closed it it made a noise and took force too. The TV was ancient, the old small fat ones. The sofa was old. The only thing that looked nice was the bed & frame and the bathroom.

I was however very pleased with my stay. The room we stayed in was clean and certainly adequate size-wise for two people. I read that the rooms were small, but I suppose we got one of the bigger rooms. I was also geared-up for lots of street noise (as recorded in some reviews) and the possibility of not being able to sleep at nights because of the noise volume. Well, that was not the case whatsoever. We had a room facing Geary Street and it was very quiet after dark.\n\nThe hotel served the purpose of a place to sleep for the two nights we were in San Franciso. If you're looking for amenities (such as swimming pool, hot tub, etc.) this is not the place for you to stay. If you are looking for a decent night's rest and a central place to stay then I would recommend this hotel.\n\nThe hotel is conveniently located in Union Square. We were able to save money on snacks and breakfast by purchasing food items from the Walgreen store located across the street from the hotel. We didn't eat at the hotel's restaurant - it was overpriced.\n\nThe hotel staff were very helpful and pleasant.

Conflicting fading floral patterns on the walls, curtains and other soft furnishings are an eyesore (in the suite we got anyway).

I also felt he was dismissive and discourteous regarding my questions on parking (it was valet or \"I don't know anything about any other parking stations around here\" - fair enough you want people to use your service, but you can lose the tone!!!). We had to cart our own bags up using the hotel trolley (4 large suitcases) and then found there were stairs going down to our room so we had to haul them in after a long and tiring plane trip).

Surprisingly, I found all these, and more while staying at the Warwick. I got a great deal on Expedia on the hotel. It is two blocks down from Union Square, two blocks down to Market Street. It is by shopping, art galleries, and theaters. It was fun leaving our hotel to walk to other desinations. It is four blocks to the BART, close to bus and cable car lines, and across the street from a Walgreens. There were places to eat around the hotel. The area around the hotel felt safe because there were lots of people out at night. When it got dark, however, there were homeless people going through garbage cans, even with all the other tourists there. The room was small, but functional, comfortable and attractive. You could hear other people talking sometimes, and turning on their water faucets; but it wasn't too disturbing. Everything was very clean.\nI mentioned, when I made the reservation, that it was our anniversary. When we arrived, there were fresh chocolate dipped strawberries with a chocolate creme and a bottle of wine. I mentioned at the desk that we didn't drink and they bought and delivered to our room some Martinelli's by the time we next came back to our room. Nice touch. My vote for the warwick?

Lots of stores and restaurants in the surrounding area.\n\nIt is an older building that has been well-renovated. I was surprised at how well the windows muffled the street noise when closed (fourth floor). I didn't mind not having air conditioning, despite being in San Francisco on one of the hottest days of the year.\n\nI loved the antique furniture in my room, and throughout the common areas of the hotel. The bed was very comfortable.\n\nIt was a treat for me to have my luggage carried to my room by a porter, and placed on a suitcase table for my convenience. Bath towels were missing from my room when I checked in, but they were speedily delivered by the porter once I notified the front desk. Breakfast room service was delivered on time, although my main dish had been missed on the order form.

You then have to call the hotel for a pickup at one of the 4 terminals so this could be up to another 3 or 4 more stops depending on what terminal you pick up the shuttle from. This is kind of annoying but it gets worse. The Shuttle then stops at numerous hotels along the way and at each hotel the shuttle bus brings individuals to their individual rooms so there are added stops and delays to ultimately get you to the La Quninta hotel. So with all of this stopping what is approximately a 5-7 minute ride by taxi may take up to an hour and half plus by free shuttle. Ouch!

She also gave us the parking permit so we could use their underground parking (free).\n\nThe park spaces are good and it was easy to maneuver our car (an SUV).\n\nThe room was very clean and even the carpet seemed well maintained. The shower and water pressure was good. The only complain is the ac. It is a little loud and it is hard to find the right adjustment (for heating).\n\nThe breakfast is good considering the price. It has some hot items and a waffle machine. Yogurt, bananas and different types of pastry are also available.\n\nThe Wi-Fi speed is average. We could work OK but we've seen better speeds on other hotels.\n\nDrive to San Francisco is easy but it can take from 25 to 40 depending on traffic.\n\nPricewise I would say: it is OK.

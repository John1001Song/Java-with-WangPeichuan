The sink area was clean and fairly modern. The toilet / shower room was clean as well and even has a window up in the ceiling to let light in. \r\nThe motel is old, I believe 3 stories high (The lower story being parking) and is well maintained. The neighborhood was what could be expected for downtown San Francisco. A decent continental breakfast was served (and much appreciated!) That included packaged pastries, fresh fruit, small yogurt cups and refrigerated fruit juice.\r\nAlthough I was not cold, my only complaint is that there is no bed spread, just sheets and blanket. Also the weather stripping could use some refreshing.

We needed a cheap motel that was not a dump or in a dangerous area of town.

No shuttle was available, so we walked to the BART station 6 blocks away to travel to the airport.\r\nThere is no elevator, so it is not handicapped accessible.

The afternoon employee, Jennifer, was super friendly and welcoming, and the room was really cute - not huge, but perfect for a weekend away. Clean, free wifi, decent sized bathroom, and a fridge.\n\nThings got a little dicey the next morning, however. After not sleeping great, I phoned the front desk to ask for more pillows and another blanket, and figured I'd get some extra towels as well. The day manager gave me the fifth degree about the request, including some confusion about whether I wanted the amenities delivered immediately or done when housekeeping came to clean. Eventually everything arrived, but when I traded in my dirty towels I was told I'd be charged ($10!) for a soiled washcloth. If I had known there was a charge for getting the linens dirty, I'd have brought my own! We later worked it out and ultimately weren't charged, but were told that since the hotel is \"in transition\" they are very low on linens. There also was construction going on - including on Sunday morning - that was more than a little annoying.\n\nOverall, I'm an optimist, so I'd recommend this location with a \"5 star\" rating with the hope that the customer service snafus will be remedied once the \"transition\" is over.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"Location, afternoon staff, room comfort and cleanliness.","negativeRemarks":"Day manager - was nice the second day, but this could be more consistent.

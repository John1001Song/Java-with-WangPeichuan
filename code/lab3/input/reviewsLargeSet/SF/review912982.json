However, we were given room 1105 which had easy access to the sun deck off the 11th floor.\r\nOur room was fitted out with a kitchenette including stove, microwave, mini fridge and coffee maker.

The staff were very friendly from the moment we got in. We had the option to upgrade for an extra $25 but decided against it. We had a room facing Clay St. looking out into the street and right across from Le Meridian. It was perfect except for the couple hours protesters would come out and chant about Le Meridian. It fit us two perfectly. Enough space to get ready, get on the computer, watch TV and sleep. There is a sundeck on the 11th floor that we took advantage of every night where we would go look out into the city and have a couple glasses of wine. Location was perfect.

The staff was pleasent and lobby/lounge were done up nice for the holidays.   Coffee machine is great.  I checked into a basic room with no view, so I went back down and did a suite upgrade, which was much nicer, it was on the 10th floor and had a tub instead of just shower and also a living room with couch bed and tv, but best was a great view of the Marina and even a little Bay Bridge and San Francisco pier/ skyline action.  The 11th floor had a beautiful view similar to the room but included a hovering view of the Transamerica pyramid, I suggest having a picnic or glass of wine up at the tables there.  My girlfriend and I then walked 5minutes up Clay St right into Chinatown on Xmas day and had a really great experience.  We went back that night and the next day.  At night we hopped in the car and drove like 2mins to Marina blvd for a nice 20 min drive over to Golden Gate & Sausalito to do the Xmas light thing/ bay viewing.  I did get a ticket for $66 for parking in front of Club Quarters on Xmas, the sign says no Parking on Mon Wed or Fri from 2am-6pm and I misread, because that means you cant park on Sun, Tue or Thursday night of your stay since those listed are early hours of your peaceful sleep.

No tub.\nHousekeeping missed a few spots. But in general, hotel in good shape. They have\"self check-in\" which lacks any warmth, but it's good for business travelers. They offer a nice seating area in lobby with coffee service to include cappucinos! The location is the best! near all lines of transportation, restaurants, embarcadero's Ferry Bldg. and a quick walk to the wharf.\n\nI received a good deal, so felt it was worth it. The staff informed me that they will be renovating some of the rooms to be more \"warm\" which will be nice. I'll stay again if rates are comparable to others, as now it's a known quantity.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"location","negativeRemarks":"need a housekeeping manager to double check rooms not cleaned well.","locationRemarks":"Best location - near Embarcadero/Ferry Bldg., all bus/muni/bart lines.

However, it suddenly dropped to $119 so I quickly took advantage of it. Score!!!!\n\nWell all know, driving through the streets of SF is crazy. Locating your hotel at night that does not have a visible sign makes it even worse. After driving in circles, we finally found the property. We self-parked at the Embarcadero Center; quite convenient as it is a 4-5 minute walk to the hotel. Check-in via the self-service kiosk was hassle free and quick. It took less than 1 minute to receive my room key.\n\nThe room size was relatively small, but that was expected. It was clean and modern.\n\nWhen we got back to the hotel about 3am, all we wanted to do was sleep. Well, as we turned around to kiss each other, we felt a pronounced bump/divider in the middle of the bed. Yes, we were sleeping on 2 beds pressed together. Say what?!?! I know. Shook head in disbelief. I purchased a room with a queen size bed. Furthermore, Expedia's site specified queen bed in the hotel details. Since we were tired and intoxicated, we shrugged it off and slept.\n\nLater that day it was bothering me so I called the hotel and expressed my concern. Surprisingly, the female front desk saw nothing wrong. She did not apologize and replied with a generic answer. Who in their right mind would think 2 twin size beds pushed together equates to a queen bed? Really?\n\nDeceptive business practice? Perhaps.

The Front Desk staff were very helpful in booking tours, upgrading accommodations and parking. NOTE: Hotels in the financial district of San Francisco do not have their own underground parking, therefore you will have to pay for overnight parking in a parking structure close to the Hotel. One nice feature is the English Pub and Restaurant at the Hotel. We enjoyed the food there and I particularly liked the Chicken Wrap in the Balsamic Glaze. It was very good. Another nice feature was the Hop-On/ Hop-Off sightseeing tour bus that stops across the street from the Hotel. It takes you to all the historic and popular sites of San Francisco. NOTE: If you would like to see Alcatraz, either book it in advance or see about getting tickets from one of the sightseeing tour companies as a package.

It's also in a great location - something I was particularly interested in - walking distance from Chinatown and a cable car line.

The front desk advised us about a parking garage nearby that charged $32 for a 24-hour stay, or $41 for in/out access. The hotel itself is gorgeous and a great location-- right next door to the Elephant and Castle (great pub food), one block from the Punchline Comedy Club and the Embarcadero Center (with theater and shopping), a short distance from Pier 1/Embarcadero, and very close to Columbus and the start of the North Beach area as well. The hotel elevators require you to swipe your room card to activate the elevator, which we thought was a great security feature. We were on the third floor, with our wall adjacent to an alley, and despite the busy location we heard absolutely zero exterior noise and slept quite well. Check-out was at noon and was easy as can be. We would definitely return and would recommend Club Quarters to friends/family in a heartbeat.\n\nCons: There were a few stains on the carpet, plus a very small tear in the bedsheet, but those are completely minor issues.

The bathroom is not much better with the sink taking up most of the space, leaving a very small amount of space for the toilet and shower (there was no bathtub in this room). While there is a television, it was a small one being about the same size as my computer monitor. Furthermore, the one time I ordered from room service it not only took over an hour for me to receive my meal, but it was cold and no silverware was provided meaning I had to go down to the restaurant to get a knife and fork (which defeats the purpose of the room service).\n\nOn the plus side: It's location is great being only a couple of blocks from both Market Street and the Embarcadero. Free bottled water was a huge benefit given the heat conditions of San Francisco. For those with wireless internet, free WiFi was provided. There was a free laundry room and gym available.\n\nIn all, this is probably a good place for individuals who plan to spend absolutely no time in their room. If, on the other hand, a room where one could lounge around before heading out in the morning or relax in the evening, or a room better fitted to a couple or family, there are probably much better (and cheaper) options.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Bremerton, WA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-07-14T08:00:12Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"912982","reviewId":"18372650","photos":[],"itinId":"328641143","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Evelyn","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Good value","reviewText":"The location is really good, very central, and the hotel is a great value for the location.

This hotel is pretty much bare bones. If you are USED to the amenities of a larger hotel chain, you will be surprised as to the difference of this hotel. Firstly, their so-called high-speed internet connection was slow, and did not connect half of the time. Secondly, if you are sharing a hotel with your mate or work college, be informed that all (i was told by the front desk) of the bathroom doors have no-locks as well as a 1\" open gap on both sides of the door. So, anyone can see right in as you're doing your business. The elevators have a magnetic card that rarely works. I had to use only one eleveator when I was there because I knew that was the only elevator my swipe-card worked in. Finally, when I called the hotel before I checked in, they said the bed I would have was a king bed. In fact, the bed was a Double-Bed, not a queen. On the plus side, though, this hotel is in the middle of the financial district, close to everything in that district. Also, there's an \"Elephant and Castle\" restaurant and a Starbucks in the same building. However, there's no mini-bar or fridge, even though they said that all rooms have a \"kitchenette\". Also, the hotel was very quiet. But, the room was very small.

One, the bathroom door uses catches to close leaving a small gap that affected privacy. It was also loud. Of course, this wouldn't be an issue for one traveling alone. Second, our room didn't have a tub. Since we rented bicycles and rode across the Golden Gate Bridge, this was one occasion that I would have loved to soak in a tub when we got back.

As a note, they provide everything you need (i.e. plates, glasses, silverware, pots, pans, mixing bowls, cutting knives) in case you want to cook in the kitchen. I loved it here and would recommend it to anyone. Only drawback is there is no ice machine, only a filtered water dispenser in the hallway. I would come prepared with your own beverages to place in the fridge. That's it...my only complaint! As a side note, I relied on other reviews regarding parking...please realize parking on the street is EXTREMELY difficult to find (not sure if it was because it was summertime or what) so be prepared to pay for parking. Most in the area are $38 a night. We purchased tickets for an open top bus tour that were good for 2 days (you can find these types of tours originating in Union Square) and didnt need our car. The cost ranges from $25-$32 per adult and in my opinion it is well worth it. Especially if you find one that will take you on a full loop for one price. I dont remember the name of the company, but the buses have an American Flag on the side of the bus.

The check-in desk staff were very pleasant. If you prepay (eg. via Expedia) beforehand then the process is a little different in that there are machines almost like ATMs in the check-in lobby that take your credit card and issue you your room key. The staff were helpful in assisting new guests like ourselves. We had read that the 'inner' rooms, i.e. those facing away from Clay St are quieter, and although we didn't check an outer-facing room, our inner room was very quiet, unusual for a San Francisco hotel room where I usually get woken up by the continual fire truck sirens. Yes, the room is small and the window has no view, overlooking a narrow alleyway. The bed linens and the room itself were very good quality, clean and crisp. There's free wifi and coffee machines in the room, but that's about it. The bathroom was clean and modern-style. There's no parking at the hotel, but there's city parking around the corner, and remember that there's free street parking on weekends and/or usually after 6pm - but check the meters for exact rules. We had breakfast at the Elephant & Castle, which had a buffet.

Since it was just me, the counter issue wasn't too bad, but I could definitely see it being very tight with two people. I loved that they supplied free bottled water. The location is great, about a 15 minute walk from the Westfield Mall. I was really happy with the service. I needed a lot of help with directions and they were always very helpful and pleasant with answering those questions. The bed was very comfortable and so was the couch.

Second, the room is so narrow that there was no space to put a TV right in front of the bed.

We were prepared for a small room in a sleepy neighborhood. The place was very clean and quiet. and the room was spotless, with a pleasant, neutral smell. A+ rating on the bed and pillows. Staff was friendly and helpful. Nice patio on the roof. Parking in nearby garages is $25 a day, but we were able to park on the street for free Sunday and (Monday which was a holiday). Its in the financial district, so the neighborhood is safe and quiet, but the streets roll up early and you'll have to travel for SF culture (or even a liquor store). Just a few easy blocks to BART, MUNI, Market St., Chinatown and Embarcadero. Only negatives were the small size of the [corner] room we had. College dorm room style decor. Just enough room for the bed, nightstand, desk and wall mount TV. With 2 people it was pretty tight. We were charged $3.10 for 3 local calls, which seemed a bit steep. No irons in the rooms, sheets changed daily \"upon request\". The pub next door is open till midnight and has a good selection of beer on tap. We ordered fish and chips and it was mediocre. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the CQ and would consider staying there again if the price was still right. A convenient and friendly spot for a business person without a car or tourists just looking for a clean room to sleep and shower in.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"San Luis Obispo","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-01-03T07:11:33Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"912982","reviewId":"18372682","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":2,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Yiannis","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Not Impressed","reviewText":"The hotel is in an older building that has been renovated. The initial impression was very disappointing. There was no valet parking and neither any parking provided by the hotel. We had to park about a block down the street in a public parking ($32/day). The person who was attending the reception at the time of our arrival was on a personal call. It took him quite a while to acknowledge our presence (a couple with a 2 yr old kid) and then he proceeded to take our information and check us in the most ungraceful and inhospitable way, obviously annoyed that he had to put his call on hold. We asked for a crib that he promised to deliver but never did. We had to call again later and talk with another person for the crib to arrive. We almost walked out due to that person. The room was fairly small and cramped for a suite but clean and well equipped. The rest of the hotel personnel were very polite and helpful but that first encounter set the mood for our whole stay. The hotel did provide high speed wireless internet access and they offered a nifty printing feature through printme.com where you sent a print job from your room and retrieve the print out from a printer in the general lobby area. It would be very helpful if the printer was not out of toner and the paper was not the flimsiest possible. Our stay was not a disaster but next time I will be looking for something better, I don't think it worth its price.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Portland, OR","reviewSubmissionTime":"2006-12-28T22:20:04Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"912982","reviewId":"18372627","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Terry","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great location close to Farmers Market and Embacadero","reviewText":"staff courteous and helpful rooms are on the small side and did not have a view it was like a maze getting to the room try to get a room close to the elevator they offer limited room service from the restaurant extra pillows blankets an iron and ironing board had to be picked up by you from utility closet each floor has one an its first come first get mini refrigerator is available by request loved the laundry convenient washer and dryer have plenty of coins","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"St. Thomas, Virgin Islands","reviewSubmissionTime":"2006-11-07T19:11:32Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"4","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_ca","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"912982","reviewId":"18372628","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"4105","userNickname":"David","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Small room but extremely well appointed","reviewText":"We were quite amused with the saize of the room but the quality of the facilities and staff was very good.

Staff will hold luggage for you if you have finished your stay but want to walk around athe city after checking out. The negatives. Walls are pretty thin, you can pretty much hear people talking in the next room. TV is really small. Room service menu is way overpriced.

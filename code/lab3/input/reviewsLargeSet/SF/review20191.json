The room and the common areas were very clean. What a great concept when it comes to accomodations; we really liked the included full service breakfast buffet. If you are not looking for the glitz and are interested in getting in and getting out to your activities, this is the right place to be.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Reno,Nevada","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-09-17T03:42:43Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"20191","reviewId":"20059653","photos":[],"itinId":"290994167","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Mary","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Nice quiet place!","reviewText":"Loved how close it was to the Ferry.

There were less expensive hotels to be found, by the way.  The hotel is very convenient to downtown San Francisco by public transit or car.\r\n\r\nUpon check-in the employee at the front desk advised us that we \"made a mistake with the reservation\" because our reserved room had one king bed and we didn't want that.  We were, after all, two men checking into a room with only one bed.  Except that my partner and I absolutely only wanted one bed.  And, we were in very close proximity to San Francisco, so I can't imagine that same-sex couples are a rare encounter.  I understand perhaps wanting to clarify that we only wanted one bed, but there's a tactful way to approach that situation, and this was not it.\r\n\r\nThen we arrived at the room and it appeared nice enough, until we stepped far enough into the room to see the bed/living area and realized that there was literally a bed and a TV/TV stand...nothing else.  And even worse is that the room was large, so it felt very empty and unwelcoming.  We called the front desk and the same gentleman that checked us in advised us that we \"didn't pay for that.\"  Apparently, there are extra charges for what is considered part of a standard room at every other hotel we've ever stayed at.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"Convenient to San Francisco and affordable","negativeRemarks":"Better description of what you are or aren't getting in the room for the posted rate(s).","locationRemarks":"Close proximity to San Francisco without being too close; lots of eateries and shopping nearby.","lastInitial":"C","userLocation":"Philadelphia, PA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2014-09-16T18:49:33Z","roomTypeId":200624030,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"50993","reviewId":"10000652121","photos":[],"itinId":"180111396058","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":2,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"D","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Terrible hotel!

Last night we arrived to a totally UNMADE up room, so no clean towels & I had to go all the way BACK to office (LARGE complex & our bldg was at the end). They would NOT bring them to us as \"housekeeping was closed\".  Was there for a trade show in Downtown San Fran & very tired, so having to put my clothes back on & walk back to get our towels did not make me happy, esp having to walk down the LONG stinky, noisy hallway again that night (& stinky elevator).  Esp paying what we did   fees & tax.  Didn't need studio but is all they had avail. Convenient to the frwy.

He went to check to see if any rooms were ready (it was about 3:15), came back and said they were ready.  When we went to the rooms, they were in the SMOKING wing.  Went back to desk, he says nothing else available - then finally said we could upgrade into studios - for additional $'s;  after some bickering he did finally give us a discount.  Did not realize I had book double beds (thought all motels now had queens).  Since we lost one room, luckily two of my great grandkids are tiny for their age since they had to share such a small bed with their siblings.  Also, there was a woman at the front desk who has apparently been trying to get some sort of restitution for items that were stolen from her room during her stay several weeks earlier; manager said maybe one of the maids responsible - not his responsibility!

There were broken tiles in the elevator, beds that had dilapidated springs, and no coffee maker in the room. When I went to bed the room was filled with this orange/yellow light from a light outside the window that the draperies couldn't block out.

When walking to the room a large dog was barking very loudly in one of the rooms near us (someone had broken the rule about not leaving the dog alone in the room). I returned to the front desk and I got a different room overlooking the pool.\n\nMorning? When I woke up I said that wasn't really bad. It turned out we were nearly alone on the floor.

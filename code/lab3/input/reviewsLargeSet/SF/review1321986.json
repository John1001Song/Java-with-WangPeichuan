They also took dogs, so I was ecstatic. Half way through my stay, I was asked if there were problems with my dog, as it was \"barking excessively\" which was complete BS. My dog only barked if kids ran down the hallway, slammed their doors or if drunk mid 40 year olds pretending to be 21 again, were throwing their high heels down the hall and acting like children, then yes, he barked. But it was ok, for other guests to act like animals. I was asked why my dog was barking so excessively, which again, he wasn't. and I stated the said reasons. She said that I could no longer leave my room without my dog. In which I replied well, I can't bring my dog to the bridge, to alcatraz and basically named off every single attraction in the San Fran region. She said, that I had to hire a pet sitter, at like 50 bucks an hour or some ridiculous garbage. I was basically forced to keep my dog in the car, or just not go anywhere. But yet, guests were still acting like children and weren't being punished. Kids were running down the hallway screaming at 6:45 in the morning and thats how I woke up every day. Instead of refunding us or helping us, she offered a refund and to find me somewhere else to say.

This was our second time at the hotel. Modern hotel with good service. Took advantage of the beautiful spa and the work-out room. We loved the bar on the 1st floor. Sean the bartender was amazing! Good location for shopping and for the MOMA and conventions. It was only about a mile to the ferry building.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Los Angeles, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-12-01T21:27:52Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"1321986","reviewId":"20380144","photos":[],"itinId":"344218685","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"A","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Not what I expected from the Regis!","reviewText":"The hotel atmosphere was super cold including the staff and decoration.

On several occasions, they went above and beyond our expectations to make our trip memorable. We have never been treated so well at any other hotel. The staff actuallly greeted us by name! .

There are plenty of coffee shops and diners around to get breakfast but an early mornng coffee can be got on the 4th floor of the hotel for no charge. The concierge was fantastic in recommending great places to eat and making the reservations too.

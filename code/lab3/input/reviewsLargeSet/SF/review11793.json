We picked it because of its proximity to the Caltrain - which wasn't remarkably close anyway, but the location was okay for SF visitors.\r\n\r\nMy room was underwhelming in general.  Fine, no outstanding amenities.  The building felt old, and not updated anytime recently.\r\n\r\nDay 1 - The mini-fridge had a solid rattle which kept me up at night, needed to unplug it.  My room overlooked the roof of a shorter building which had a noisy air conditioning unit which would wake me up when it restarted.\r\n\r\nDay 2 - Woke up to find out there had been a two hour blackout in the hotel, so my digital clock was wrong and could only be corrected by the staff.\r\n\r\nThen had an awful shower, which is tough to explain.  It had one knob, off when pointing straight up.  If you turned it to the right, you got cold water.  To the left, hot water.  But no way to get warm water.  It felt like some scenario interview question at Google that I wasn't smart enough to figure out.\r\n\r\nI found out that my co-workers had their own special issues with their rooms and various noises.\r\n\r\nI complained to the staff, which got my clock fixed, no change to my shower - I spent the rest of my days turning the knob back and forth during showers to avoid freezing and burning.  I'm not quite sure about the fridge, whether it was replaced or not, but it rattled less.\r\n\r\nThings were pretty uneventful for the next few days, until I was woken up on my last morning by a fire alarm.

We were happy with the size of our room since it was much larger than we expected, and we also liked the location of the hotel. \r\nUnfortunately we did not have ANY hot water in our room during our entire stay at the Pickwick. After chilly/windy days touring around the city, this was not an ideal situation to come back to. I let the front desk know, and she said she would let maintenance know. No one followed up with us, and it didn't get fixed. After our second round of ice cold showers the next day, we went back down to the front desk and spoke with a woman who told us that it was going to be looked into and that they had been having problems with their boiler. It wasn't until we asked for the manager to call us directly (since the front desk staff provided us with no help or answers), that we were given an apology. The manager did offer a small reimbursement, but that didn't fix our problem! Our water problem was ice cold our entire stay. Thankfully we were only there three nights.\r\nIn addition, after we had been storing items in our fridge, we learned that it hadn't been working.\r\nMy husband and I are very flexible and easy going people, but we would not stay at this hotel again. There were too many issues we dealt with during a short stay. We would have much rather spent more money to have stayed at a higher quality hotel where we would have been more comfortable.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Boston ","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-07-06T14:54:25Z","roomTypeId":1224,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":true,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"hotelId":"11793","reviewId":"57741450f450ed332a059129","photos":[],"itinId":"1138561554125","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[{"isFlaggable":true,"userNickname":"Allen Allgood","displayLocale":"en_us","date":"2016-08-08T20:31:35Z","id":"e5f1fb66-3c69-46d9-aeb7-873d22fb9726","response":"Thank you for taking the time writing this great review about your experience with us and mentioning our staff!

Got rousted multiple times by loud cars, but mostly from loud people, which should provide a great read on how poor the windows really are in mitigating noise.

Checked out that morning.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Pickwick offers great promise with its location & underlying bones, the ownership group should take a hard look at upgrading its infrastructure on simple items like windows, a decent hot water system, and new mattresses.

Burger was good but undercooked (mine was the last order, at 10 pm).  They serve American and Mediterranean food, as well as pizza (which the guy sitting near me said was very good ... he ordered a second one to go).  I had the Mezze plate -- falafel, spanakopita, hummus, dolmas, pita -- all very tasty.  I would definitely order it again.

Because it is a small hotel, the hotel staff greeted us by name as we came and went, which added a nice personal touch.  The hotel is clean and comfortable and in a lovely old building that was clearly updated recently.  The room was very very small, which might bother some people, but we found that it is was so well appointed and so cleverly laid out that we did not mind the size.

The street was also very noisy with sometimes Ambulances and Firetrucks blaring every 5-10 minutes as early as 5-6 in the morning.  Before 7am on our second night there, the entire building fire alarms went off and we all ran outside in our pajamas as the Fire Department showed up, came in for 5 minutes, and left.  It would have been nice to get an explanation from the staff but none came and understandably they were probably getting inundated with not-so-pleasant calls from customers that day.  \r\n\r\nThe pipes also screech very loudly when people shower so if someone next to you takes a very early shower, chances are you'll be getting up with them unless you've bought earplugs in advance.  Also, there is not a huge amount of sound proofing and if you have a child next to your room or loud adults they will definitely become part of your room atmosphere whether you like it or not.  \r\n\r\nAnyway, not trying to be over critical but we payed a pretty high rate for our room during the conference (which is kinda expected).

We both loved the old-fashioned charm of the decor. Unfortunately, it also means that the buildiing is quite old, which means very thin walls. Outside of that, we enjoyed the room. The desk clerks were nice and the concierge was very helpful and accurate about getting around. Within a short walk, there were a variety of restaurants, Powell Station which is a hub for all forms of public transportation, and a fantastic multi-level mall. The only downside to the location is the prevalence of homeless people. They were several within one block. But this is not the fault of the hotel. The city should really find a solution to this.

Unfortunately, things went downhill from here. Once I made my way to my room, I discovered that the \"run of the house\" rooms were more like closets with beds in them than actual hotel rooms. The tiny, cramped quarters included old, battered furniture; frayed, stained carpeting and decor that resembled something along the lines of \"Victorian garage sale.\" If this weren't bad enough, when I finally arrived back in my room later that night, exhausted and ready to take a shower and go to bed, I discovered that my hot water didn't work in my shower (but it worked in the sink). It was explained to me that the hotel is on one boiler and, when they're full, the hot water sometimes runs out and that it should be back within 10 minutes. When I explained that it worked fine in my sink, they continued to debate before finally sending someone up to verify that I, indeed, the shower didn't have any hot water. They eventually (about an hour later) moved me to another room (closet) at the opposite end of the hall where the hot water worked in both the shower and the sink...imagine that. Other than the pleasant bellman, this hotel was terrible from top to bottom. If you're used to Motel 6, then this might suffice, but if you're looking for something clean and comfortable with even a touch of refinement, you're barking up the wrong tree here.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":2,"ratingHotelCondition":1,"ratingService":1,"ratingRoomComfort":1,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Orange County, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-05-05T16:22:01Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Perfero","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"11793","reviewId":"18299008","photos":[],"itinId":"302678218","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Paul","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Good for the price","reviewText":"Nothing special but decent and great location","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Los Angeles, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-02-01T02:07:38Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"11793","reviewId":"18299065","photos":[],"itinId":"305726039","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Paul","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Would stay there again","reviewText":"Convenient location for downtown shopping and business.

Comparing to the other big-chain hotels in the area, Pickwick offers unbeatable value. The location is superb even for those not attending a conference. Just a block away is Market St/Powell St, where one can catch the famous Powell-Hyde cable car, as well as MUNI buses/streetcars to other tourist attractions like Fishermen's Wharf, Ferri Building, and Telegraph Hill. For those who like to shop, Bloomingdale, Macy's, and big name fashion stores like Levi's are only a couple of blocks away. While Pickwick is not the newest hotel (one can see rusted outer windows left over from the old days), it's been renovated sufficiently that everything is up to modern day standards. Their choice of bathroom amenities (Bath & Body Works) pretty much says it all. My GF and I had a great time staying at Pickwick, and it'll be our top choice when we come back to San Francisco in a couple of years.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Ontario, Canada","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-11-07T22:35:06Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"11793","reviewId":"18299246","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Kimberli","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Party Central","reviewText":"Overall the hotel was pretty nice.

A lot of young crowds in and out of the hotel and towards the evening there were quite a few young adults partying in San Francisco. Perhaps it was the just the wrong weekend to come to SF and the guests were just a little too rowdy. On Sunday morning at 1 am I was rudely awaken by loud and obviously drunk people shouting in the halls completely oblivious to the fact that people might be sleeping.

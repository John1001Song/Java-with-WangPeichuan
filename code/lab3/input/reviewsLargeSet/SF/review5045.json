The surrounding neighborhood is obviously gentrifying - a lot of students living in the area - but it still has a lot of \"intetesting\" characters roaming around; though what major city anywhere in world doesn't. When you book make sure to keep in mind that valet parking at the hotel will cost you $45/day + $6 tax. Parking (and driving) in the city is challenging at best, but you may find cheaper overnight parking in one of several public parking garages located very near the hotel. Pro: The room was clean and well-equipped. Con: the bed was very uncomfortable. Two other pros: the hotel staff was nice and accommodating for sure, and the place is surrounded by small cafes for breakfast and lunch.

I wouldn't let my wife walk the streets around the hotel alone. The hotel staff was very helpful, they were the best part of our stay, responding quickly to our requests. We had to change rooms on our second night because there was a party going on in the room next to us, with about 20 people.

The location is good if you intend to stay in central SF. It is about a 15 minute walk from the Powell Street BART (10 minutes going the other way due to the lay of the land). The BART will take you directly from SFO for about $8. Union Square, which is the shopping centre of the city, is equidistant more or less.\n\nThe area around the hotel does seem a bit low brow when you first turn up but it is better described as 'studenty'. It is certainly not at all threatening, even at night. It certainly compares well with a 5 block radius of Leicester Square if you want a comparison with London.\n\nMost of the main attractions in SF are close enough to walk to if you can hack the hills. If not, there are good comms links nearby, especially on Market Street. (Powell Street BART is on a junction with Market Street). The Pier building is about 20 minutes away and Fisherman's Quay probably about 30 minutes if you feel the need to go there.\n\nAs for the hotel - I was very happy and I would stay there again in a heartbeat. It must be one of the best value hotels in that area with no compromises on service or comfort for the star band it's in. There is no restaurant. There are loads of exxcellent cafes within a stone's throw so a morning brew is no drama. I can't talk about parking as I was on foot.\n\nOverall, very happy.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"Good areas: Union Square for shopping and people watching. Same same for Union Street shops up by the Marina. The Piers for views of the Bay. Crissy Field and the Golden Gate Bridge are great areas and if you are up to it there are some great views on the western side of Fort Point, up on the hill above the Presidio. I also liked Alcatraz but that's me. The Art Museum tat the eastern edge of Crissy Field looks stunning.\n\nNot so Good: Fisherman's Quay did nothing for me. The Maritime Museum is in this area though so that's a redeeeming feature if you like ships. I thought North Beach was a dump but again, personal preference. It's certainly pretty seedy at the edges.\n\nAvoid: I would really avoid SOMA and even the western end of Market Street gets a bit dodgy at night.\n\nBe aware that there is a huge homeless problem in SF and while most of them are too far gone to want to trouble anyone, they can be a little intimidating if you're a quiet type.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that signage is not a strong point in the Presidio / Marina Area and that the roads up to the bridge are being rebuilt. It is probably better to walk / bike up from Crissy Fields along the Bay shore rather than through the centre of the Presidio. It's easier to navigate and the views are bettter.\n\nI only passed through Chinatown on the way to North Beach so I can't comment. I also never got up to the Coit Tower but I am told it is a nice view point. I doubt it rivals the one on Alcatraz.","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Canada","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-12-06T02:16:07Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5045","reviewId":"34919091","photos":[],"itinId":"1","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"good","reviewText":"good hotel , the worst tv channels , rare smell in the closed , very confortable room, you get what you pay","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"Union Square, Fishermans Wharf, golden gate","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Mexico","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-12-02T18:53:04Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5045","reviewId":"34919092","photos":[],"itinId":"1","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Very stylish hotel, but iffy location","reviewText":"Loved the hotel service; the concierge was great!

That is okay beause there are plenty of places to eat in the area. I booked one of the traditional rooms, and while they are clean they are sort of dated looking and I wanted to change rooms. I asked numerous times to change, agreeing to pay the upgrade charge. The front desk told me the hotel was booked, even though on their reservation internet site it said there were rooms available. I was told by the front desk maybe I wanted to check their sister hotel. The next day I asked again and they hesitated to move me again stating it was full. I explained that there were rooms on-line and they said they had available rooms but had to leave them open for people checking in (that did not make sense). I kept checking and asking until finally the lady said \"fine just give it to her.\" They ended up moving me after much negotiation and I do not understand why they could not do that the day before. The remodeled rooms are much nicer and worth the aggravation. I liked the hotel overall and will go back, and would recommend it to others. Also they are pet friendly which is nice.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"NY, NY","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-03-02T20:24:24Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5045","reviewId":"20258370","photos":[],"itinId":"351168472","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Lola","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great Hotel- Not one Complaint!!!","reviewText":"This was a great hotel for the price!

The hotel was well maintained, with slightly eccentric décor, both in the rooms and in the lobby. While there's perhaps not the same impeccable attention to detail you'd see in a 4- or 5-star hotel, I had zero complaints.\n\nThe location is handy. The hotel is right on a bus route and is also a few blocks from the cable car line. (Transit in SF is great.)\n\nThe front desk staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, and had great suggestions for everything I needed. In fact, all staff I encountered were cheerful and nice. In short, I'm not sure you could do better for the price. In fact, even if I'd paid more for my hotel, I still think this was a great pick.\n\nIn short, I was very happy with my stay and would recommend Hotel Vertigo without hesitation.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Toronto","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-11-23T15:43:24Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"25","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_au","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5045","reviewId":"20258362","photos":[],"itinId":"1677671","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"3081","userNickname":"Renate","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Quite good hotel but missed not having coffee/tea making in room.","reviewText":"Overall satisfied.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Australia","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-11-21T04:29:40Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5045","reviewId":"20258299","photos":[],"itinId":"343177577","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Brandy","brandType":"Expedia","title":"would recommend only in the if it is not hot outside.","reviewText":"Staff was very nice and helpful.

First trip to San Francisco, and we loved it! Staff was very friendly and helpful. It was extremely close to major bus lines, and there were some great little neighborhood shops right outside your door! The pizza and gelato places were great, and there were two grocery stores on the block. It is somewhat close to the Tenderloin district, so you might want to watch which direction you go at night! No problems at all near the hotel though. Internet was a little slow, but who wants to stay cooped up on the computer in a city full of things to do? No A/C in the room, but really most of the time you don't need it I think. It just so happened that we hit the city in their Indian summer, so the first few days were a bit warm. Still, the ceiling fan and open windows did the job just fine. We loved the hotel decor, very modern and interesting. Overall, very happy with the hotel and our stay there!

So they got the job done, but weren't terribly friendly. It got a little better over the next couple of days; they did their job, but it wasn't the \"warmest\" place.\n\nWe chose a non-renovated room for the lower rate, and it was just that. The twin beds were very, very, very firm. Outside our window was a huge white wall about 10 feet away, so we had no view and very little natural light in our room.\n\nThe room was old, but clean. It was also dark because the light bulbs weren't bright enough. Other than the hard beds and the crappy view, the room was fine. The shower was hot, and the tap-water tasted just fine.\n\nWireless internet was free, but a little slow. Valet parking was expensive--$35/day plus tax.\n\nSince this was significantly cheaper than other hotels, I'm definitely not complaining -- just keepin' it real!

Neither Jonathan Adler-twee, or coldly modern, it's a bright, intelligent eclectic mix that feels just residential enough to be comfortable for people-watching, but stylish enough that it's winning and smile-inducing.\n\nThere is a smallish elevator, and an amazing, apropos staircase that extends to the top floors. The view down the staircase's inner well from a higher floor to the lobby is almost perfectly suited to the hotel's name.\n\nThe Vertigo is not at all stuffy or pretentious, and escapes the 'boutique hotel' template that the W has foisted off an on overpaying public. I stayed at the SF W during the same trip, and I much preferred the Vertigo, which was about one-third less expensive. The W is very stylish, but I find it overwhelming, even grating in its attempts to seduce.\n\nThe rooms are comfortable and stylish, with just the right amount of the signature orange elements; the leather club chair in each room is more the color of a burnt orange Coach bag. The beds are comfortable, and happily, the windows open.\n\nThe staff is helpful, but unobtrusive; there is neither the aggressive cult vibe of some upscale hotels, nor any sense of snobbishness in this Nob Hill location.\n\nAll in all, it's a little gem; I would happily return.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Minneapolis, MN","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-08-11T07:42:04Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Other","categoryLabel":""}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5045","reviewId":"20258466","photos":[],"itinId":"326793799","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Michael","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Walking distance to Union Square.","reviewText":"A block or two the wrong way can put you in a rather seedy area.\nBut we knew where we were headed and walked to both drinks, dinner and brunch the next morning with no concern.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"San Ramon, Ca","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-08-06T04:05:40Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5045","reviewId":"20258519","photos":[],"itinId":"324337119","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Stephen","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Nice Experience at Hotel Vertigo","reviewText":"The hotel is clean and nicely furnished and is a convenient location.

San Francisco is full of hotels and for the priced we paid I guess we could have found a better option.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":2,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Rome, Italy","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-08-19T08:38:41Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5045","reviewId":"20258292","photos":[],"itinId":"285770360","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"chris","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Perfect location","reviewText":"The Hotel Vertigo is in a prime location for those looking to experience many different areas of San Francisco.

The entire hotel is well branded with the Vertigo theme and sleek modern furnishings. The one thing we didn't like was the bed. It had some protective layer on the mattress and it was very slippery to sleep on. The staff were very helpful and accommodating. They even had a luggage drop off service since our flight wasn't until late at night. We're from New York City, and we thought the neighborhood was just fine.

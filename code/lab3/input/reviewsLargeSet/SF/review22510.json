However, the WiFi did not work in my room at any point during the 3 nights I stayed there.

I also had the option of using it in the Starbucks onsite.  Those options were not high on my list.  The window air conditioning unit was quite loud - it would have been too loud for me to run at night, but fortunately, the weather was good and it wasn't necessary to run anything other than the fan on the unit.  The lighting could really use some improvement - the room was quite dim for my needs, and on the last night, the lights by the beds didn't work at all - they blinked a couple of times, but seemed to be shorting out.

In those three or four years there has been a notable decline: the front desk was under staffed, carpeting in the hallways has come loose in large wrinkles and folds (a tripping hazard that interferes with rolling luggage too), a layer of dust and grime had built up for weeks in our bathroom (which had a strangely antique toilet like something from a 19th century prison), and on our second to last night we saw a mouse. The elevators also seemed to be overtaxed and slow; I don't know if any were out of service at the time, but on more than one occassion we (and other guests staying on our floor) found it faster to take the stairs than to continue waiting for another full elevator to arrive.\r\n\r\nThe area immediately around the Whitcomb has also worsened: homeless people living in tents, getting in fights, and doing hard drugs, all within steps of the door. During our stay the exterior glass door to the Starbucks in the lobby was shattered in an incident with a drunk homeless person.

The room states that it sleeps up to four people but only provides the room with 2 large white towels in the shower. The next morning when the cleaning crew came they knocked once and did not wait for people in the room to respond before entering. Perhaps that was our fault that we did not put the DO NOT DISTURB at 7AM sign on the door first. But seriously, as a courtesy, please at least wait a few seconds for people to answer before entering.

When I went to brush the “crumbs” away, the sheets became smeared with blood.  At that time, I called the front desk about the bed bugs and the response was “Well, ma’am, I’m not a bug expert.”  I replied that I wanted another room immediately and a key to room 675 was promptly brought up and silently handed to me at the door.  No one apologized for our inconvenience nor were we even offered help to move our things to the other room.  \r\nThe following morning we checked out two days early from our 3-day reservation.

Kevin, one of the management personnel, even knocked on our door to relay well wishes. When I apologized for the messy condition of our room -- we had just checked in, and our suitcases were open and our clothes were strewn about -- he said with a chuckle, \"You're just being a family.\" I really appreciated this warm detail.\r\n\r\nOne of my concerns about staying at a San Francisco hotel was bedbugs. Management went out of its way to assure us that their hotel takes great care in keeping their rooms bedbug-free. In fact, Kevin and one of the housekeeping leads took us on an inspection of the room before we settled in. I really appreciated and felt humbled by this extra effort.

I don't know why. We didn't ask for one. In the bathroom there was a chair you could sit on ehile showering if you are disabled. We arrived at 12 pm. The room was cold. There were about 12 degrees C outside. There was a heater near the window that wasn't on. when it was on, even for a low temperature, it made an incredible noise that we barely could sleep. After we used the toilet and flushed, the tank was constantly refilling itself making noise of course. So it was broken. The next morning we called housekeeping. Someone came and repaired it. After we used the toilet again, it was broken again! So we had to put our hand in the water in the tank to stop the refilling noise every time. \r\nThat day I dared to wash my hair. I saw there wasn't a hairdryer. I called house keeping again to ask for one and went in the shower. After 20 minutes, someone called and asked if the dryer wasn't in the bathroom. I said no. They said they eould send one shortly. I waited. After another 20 minutes, I called again. They said it s on its way. After another 20 min, I called and asked to speak to the manager. After one hour, when my hair already was dry because I used the room heater, the dryer arrived. After a few minutes, housekeeping came again with working tools to find a place on the wall for the hairdryer. The man barely could speak english.The wifi wasn't working at all.

The bathroom is clean, but the temperature at the sink is inconsistent -- it often gets very hot suddenly, and I burned myself many times during my stay. \r\n\r\nThere isn't a foyer in the room, and the bed is a little too close to the door. Almost every night I heard some inconsiderate guests laughing and shouting in the hallway while walking back to their rooms. \r\n\r\nThere was a dance event in the hotel's function room next to the lobby, every night during my stay the lobby was filled with people and was very loud - My room was on the 5th floor, but I imagine guests on the 2nd floor might be bothered by the noise. \r\n\r\nI didn't know the hotel has a gym until I saw the picture online today. Would have been nice to work out a little there. \r\n\r\nThe hotel is 5 min. walk to the civic center. The train station is right outside the hotel, and bus stops are nearby.

I didn't feel safe on some nearby blocks, and that's coming from someone who grew up in the murder capital of America. Speaking of murders, I awoke at 4:00 am to 3 gun shots in close range.

He arrived within 5 minutes; by this, I was impressed. The water continued to run while I waited for his arrival. So, I'd judge the water had run for, at very least, 15 minutes at this point. He took the shower head apart and put it back together then let it run more. Am I clearly illustrating how much water was wasted in this process? He let it run. It finally got hot. He said the boiler is in the basement and it serves the upper floors first so I had to wait for it to make its way all the way back down to the second floor where my room was.

Although it's on Market street it's at the very rough end at the top of the Mission district. The hotel seems to trade on it's heritage, and by that I mean it's stuck in the 1940's decor-wise. As other reviewers have commented, it's very dark, oppressively so. I didn't use the restaurant, couldn't wait to get out of the place, to be honest.\r\n\r\nThe room itself was very basic, the heating system (not sure it had A/C, maybe just an evaporator) was at least 30 years old and made a terrible racket when turned on but nothing like as loud as the extractor fan in the toilet.\r\n\r\nThe other guests were extremely loud, it sounded as though they were playing soccer in the hallway at night and frequently shouted to each other through the open doors of their rooms. As per the title of the review, it felt like a hostel rather then a hotel.\r\n\r\nI did have a laugh at the note in the room, \"what one thing we could do to make your stay more enjoyable\", uh, tear the place down?","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":1,"ratingHotelCondition":1,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":1,"positiveRemarks":"Nothing at all.","negativeRemarks":"See above :)","locationRemarks":"It is fairly central but i'd be wary of walking to far in some directions at night.

So you think you're paying less for the hotel but calculate that, plus the room tax and you're paying easily 65 dollars more a night. The bed was not comfortable, and the toilet was on a pedestal which was weird but again, that's part of the charm of the building I suppose.

The building is very old, so don't expect the quality of the building to be on par with brand new hotels. That being said, the rooms were spacious enough, and being someone who enjoys historic buildings, I enjoyed the atmosphere. The staff was pretty friendly, and the housekeeping did a good job keeping our room clean. \r\n\r\n  My only complaint about the hotel is the area that its located. There is a huge homeless population that seems to stick to the area right outside the hotel, and all down market Street. It made my girlfriend and I very uncomfortable to even step foot out of the hotel without calling an Uber first. The BART station stairs , which are right outside the hotel, is very intimidating, as it is not light up at all and there is always someone sleeping on the stairs or begging for money. Lastly, there's a small park right across the street next to a Burger King that has approximately 20 or so homeless people loitering around along with all of their belongings. Obviously this is absolutely no fault of the hotel. In fact, hotel has security officers at night to prevent those who aren't guests from coming in, so I was never worried about safety within the hotel.\r\n\r\nOverall, I was quite happy with my stay at Hotel Whitcomb. Especially for being San Francisco, it is really hard to find a decent hotel at a cheap price, so If you're on a budget and don't mind the area outside the hotel, then this place is a great deal!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"IN","reviewSubmissionTime":"2015-11-26T20:12:18Z","roomTypeId":17886,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":true,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"22510","reviewId":"565508f850223c096874d8b6","photos":[],"itinId":"1121260577692","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"","reviewText":"Great stay, clean rooms, although the room was quite small and promised a view.

Housekeeping is good and efficient. If you plan on sleeping in, hang the do not disturb sign on the door. No fridge, microwave, or coffee maker in my room. But there was an ice bucket. Vending was by the elevator. Wi-Fi worked O.K. but the business center computer and printer come with a charge. Biggest downside is the neighborhood. During the day an open air drug market runs unfettered across the way. Because of this, many guests seemed to take a cab out of the area rather than walk. Even for nearby venues.

Adjust rating!","reviewText":"I guess the main problem with this hotel is the 3.5 stars it has. Comparable 3.5 star hotels are simply better. This expectation is not met. The hotel is a historic building and the efforts to keep it going seem to be kept at the minimum required, like the carpets or the creaking elevator doors. Having said that, it's not a tragedy like some reviews state. Wifi was fine, shower was too small but fine, room was OK and I asked for a quite one so I got a room in the back (not market street) which allowed me to sleep.

The Hotel Whitcomb is on Market Street, in the heart of the Theatre district and a block from the Civic Center.  Yes, at night this part of Market can be, er, interesting - but the Hotel goes to great pains to maintain the safety and security of its guests, and I never had a single moment that I felt uneasy or unprotected.  As for the facility itself, well, it's one of the grand hotels from a century ago when things were more gracious and elegant, and it's lost none of its stately beauty with the passage of time.  The lobby is astonishing in its patrician beauty, the elevators and hallways were impeccable, and the Market Street Grille (which serves excellent food) manages to be uniquely elegant and welcoming to the casual guest at the same time.\r\n\r\nOur room was spacious and comfortable, with two closets, a writing desk and wonderfully inviting beds and pillows.  The weakest aspect of the whole thing was the bathroom - but its only drawback is that it could use a little updating.  It was impeccably clean, with excellent plumbing, water pressure and counter area for toiletries.  And the white tea bath soaps are the best I've ever had, at any hotel, anywhere.  \r\n\r\nThe hotel staff was professional, gracious and efficient and seemed genuinely dedicated to making us welcome and comfortable.  In short, there's nothing not to love here.  It will be my pleasure to stay at the Hotel Whitcomb on my next visit to San Francisco.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"T","userLocation":"Montana","reviewSubmissionTime":"2015-06-07T20:02:23Z","roomTypeId":16101,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"22510","reviewId":"5573abd8b4f8340a10b94a43","photos":[],"itinId":"1106797051295","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"HMP MMD","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":2,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Arvind","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Historical hotel but not practical","reviewText":"The rooms are small, the table is small not practical to work.

The bed was not made, garbage, used towels on the floor, the bath room was filthy and it was clear that the room had not been cleaned. The most upsetting part about all of this is I called hours before to confirm my 4 night stay and my arrival time for check in.. This was completely unacceptable . I complained at the front desk and asked for my money back (which I got back 4 days later) , the man at the front desk didn't seem to care about the reluctance of his staff.

Lots of homeless in the area just outside too. Made me sad, but coming home after hours also made me have to be all that much more alert.

But you aren't going to be wanting to kick your shoes off and relax, you aren't going to want to hang in the lobby or have friends come meet you, you aren't going to want to do anything but drop your bags and get outside. \r\nMy advice: skip this hotel. If money is tight, Stay at a holiday inn express  (not the fanciest of places but clean and feels it). If money isn't an issue, there are dozens of other options in the city.\r\n\r\nLet me tell you one other part of my trip: I had some downtime between meetings, I ended up walking over to the JW Marriott to hang out and read in their lobby, just so I didn't have to go back to the whitcomb.

They weren't bad just don't expect early check-in and some of them reek of marijuana and don't really convey professionalism.

On one occasion a receptionist answered the phone whilst in mid-conversation with us, another time another refused to let a colleague use 'his' printer because the other was broken and asked us go to the back of the line (we said no). When we went to check-out, one of the two duty receptionists announced that he was going on his lunch break - leaving the young lady mentioned above to work her way through the long line of guests waiting in line. She was very patient, and clearly under a lot of pressure.\r\n\r\nOur room was ok - although there were a couple of socks that didn't belong to us under the bed, and I'm fairly sure the sheets had been used for a previous guest. We asked for an extra pillow, but apparently the hotel had run out.

Very little water pressure in the shower, and the glass shelf above the sink was inconveniently located.\n\nMy daughter swears it's haunted. Well, I don't know, it could just be the age.

It hasn't been updated in what looks like over 40 years. I chose this hotel because it looked like it had charm from the photos and had decent reviews. The 2nd floor is definitely haunted and the temperature continued to drop as I walked down a long dreary hallway. My room was just has scary. The bathroom door was swung open and it had dim, cold lighting with an aweful chill in the room. I felt like I just entered a horror movie. Needless to say as the night hours crept in I felt increasingly uncomfortable with the heavy energy of spirits. I moved rooms to the 6th floor which I was appreciative of. It had better energy, since it had been more recently updated, but there was still something very off, like if you went to the bathroom, the door would shut on you. I dont know what went down in this hotel, and I didnt even know it was haunted until I asked the front desk if there had been any reports and he said yes. The amount of dust and stuffiness made it difficult to breathe and by midnight I was so freaked out I checked out and moved to another hotel. This in my opinion should not be a running hotel, but a destination for paranormal researchers. If the owner cared at all he would reupholster the lobby furniture removing the cigarette stains and warped lumpy stuffing that looks like a camels back.

The concierge had told us to catch the train to San Jose airport instead of a shuttle, but neglected to tell us if we missed the connection, we would have to wait a full hour to catch the next one. Once we figured this out, we had already bought tickets that we couldn't use and had to catch a very expensive cab ride instead to make our flight.\n\nIf you enjoy historical buildings, this one is really nice, but the neighborhood not great.

We were one of maybe 4 parties waiting for clean rooms at 3:30pm on a Monday afternoon. Thank God some man joined the front desk staff and helped the line move. I could tell he was the most efficient person there while an older man with glasses mumbled in the corner and some crazed Spanish woman acted like everything was falling apart (even excusing herself to go get a sip of water mid-check-in). My second issue with this hotel is the location. Obviously they are not in control of this, but families should know that it's on the edge of The Tenderloin section (aka full of druggies/homeless people). I was very concerned walking home at night after 8pm. Homeless people are constantly hanging out in the lobby and the attached Starbucks.

On check-in the entire hotel computer system was offline, causing longer process to sign in. However our keycards were experiencing problems because without the servers, they could not be repaired. For 2 days we had to do multiple trips via elevator to see if they worked or not. It was terrible, only once did a maintenance worker let us into our room. I asked if there would be compensation for this, they said It's BEYOND our control. The breakfast wait staff service was slow and unresponsive. There was only 4 families during the breakfast service, and 2 servers :( Shower in bathroom water would splash out of the curtain and land on tile floor, very slippery and dangerous. Had to waste a towel every morning as a floor mat. The walls are painted concrete so be careful. Wifi was working for a day or so, afterwards it was spotty connections. Also note we were worried with the BART strike we called ahead to see if shuttle service was offered by hotel: NOPE. It's a good location due to proximity to the UN Plaza BART station, however homeless people is rampant. Actually all of downtown SF it's like 10-15 homeless people per block, just overall sad. They don't panhandle aggressively in front of the hotel, just be cautious at night. The Starbucks connected to the hotel is always packed early morning.

There was a waiting line to check in because one of the receptionists was being monopolized by a group. My room was old but comfortable. The heating unit worked well to remove the chill of a mid-May stay. It was in the fifties outside. The elevators were slooow, and the stairs were hidden and hard to negotiate. The employees were friendly but unobtrusive, just as I like them. The hotel was also a stone's throw from the BART and Metro station, which was nice when it came time to catch a plane home. I thought it interesting that there was a Starbucks just off the entrance, and another Starbucks a few blocks down the street. They're popping up like weeds. I walked north several blocks to catch the cable car, only to discover that it was south of the hotel. Dinner at Fisherman's Wharf was my San Francisco favorite - clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl and a glass of Anchor Steam. It would have been wonderful except that I was alone and had to prepare for court the next day.

So my room wasn't ready because the staff didn't feel like working? Super off putting. We finally got to our room and the bed was horrible. Lumpy, hard, not good.\n\nThankfully we were then able to leave the hotel (which took a while with the extremely slow elevator). When we returned that evening I wanted to heat up my dinner, and called the front desk to see if I could use their microwave since our room didn't have one. I was told there was not a single microwave in the entire hotel, so I had to eat my dinner cold.\n\nWhen it was time to go to bed we found that the curtains didn't actually close on our windows, so we had to sleep with the lights shining in from other buildings.

Both were unfriendly from the first encounter and when I asked, (but absolutely did not expect) if they had any rooms ready before check-in ('cause some hotels do that if they have one), I received a lecture in scathing tones and recriminations just for asking. My boyfriend and I sat in the lobby for hours while we watched other couples go up (we asked one, and they got a king-sized for 2, like we were waiting for), but the front desk told us over and over they had nothing. When I asked if it was because we had booked with Expedia, rather than direct,he exploded and told me he was \"a human being\" and not to insult him in such a way--then gave us a key to our room.

We arrived at 1:30 and just as it says on the reservation, they did not let us check in until 3 PM but did hold our luggage. Also to note, after we checked out, they still held our luggage for half a day we still had left to the city.\nAt night, the area STILL has a lot of tourists, even in the early morning hours. I will admit, the riffraff is out in more force at night. As two young men, we were never bothered,, but I could see a single woman's reluctance.\nOverall a pleasant enough experience and well worth the cost- offset.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2012-07-31T04:33:59Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"22510","reviewId":"37240085","photos":[],"itinId":"148739553647","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":2,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"backpackers","reviewText":"Great for backpackers, as the hotel was full of them.\nNot so good for a business man trying to get some work done.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2012-07-29T21:03:12Z","roomTypeId":17886,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"BusinessTravelers","categoryLabel":"BusinessTravelers"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"hotelId":"22510","reviewId":"37239412","photos":[],"itinId":"148741813618","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Angie","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Fantastic staff in a historic gem","reviewText":"This is a beautiful, historic Hotel with courteous, professional staff, a gorgeous lobby, and pleasant, well appointed rooms.

We booked our hotel through one of Expedia's deals for 4 nights. When we arrived at 12pm there was no room ready (check in is at 3 but they didn't even try to accommodate us.) The man at the desk told us that he would need to put a $200 \"hold\" charge on my credit card for incidentals since I already prepaid the room. When we started asking questions about this charge and said we had never heard of this before, the man told us \"well in America, many hotels do this\" - we're from Philadelphia...\n\nThe hotel is VERY old and not particular clean. The tile in the bathroom was loose and the carpet was dirty. I wore my flip flops in the room all weekend.\n\nPart of the reason I booked this hotel was that it was very central to everything I wanted to do. Although this hotel may be centrally located, it is in a TERRIBLE location. If you make a right out of the hotel, you will run into VERY aggressive homeless people and drug dealers.

Although the hotel itself served all the basic needs I required, as a solo female traveller, I had some difficulty feeling comfortable walking around the immediate area due to the large amounts of drunk/high vagrants on the street. I'm from a big city - I don't scare easily - but when I first surfaced onto Market St. from the underground train station and essentially walked right into a violent fight/chasing/screaming match between two homeless men, I was a little concerned that I'd made a bad choice. My first impression was rough - but the city was so great overall, I chose to forgive this experience....\n\nAfter 4 days in the San Fran, my advice to any solo female travellers is simple: feel free to walk/take transit/streetcars/cable cars from your hotel during the day, and stick to cabs at night. The hotel is actually in a pretty great location for most things - I walked all the way to Haight-Ashbury, was right on the bus line for Mission District, and right on the streetcar line to head up to Alcatraz.\n\nJust be smart at night - aware of your surroundings - and like I did, decline the offer for drugs at 6am from the dudes on the street when you're hitting the streets early to get back to the airport...... :)","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"I absolutely fell in love with the Mission District in San Fransisco.

All we had to do was walk across the street and pick up a cable car or a few blocks away and grab a bus.

Not saying that it should stop anyone from choosing this hotel, but it is something to remember when choosing.\n\nThe rooms were decent considering when we were researching, there were many hotel options with shared bathrooms. However, if you want a working ice machine, either request a room not on the third floor (until they get a new machine) or be prepared to travel a floor or two to get some ice. The elevators worked in a timely fashion half the time we were there but a big plus is the stairs are easy to find.\n\nThe hotel restaurant is not a place we would recommend eating at considering the many, many other options within just a few blocks of the hotel.

They need to update the room service menus in the rooms, however they were very quick to bring me a new one so I could order that toe-warming dinner.

Starbucks is just off the lobby, and there's a restaurant on the other side (but we didn't use that). Sam's Diner across the road was good for breakfast and dinner with good food and excellent service, but otherwise the choice locally is very limited. My only criticism of this hotel is the location. It is a good walk back to the main shops along a wide sidewalk but where not everybody would feel 100% comfortable - not that bad but it was certainly noticeable that there were more destitute people on the streets than when I was in SF two years ago. So you may prefer to get a taxi to the bigger shops or for the better restaurants, but there were always taxis outside the hotel and during the day you can easily walk to the Nordstrom shopping centre, Macey*s and everywhere else if you like walking (and shopping). As an example of the hotel's attention to guests I'd say this: I emailed them beforehand to check the reservation and mentioned we were arriving on my son's 20th birthday, they put balloons, a sign and a delicious little pudding in the room for our arrival. He was cross with me of course for saying anything, but also rather chuffed; thanks to Tim, the reservations manager, for that.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Devon UK","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-02-17T10:55:05Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"22510","reviewId":"18524847","photos":[],"itinId":"305358931","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":1,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Roger","brandType":"Expedia","title":"\"Awful Hotel that is not needed\"","reviewText":"This Hotel needs a definite upgrade.

Our son's apartment was 1 BART stop away and he readily got together with us for touring, and enjoying excellent meals, whether from a pleasant and inexpensive diner (Sam's Diner) across from the Whitcomb, to delicious seafood and ethnic meals at Fisherman's Wharf, Chinatown, the Mission District, and event a bit north in Muir Beach during our 1/2-day rental car trip up to Muir Woods (redwood trees!).

It is an interesting old building which was one of the few to survive the 1906 earthquake. The trolley bus on the “F-line” stops right outside the hotel - very convenient because it takes you directly to Fisherman’s Wharf. However, the immediate area on Market Street has a lot of street people, and it is somewhat unsettling for walking after dark. I would stay at the Whitcomb again if I was in San Francisco for another concert, but if I was there purely as a tourist I would stay in the Fisherman’s Wharf area because that is where there is so much to see, it seems very safe, and there are lots of great restaurants.\nThe hotel itself is very well run and the bellboy staff in particular were really helpful. It has an adjacent Starbucks with an entrance directly from the lobby so that one does not need to go outside for one’s morning coffee. (My room had no coffee machine.) There are a couple of diners across the street so meals during daytime present no difficulty. Dinner is more problematical. There is a restaurant, again accessible from the hotel lobby, which could perhaps be best described as a “would-be upscale Chinese restaurant.” I ate there the first night but did not like it much; my waiter seemed snobby and I found it quite expensive. After the first night, I had dinner at the restaurants at Fisherman’s Wharf and returned to the hotel on the F-line trolley bus.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Peachland, British Columbia","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-12-20T20:57:50Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"22510","reviewId":"18524899","photos":[],"itinId":"301870282","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Barbara","brandType":"Expedia","title":"A Wonderful Surprise!","reviewText":"I selected the hotel for its location, read the other reviews.

We were just blocks from the Embarcadero and trolleys to Fisherman's Wharf, blocks from the high-end shopping district, and the trolley up Market Street was fun. Chase had a branch on one corner and Walgreen's was on the other, for all the convenience we needed.\n\nYou don't need a car for this hotel but there is a parking garage in back with typical downtown fees.

We looked into moving but would have had to give up about 1/3 of our space and because the room was smaller would have had to turn the air conditioning on which would have made it noisy once again! The room was nice but the bathrooms definately need some work. No counter space or a place to put anything. There is no t.v. unless you pay, you have to ask for a coffeee maker. . The maids never emptied the coffee maker or gave us clean cups. They rinsed them in the bathroom sink I think. If you want a fridge it'll cost you $20.oo a day. we said no and I just \"borrowed a little milk from Starbucks downstairs each day! One or two of the four elevators broke down one day (right when there was a huge German tour bus in), so we used the stairs. The front staff were all nice and helpful with the exception of a short mustachioed man who was a grump.

Unfortunetely they try to be a four star hotel but not hard enough to actually be one. In the process they seem to miss some of the basics you'd expect from a two or three star. An example would be, when we arrived the room only had the one partial roll of tp that was on the dispenser, with no extra. When we requested extra they brought one roll. Next day after housekeeping still just the one roll on the dispenser. Expedia reservation was for a king room we were given the last queen they had otherwise would have gotten a double. Disappointed with the bar staff and beverage selection so we didn't try the restaurant.

It truly was not what we were expecting. The period details really made us feel like we were stepping back in time. We were able to relax and enjoy our stay. The doorman and front desk staff greeted us with smiles and were very nice. Everyone seemed to enjoy themselves. The hallways in the hotel even made us feel like we had gone back in time. It was vert relaxing. Our room faced Market Street, and we had an amazing view of the city. This hotel left a positive impression with us.

The amenities as the same/standard as low/medium priced hotels. The outlet in the bathroom was broken, so the staff brought in an extension cord. The service was pretty good in general, however, their wireless access was abysmal. The service they use was down 90% of the time and the helpdesk would state \"at least 24 hrs\" whenever we called. For a place like San Francisco, this was an unexpected and unwelcome surprise. As a side note- I didn't mind staying at the Ramada (wireless aside), since I had lived in SF and know the area, but if you are unfamiliar with San Francisco, this hotel is not in the best area. They do have security inside the door and there is a BART (subway) enterance just outside the front door, which was nice. Rumor has it, the hotel has been acquired and is somehow turning into a boutique hotel in the spring, with the same rates as 5 star hotels. We will see what happens, but due to the location and state of rooms/amenities, they will have a hard time getting guests with high rates.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Portsmouth, NH","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-02-14T21:16:49Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"22510","reviewId":"18525549","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":2,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"shihab","brandType":"Expedia","title":"OK","reviewText":"Hotel is not in very good area, but I guess downtown is a bit not safe.

Also, the curtains didn't close, so impossible to maintain privacy or block out daylight. But the location is excellent and although the neighbourhood is somewhat down at heel, it seemed safe enough.

Standing squarely in front of the window and looking out treated us to a view on the outside wall of the Fairmont Hotel across the street. I felt ripped off. The room also faced California street and even thought we were on the floor below the top, we had to hear the noise of the tracks at night.  The rooms are small and somewhat dated.

It kind of fails at both. It's not a good place for business travelers. The place feels faded, my room was tiny and scuffed up with what felt like remaindered furniture from the 1990's.  Less than half the TV channels worked. The hallway carpeting was filthy in many places.  Noise penetrates the room easily.  Most astonishing, there's really no restaurant.  The breakfast in the lobby bar is a thoroughly mediocre, over-priced buffet with a handful of choices. I didn't even dare try the dinner in the same location, which had only 3 or 4 entrees anyway.  There's no lunch -- it's clearly a tourist-oriented hotel that assumes everyone will be out pretty much all the time.  Valet parking is very expensive and very slow. The staff is pleasant.

The two things that we didn't like about the hotel was that we noticed a weird smell when we first checked in, an overly sweet smell that was probably a cleaning agent. It wasn't unpleasant, just a weird smell that we weren't anticipating. The other issue was the shower - it was an older shower and the shower head was weirdly low -- only someone 5 feet or under would be able to actually stand under the shower. Since my husband and I are 5'9\" and 5'8\", that was a bit of an issue. The shower head wasn't adjustable so we weren't able to take a normal shower. \r\n\r\nThose are pretty minor items, though, because the room itself was very comfortable and the neighborhood was so convenient. There was a cable car stop right outside of the hotel that went downtown which was very convenient.

It was obvious, no one had been up there in a very long time to check out the condition of the room, other than the housekeeping staff to give it a clean once a day, and not a very thorough one at that. There were spots on the carpet, food stains on the seat and dust on the base of the desk chair, the piping around the top-edge of the ottoman was tattered from age and wear, there were fingerprints and stains all over the front of the dresser/credenza/refrigerator unit and there was black (not grey) mildew along the grout on the top of the soap holder in the tub and more mildew in the tile grouting in the shower/tub. Does no one ever inspect those rooms? Then, upon pulling down the duvet, found a small, grey, sticky spot stuck to the bottom sheet.  When housekeeper came up to change the sheet as requested, she had a surly,insulted attitude and challenged me about the spot! Unbelievable! And try to reach the hotel from outside.

There is food service in the lobby, but only at certain hours. When we went for ice, the freezer was empty. Other than for a short time late on Sat. evening, the hall was quiet. The only negative thing occurred when I had to extend my stay. The rate I was quoted was double what I had been paying. They were able to negotiate with me and a better rate was secured. It was still higher than what I would normally pay for a hotel but I didn't want to have to seek out a new hotel for 2 nights. I would definitely return to this hotel again at the sale price. I have to compliment the friendliness and caring attitude of the staff. Everyone we encountered was pleasant and willing to help. I would have given it an excellent rating in every category if they had honored my previous rate for the 2 extra nights. I felt the circumstances were unique.

After the first night, I called the manager on duty, who agreed to switch us to a quieter room if we would just pack up everything before we headed out for the day.  We spent half an hour to pack, but when we got back, our room was not changed.  We were told that if we insisted on moving, it would be to a much smaller room.  \r\n\r\nI asked them why they did not tell us about the room size before telling us to pack my stuff.

The hotel decor in the lobby is modern; but the room decor is a bit lacking.  Our room was so dark; a lamp near the beds would've helped tremendously.  Room cleanliness was lacking.  The pocket door to the toilet/tub area was disgusting with splatters (I don't even want to know), so it didn't seem that housekeeping was overly meticulous.  One day, housekeeping left us with only a tiny bit of toilet paper (I had to steal a roll from the housekeeping cart); another day, housekeeping didn't clean the room at all.  Returning late in the evening to unmade beds, trash remaining in the cans, and barely enough towels for the night did NOT make us happy.  Check-in felt a bit disorganized, as well.  Granted, we arrived early for check-in (1:00 or so), but the attendant at the desk said we could check into a room.  Unfortunately, she took so long (perhaps computers aren't her thing?) that another couple arrived at the desk to check-in and went up to their room.  That same couple passed us still at the counter as they left to go explore the city.  Then we were told that no rooms were available.  That required checking our luggage, of course.  Very frustrating for a first impression, to say the least.

We took the room without a view - fine with us because it was quiet.

Finally they told me that they had overbooked so they needed to put me in a handicapped room because that's all they had available.

The ironing board in my room was very shaky so I asked them to replace it the very first day but was never replaced. I had a restaurant charge on my bill when checking out, and I never ate in the hotel restaurant; the front desk person was able to confirm and take it off.\n\nGood stay overall!\n\nMy favourite part about this hotel was the location and the gym. Its a nice little gym with some cardio equipment and free weights. The location is as convenient as it gets.

When my husband went down to change rooms , the woman was very nice and found a lovely room. When we went to get keys, the machine was down and had to wait for someone to let us in our room. They were able to give us keys later, but the staff person laughed when he inquired on why we changed rooms! The other room was much nicer. We stayed for 5 nights. It was fine after that but I'm wondering if a hotel knows you are staying a number of nights, why would they place you in a smaller, noisier room.\nI realize that this is a transitional stage for the hotel and the staff seemed quite frustrated.

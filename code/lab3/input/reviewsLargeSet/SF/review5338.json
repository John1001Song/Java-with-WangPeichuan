We walked just about everywhere we needed to be.  The hotel staff were very kind and accommodating. We parked just a block behind the hotel, however when we went to pick up our vehicle on the last day there were an enormous amount of people waiting there for rentals and pickups.  One of the hotel deskmen had walked up to the garage, saw us standing there after checking out and offered to hold our bags for us until we could pick up our vehicle later that day (which was the plan anyways).   I found that one small gesture from the hotel staff to be so wonderfully kind and considerate of our time.  The hotel was clean and well kept, the bathrooms are insanely small and the shower is a bit hard to maneuver in due to the tight space but nonetheless it was clean and served it's purpose.  We were able to enjoy the 5pm wine tasting which was a great way to unwind.  The TV sets in the rooms are a little outdated - while they are flat screens there were no place for a USB plug.  Also, there was only one outlet to use to charge our phone and it was on the other side of the room under the desk.

The same problem happened the next night so we did not sleep well! The room was clean and linens were fresh but generally the hotel needs a good clean. The banister rail on the stairs between the ground and second floor is sticky and black with grime! In contrast to the reception staff member, the guest services man was very helpful and courteous. The cost of the room was not cheap and I do not consider it was good value for money or lived up to expectations based on criteria published by Expedia. I travel a lot and very rarely am dissatisfied or find a need to complain. I am not looking for luxury.

Upon checking in to our room on the third floor we noticed a strong dog smell in the corridor as well as in our room. Later in the evening after returning from dinner the smell was overwhelming so we asked if we could transfer to another room. Chris at the hotel reception was both helpful and friendly and we transferred that night. Apparently floors 2 and 3 are pet friendly while floor 5 where we moved wasnt. The room we moved to was comfortable however we could both still smell animals had been in the room. We didn't ask to move again because it seems that the entire hotel has an unpleasant odor.

You can walk from Powell Bart station to the hotel (20 mins) although there is a steep slope for about one block. You can find Vito's pizza and Walgreens Pharmacy near by. \r\nThere are 2 Walgreens on Powell St near the hotel. The one that is closer to Union Square/Macy is much bigger and you can buy bottle water, coffee and sandwiches. It opens 24 hrs a day. The cable car is only 50 yards at Powell and Bush St. China town is also within walking distance.\r\n\r\nThe hotel staff was quite friendly and let us store our luggage after we checked out so that we could go to Market St to see the St. Patrick's day Parade.\r\n\r\nCons - Hotel is over 100 years old. The first room we got on the 4th floor was old, smelly and had some flies( looks like fruit flies) in the bath room. We asked for a change and was assigned one on the 8th floor. The room looked like it was recently updated and very clean.\r\nThe air conditioner (window unit) is quite noisy. Luckily we did not have to turn it on during sleep. Otherwise I don't think you can sleep with the noise. In addition, our section can clearly hear the noise from garbage trunks at around 6 am. If that bothers you, you may want to ask for the quiet side of the building when you book.\r\nSince this is an old hotel, the in-room safe is on the shelf inside the closet.

What should have been a dresser below the TV was instead a low closet containing one shelf over a safe. The safe could have been put in the clothes closet with a full dresser substituting for this cabinet. Also, I think the \"extra cost\" food and drink items in the room were overdone.

You can get tours and day trips with pickups and drop offs in front of the hotel through extranomical and grayline which was a great option for a solo traveler! A taxi ride to and from the San Francisco airport is around $50! There is also a shuttle you can get to and from called \"go-lorries\" for only $14!

On two occasions, I have been told to speak with the Booking manager in the next day. When I came back to reception, the response I got was unsympathetic; all the previous smiles suddenly seemed superficial. I was asked if I was going to pay up for the extra night (since this was a very busy New Year’s night!!!), instead I checked out! 1. The Hotel has 3 stars; don’t expect a 5 star service!\nIf you are the kind of customer who would be annoyed by small things going wrong, then probably you should consider elsewhere.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"Value for money (except busy nights!).

I didn't get a chance to go into the hotel restaurant. My only complaint: on my last night, I called the front desk regarding a wake-up call and requesting a late check-out time. Only a voicemail answered, as the person wasn't there, so I left a complete message.

Nice staff. I had asked for a room NOT on Bush St since I am a light sleeper. However, they had assigned me a room on Bush St, which looked very nice. I complained and they switched me to a room off Bush (a bit smaller, but quieter) and apologized.\n2. Generally nice room.\n3. Nice shower with a lot of high pressure water.\n4. Great location.\n5. Free apples and other refreshments in the lobby (I only got the apples)\n6. Masa's restaurant is there. Expensive, but it's supposed to be very good. I did not try it.\nNegatives:\n1. Very noisy, if you are on Bush. Some people don't care. I do.\n2. Blinds do not block light at all. Luckily, I was on UK time, so I would get up around 5:30, just as the sun was coming up.\n3. Weird, unpleasant smell in the room. As if there had been a not so clean dog in there (I don't think there was a dog, but that how it smelled like). You get used to it, but each time you get back into the room it hits you again. Not good if you invite over a friend. I had read this comment before on Expedia, and it is definitely true (I was in room 611).\n4. Lobby looks rather shabby, but there is a fireplace.\n5. It is rather tricky to get a cab at times on Bus.

I can tell our room was not checked in for awhile because after 1 day with the ac and fan on, most of the smell went away by the 2nd night.

The room also includes a power bar where you can plug in your cell phone, iPhone, camera, etc to re-charge batteries. This is something I rarely see but was much appreciated.\n\nHighly recommend you pick up a one or three day cable car / MUNI pass for $14 or $21. It gives you on/off privileges for just about everything except BART - only place I've ever seen it available is at the booth just outside Powell Street BART/MUNI station. Considering the cable cars are $6 one way and MUNI goes just about everywhere, this is a great deal.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Edmoton, AB","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-09-12T21:00:42Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"4","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_ca","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5338","reviewId":"18492077","photos":[],"itinId":"379950746","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"4105","userNickname":"Patricia","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Good hotel for a decent price","reviewText":"Some molding in the bathroom but overall nice hotel to stay in.

The area was fairly close to where I needed to be each day. I'm not used to the hills in San Francisco and with all the weight I was carrying it was fairly convenient to have a stayed close to downtown. Catching the trolly was really easy and convenient because it stopped right at the intersection which was not more than 20 feet away. Leaving a mess after I rushed each morning to applying make-up, I was extremely surprised at how well they cleaned the bathroom area. The hotel was very accommodating in storing my luggage as well on the day of my check out allowing me to do a little site seeing on my last day.\n\nCons: I didn't have an incredible view, but I was only there to sleep, shower and relax after a long day of walking so it didn't really matter to me. On the week of my stay, there was construction or repaving of the street outside the hotel which made it almost impossible to catch a cab and detoured a lot of people from even attempting to drive down the street. The Hotel is on a one way street so there would be many times where drivers would have to drive around the block to get to the hotel and it would cost me a dollar extra. When I would mention the name of the hotel to many people, Cab drivers, shuttles, tour buses drivers, no one would know what I was talking about, and I had to start stating the address each time I had to get to my destination.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Albany, NY","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-09-06T14:53:16Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5338","reviewId":"18491807","photos":[],"itinId":"386427787","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Theresa","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great place to visit.","reviewText":"Very well kept older hotel in the heart of San Francisco.

Where do I begin with how disappointed I am in this place. Well, it was my 6th wedding anniversary, so I thought to get a room next to the fancy restaurant Masa's. This way we didn't need to worry about driving after celebrating. Anyhow, We were barely greeted at the front desk. We get our room, but there was no heat. I understand that they need to air out the room, but it was freezing. So, that was not a great impact. Naturally we checked the heaters which did not turn on, so we called. My request was ignored by a walk through fix over the phone, and then I was told that the heaters take about 5-10 minutes to turn on. After insisting that someone comes to look at the heaters, the house-man gets there to review the phone instructions with me, all which I had to decipher through his broken English. He saw that the heaters were not working, so he offered to come back with a space heater. 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes go by and no space heater, so I call the front desk again. Turns out the maintenance man left for the night, his shift was over. Right, so I re-request a space heater, but turns out the maintenance man is the ONLY guy in the building who has a key to the special space-heater closet. Ok, so I go down stairs to the front desk and vent a little, while asking for extra blankets. Nope, no extra blankets in the room, as they normally would be, and none that the front desk could offer. All this BS while our dinner reservation is 10 minutes away.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":2,"ratingHotelCondition":1,"ratingService":1,"ratingRoomComfort":1,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"palo alto","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-12-08T20:58:50Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"25","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_au","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5338","reviewId":"18492005","photos":[],"itinId":"1624998","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"3081","userNickname":"Rae","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Vintage Court as a relaxing and enjoyable 'home' to stay in whilst in San Francisco.","reviewText":"From the moment we arrived late in the afternoon we found Vintage Court a welcoming place to stay.

The fact that every room carries the name of a winery or wine made it feel personal, and also the wine tasting time between 5 and 6pm where you met other travellers to discuss your day was a pleasant experience.

The hotel is vintage and it's well preserved in my opinion. It's not big on space but it has lots of character and charm. We were very pleased with the friendly staff.

Taxi to the Fisherman Wharf area was about $10 which is reasonable and could save you the cost of renting a car and worrying about parking if only there for the weekend.

The hotel was small and intimate, and was generally very clean. The bathroom sink had some cracks, but overall, the room was in good shape. I had read that the streets could be noisy at night and early in the morning, but I always travel with a sound machine, so that pretty much drowned out any traffic or garbage trucks. A key feature is that the hotel is walking distance to the cable car stop, Union Square and Chinatown. One day we even decided to walk to Fisherman's Wharf, which turned out to be about a 25 minute walk, mostly downhill. Another key factor was safety, and I felt completely safe in the neighborhood, even when arriving back later in the evening. A nice touch is the free wine tasting from 5:30- 6:30pm every evening. Since we were sightseeing most of the time, we only made it back for one wine tasting (just for me, not my son!), and it was a nice social scene, with hotel guests mingling. I would absolutely return to this hotel and would recommend it to others.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"New York, NY","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-08-18T18:37:44Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Families","categoryLabel":"Families"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5338","reviewId":"18492291","photos":[],"itinId":"327482091","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":2,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"deborah","brandType":"Expedia","title":"disappointed in dc","reviewText":"The hotel was very worn. the faucet for the shower fell off during a shower, which made it non functional. we were able to figure out how to stick it back on.\ncleanliness of the rooms was mediocare. front desk people were nice and responsive.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":2,"ratingHotelCondition":1,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":1,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"DC","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-08-18T15:27:25Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Families","categoryLabel":"Families"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"25","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_au","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5338","reviewId":"18491811","photos":[],"itinId":"1459197","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"3081","userNickname":"Lyn","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great location","reviewText":"Hotel is very conveniently located, close to Union Square, etc and is clean and tidy.

Wine tasting was ok wine wise but great to meet and greet other hotel guests. Cable care stops at the top of Pine and it is downhill to the front door or save your energy for one big stair climb off the beginning of the tunnel on Stockton. A great convenience store across the street and Uncle Vito's on the corner of Powell and Pine is great for Italian fare. An easy walk to Union Square and shopping and of course Lefty O'Doul's for lunch. Get a 7 day MUNI pass and use the cable car to go uphill! If you are a senior buy a monthly bus pass at the cable car stop Union Square for $15.00! A great way to get around San Francisco - Fisherman's Wharf, Chinatown, the Zoo or anywhere. Vintage Court is very central and you can also walk to many places easily.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Southwest Saskatchewan","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-03-18T23:16:46Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5338","reviewId":"18492067","photos":[],"itinId":"310620917","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Frank","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Average hotel if you're on a budget.","reviewText":"Safe and fairly clean 3 star hotel with nice staff and an awesome restaurant attached to it (Massa's).

The location of the hotel was outstanding, the staff excellent and the room itself more than adequate. We were quite high up in the hotel so had some natural light. Yes we could hears the bins being empty early some mornings, yep there was some street noise, but seriously people, you are staying in a city, if you don't want normal city sounds then stay in the country.\n\nYou literally have a cable car at your door to jump on. make sure you buy a muni pass, otherwise one small trip costs you $5.\n\nThe room did have a slight musty odour when we first arrived but after a quick spray of room freshner and leaving the windows open for some fresh air everything was fine in no time.\n\nVincent, at the front desk was fantastic, friendly and lovely and it felt like you were greeting a friend everytime you came in and out of the hotel.\n\nDon't count on the wine reception though, if you're from Oz and enjoy wine you'll be disappointed in the quality, and it can get quite busy so hard to sit down.\n\nMy only other comment would be to probably avoid the mini bar. Ours looked like it hadn't been updated for about 10 years.\n\nAlso try the Mexican bar/restaurant on the corner, especially on Tuesdays when drinks are half priced. Cheap Dos Equis beers and best beef bean dip I've ever had make a very happy hour or three.\n\nAlso try Mel's diner for THE BEST CHEESEBURGER I'VE EVER EATEN!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Melbourne, Australia","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-01-06T06:12:57Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"3","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_gb","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5338","reviewId":"18492090","photos":[],"itinId":"21281551","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"2057","userNickname":"Catherine","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Hotel is fine","reviewText":"Everything was fine except for the absence of advertised continental breakfast.

Next plus is the location, conveniently located in Union Square, you can walk to most places. The main entrance to Chinatown is 2 blocks away. One block in the other direction is Powell Street where the historical trolley has a stop. For places further away, like Fishermnan's Wharf and Ghirdelli Square, catch the trolley at Powell St. or it is a short walk to Market to catch the \"F\" cable car. Other amenties include a small continental breakfast (pastries, muffins, coffee and tea) each morning between 7am and 9am and wine tasting in the evening between 5pm and 6pm. Note: the wine reception does not offer any snacks. If you bring a car, the valet service at the hotel is very prompt and efficient. Lastly, the rooms are adequate, nothing fancy, remember this is an older hotel and small rooms are the norm. If your idea of a vaction is to lounge around in your room, you will be disappointed.

In order to give a chic appearance the beds are adorned with cushions of geometric shapes, but as these had to be removed to use the bed the appeal of the chicness is lost when one was faced with the problem of where to store the cushions in the cupboard of a room so that one didn't trip over them getting out of bed.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Northampton","reviewSubmissionTime":"2006-08-16T14:46:17Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5338","reviewId":"18491954","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Edwards","brandType":"Expedia","title":"2nd visit","reviewText":"great spot, wine at 5 so you meet other guests & share best restaurants, attractions,etc","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Vancouver,BC, Canada","reviewSubmissionTime":"2006-08-09T02:23:20Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5338","reviewId":"18491952","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Pat","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great location, mediocre facilities","reviewText":"This is a great location, half a block from the cable car and 2 blocks from Union Square.

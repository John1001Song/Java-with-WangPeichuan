This hotel/extended stay is approximately 35 min. from SF (with light traffic). The location is  great, free wifi, no parking fees, located close to many stores and restaurants and it is an all around great stay. We never expected to like the hotel and chose it because we knew we would be spending very little time there and we found we liked it better than the hotels where we typically stay in SF. There is a full refrigerator, microwave, great view of the water, the beds were very comfortable and they have (free continental breakfast) excellent coffee brewing, hot tea, water for oatmeal, oranges, apples, muffins and breakfast bars at not cost from 6:00 a.m. - 9:30 a.m. The facility is not fancy but it is very clean and instead of having a $1000.00+ bill for three days our total bill was $315! There is housekeeping only if you stay eight or more days and you have to turn towels into the front for new supplies/towels, and although we had never been without housekeeping on a daily basis we found we liked the privacy.

They claimed that the elevators would be working by Friday (this was a Wednesday), but they were still not working when we left on Saturday.  Several trips up and down three flights of stairs carrying all our luggage made me swear to never deal with this chain again.  The clerks were never available at the front desk and you had to yell to get their attention while they hung out in the office with closed doors.  They have not one single ice machine on any floor or anywhere on the premises.  When you did speak with them they were rude and could care less about your concerns.  Their claim to have free breakfasts was a joke.  A four foot long table with 2 coffee pots (both caffeinated) and a pot of hot water and creamer and a couple of muffins, no juice, cereal or milk would not even qualify as a Continental Breakfast yet they called it \"Free Breakfast\".  Broken light switch in room required unscrewing light bulb to turn it off.  Our last night there, a group of very young people checked in next to us and were extremely noisy.

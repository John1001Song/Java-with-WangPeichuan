There are homeless people honestly anywhere you go in San Fran - one street is good then another is a tad shady.  We were not bothered by any of them right by the hotel.  A minor downside to the hotel is the elevator.  As the hotel has an older feel which I really liked, the elevator is quite tiny and very slow which can be a negative if you have a big group or lots of luggage or are older.

We tried to open the window to get some fresh air but the window of the room was located really close to a furnace exhaust for a restaurant that was open 24 hours so all the smell of food was around us and entered the room because the windows are old and they don't shot well. So don't expect to breathe any fresh air while in your room. The room was clean and they use some extra freshener trying to combat the smell of food in the room. Also I encountered another issue with the valet parking. When I picked up my car to leave the hotel it was smelling full of smoke. Also we detected a small ash residue on the dashboard so on my trip back home I got to inhale plenty of that smoke. The hotel knew about the situation but they decided not to inform us about the situation. Good luck with this hotel if you want to breathe air with fried chicken smell combined. Also be careful who parks your car also. Definitely a bad experience that I learned from it.\r\n","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"The location is good because it is in walking distance to Union Square and Cable car. \r\n ","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-01-03T16:19:53Z","roomTypeId":200985221,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"hotelId":"14451","reviewId":"5685d0db710ec76a974be606","photos":[],"itinId":"1123380409350","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"MMA","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"","reviewText":"Worth the price.

Within a few short blocks, there are Chinese, Indian, Thai, American and other eateries that offer a wonderful variety of food.  The hotel itself dates from the early 1900's, but it is well-maintained and nicely decorated.  The beds were comfortable with thick mattresses.  The bathroom is old-fashioned and a bit small. The bathtub shower had a high side that could prove difficult for older people or those who have knee problems to get in.  My companion and I had a twin room and it was not a big room, so possibly the double-double or queen room would be bigger.  But it was large enough for us. Our main complaint was that they had one small elevator for the guests and in two days there we found it filled with hotel staff and workmen on several occasions and needed to wait for it to go down and up again.  That's a minor problem though and for the cost and location of this hotel, this was a great buy.

I was surprised at how expensive some Airbnb rooms were while searching for similar locations, which made my decision to stay at King George that much easier for a small additional cost. \r\n\r\nWhile I was only visiting San Francisco on holiday and not business, I cannot say how I would rate all of the facilities at this hotel, but for a single traveler the experience was very pleasant and welcoming.

My room had no AC, but it had a ceiling fan, so it was comfortable for September. I don't know about summer months when it's hotter, but some rooms do have AC.

The free wifi and fixed rate parking with in-and-out privileges helped to keep our trip to SF on budget.

Every single person we encountered on the staff was extremely courteous, knowledgeable and helpful.  Major shopping a block away.  Upon checkout I mentioned how much we enjoyed our stay and that we would be back, and if there were anything I would change it would the the hobo that smoked in the alley that caused cigarette smoke smell to drift into our room.

My only complaint was that the bathroom was tiny and did not have any room at the sink to put on makeup, etc. The beds, though comfortable, were smaller twin size beds, and my feet went over the edge. Our room was sort of towards the side/back of the hotel and we had no problem with street noise or noise coming from other rooms - it was quiet even though the hotel was booked up that weekend. This hotel is close to EVERYTHING! Many places to eat and shop surround this hotel. You can walk to Nordstrom and Macy's. Parking is across the street and pricey, though this is San Francisco so that is to be expected. My advice is to take the underground trains/yellow cable cars, which are inexpensive and run nearly constantly. You don't want to drive.

A steam iron and ironing board were offered. The bathroom was tiny: sink, bathtub, shower and commode in a very small area. I lost my balance and fell in the tight space. Hot water was at least 3-4 minutes away. When it get hot it was very adequate and steady temperature wise. A horrible waste of a precious resource in the west. The staircase to the lobby was a tricky to navigate spiral. The outside fire escape was also painted multiple times and the paint was chipping off.

The rooms are very small and for two people we were tripping over each other and our stuff. The walls and doors are very thin, you can hear everything that is going on in the room next to you. Last but not least, the windows are horrible. They were probably installed before I was born. They are very thin and you can hear everything going on in the street. Which leads me to probably one of the most interesting points of my trip. Across the way, protesters gather outside the Hotel Frank and scream on bullhorns for one hour each morning (700am-800am). It has to do with an ongoing labor dispute at that hotel, and while this has nothing to do with the King George you can still count on being woken up everything morning at 7am on the dot.

The front desk did advise me to simply use the phone by the elevator next time and they would send someone up. Definitely a positive action but still not a resolution. More frustrating was the scalding to ice cold shower if used after 7:00am. Moving the handle did not affect any change. This single issue set the tone for the stay and likely would be a deal breaker for future reservations. There is only one small elevator and this was not totally unexpected given the age of the building. The challenge was the only other method of acending/decending was an extremely tight spiral stairway. Staying on the 7th floor this was not a real viable option.

But there are several items that could be of concern for some. There are no ice machines nor are there fridges or microwaves in the room. Also, most rooms tend to be on the small side as is the single elevator. The stairway is in a spiral which can be somewhat uncomfortable to negotiate for older clientele. Otherwise, you'll find that the location allows for 24/7 food and other services, and great public transport throughout the Bay Area.

When we arrived, the vallet area was completing blocked so we had to park in front of the restuarant next door and pay a meter so anticipate heavy traffic in that area (you are in SF!). I realized that the valet parks your car in a parking garage a few blocks away so make sure you don't leave any valuables in the car & it cost $30 for parking! And when you leave it might take awhile because they have to go get your car so again, anticipate a wait. The staff was very friendly upon arrival, checkin was a breeze. However, the elevator to our room was the slowest and smallest I have ever been in (it literally only fits 2 people). Our room was very small but clean. We didn't have a veiw but we did have all the necessary amenities that all hotels should provide, in-room safe, hair dryer, free wifi, a comfortable bed, and a tv. The bathroom was extremely small and there was only hot water. In addition, the hotel is close to good shopping and restuarants- there is even a 24 hour diner a couple doors down and the Mason Restuarant next door was good. However, if you leave your hotel at night (we went to watch Wicked at 8pm at the Orpheum) be weary of walking down Mason Street and stick to Market at night. We made that mistake and it was the shadiest street ever. Overall, the hotel was decent.

One of the best traits is that they recycle and use biodegradable shampoo bottles.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Portland, OR","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-05-06T15:43:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"14451","reviewId":"18631826","photos":[],"itinId":"266327540","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Chris","brandType":"Expedia","title":"King George Hotel is a good deal","reviewText":"I stayed at the King George during my recent trip to San Francisco for four nights. The room was very nice, bed comfortable and shower TERRIFIC. I must say I was overly satisfied with the room in general and especially with the shower head. Not having proper pressure is a BIG pet-peeve of mine and The King George Hotel satisfied my showering needs 100%. The only negative thing I could say about the hotel is that there is a gap of several inches between the floor and the door of the room that allowed for \"some\" noise to be heard once in a while from the hallway. But, it was only occasionally and not long-lasting. This is just a side effect of old architecture. The walls are rather thin, but if you are a heavy sleeper or carry earplugs with you, I think you will be fine.

Everything was very clean and the staff was quite helpful. The room appeared to be recently painted, and carpet, bedspread, drapes and other furnishings were in good shape. Lots of hot water and good water pressure. The room was small - so small that I almost wished the upholstered chair wasn't there (in addition to a desk chair), but it was fine for one person. Having only one small elevator is a potential problem, but there was only 1 or two times all week that I had to wait. My only real complaint was that when I had a question about the wireless service, the front desk told me to call a helpline. The helpline person quickly solved my problem, but I used my room phone to call (since I had used it to call the front desk) instead of my cell and they charged me a \"connection fee.\" I should have used my cell, but I wasn't thinking about potential charges. I wish the front desk had reminded me about the connection fee when they told me to call.

The hotel is located downtown in the Tenderloin which is urban and gritty but not menacing. The hotel was most likely once a SRO rooming house that was renovated with style. Rather than totally destroying the key elements of the hotel's past the designers chose to save them and enhance them. The original wood doors to the rooms are preserved and brightly painted. The original exposed electric conduits in the hallways are saved with pleasant designer fixtures added to them. I'm sure that this is not for everyone. If you want an attractive price on a hotel that was purposefully designed to preserve its heritage then this is for you. The cable cars to Fishermans Wharf are a five minute walk. The BART to the airport(40 minutes to the international terminal) is a two minute walk. High end shopping on Post Street is less than a ten minute walk. I proudly walked up Nob Hill which begins just steps from the hotel. Nice restaurants nearby. My favorite was a sushi bar that had the food floating by your table on boats in a minuture elevated stream. The staff was courteous. I slept with the windows open and it can get noisy at night if you do that. However, it is no trouble for anyone used to sleeping in a city. Free WiFi. They let me keep the bicycle I rented to explore the city in my room. When the conference room is not used they allow you to keep bicycles there. I like this place and would be happy to stay again on my next trip to San Francisco.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"New York City","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-09-28T06:38:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"14451","reviewId":"18632012","photos":[],"itinId":"240762070","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"R","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Best Boutique Hotel in San Francisco","reviewText":"We just spent 9 wonderful days at the King George Hotel, a quaint but comfortable boutique hotel, conveniently located a block from SF's Union Square.

There are some nice restaurants as well as inexpensive cafes surrounding the hotel. There is a good variety of Continental as well as Asian/SE Asian restaurants nearby. The ACT and Curran theatres are located right around the corner from the hotel. Free wireless internet access in the room, free in room coffee and free fresh apples at the front desk were a few of the ammenities we enjoyed. WE also likws the reasonably priced continental breakfast which was available daily in a quaint Victorian setting. The King George is like a home away from home; we loved the ambiance, cleanliness, and most of all, the excellent service offered by the entire hotel staff; therefore, we have already booked another stay at the hotel when we return to SF in 8 weeks.

Soon after we called the police, we realized my brand new, Sony laptop was also stolen from my room. All in all, I lost 4 bottles of wine, a laptop, a laptop charger, designer sunglasses, and my car keys (thank god I didn't have my car or that may have been gone, too!) And don't think the hotel tried to do anything to compensate us either. We had to file a police report and thank god my renter's insurance is covering my loss. After all was said and done, the hotel basically said the theft was our fault for \"leaving our room door open\" because any rational and intelligent human being would leave their hotel room door open for anyone to come in and steal their personal belongings.

A nice surprise was the British tea served on flowered china on Sats. and Suns., with an array of tea sandwiches and sweets and a large pot of tea with many flavors to choose from. Not for those who love a crowd, but charming nonetheless. You're also within easy reach of tons of car rental places. and can return the car across the street.

To be honest we were a little worried after reading previous reviews but as soon as we arrived we knew we had made the right choice. Staff are excellent, most helpful. Rooms are comfortable, ok they are not huge but more than adequate and very clean. If I had to be picky and put something negative I would say that the bar should be open longer hours. Currently it only opens 5-10pm which is a shame. Also it only stocks beers and wines so if you dont like either you are stuffed. Location is fab, couldnt have asked for better. The Diners either side of the hotel do some great food, whether it be breakfast or dinner. The Concierge has some 20% discount vouchers available for both upon request. Only downside to San Fran is the amount of homeless people begging on the streets. We did have one scary incident when we were harrassed and followed back to the hotel by a couple of homeless guys - the concierge had to get rid of them. This was our third trip to San Fran, we have previously stayed in one dearer/higher classed hotel and another that was on a par with the King George - the King George was by far the best and we will definitely be coming back.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"London","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-03-30T09:35:16Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"14451","reviewId":"18632221","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"David","brandType":"Expedia","title":"King George review","reviewText":"We stayed at the KG for two nights in early March 2007.

There is no A/C, the only way to cool the room is by opening the window, and however, there are two dilemmas with that 1. The street noise; and 2. The next-door restaurant vent is right next to the hotel and your room will smell like fried chicken all the time. All old and uneven walls, doors and trims seemed freshly painted. Also, rooms are equipped with an old steam cast iron radiator heating system. Bathroom: The most amazing part of my stay was to figure our how they were able to fit a bathtub, toilet, and a sing in such small area. They were all there and all functional despite the fact that they seemed like they were the original fixtures from when the hotel was originally build in the early 1900s. Hotel: The hotel is equipped with one small elevator that could hold up to 4 average size people. The elevator seemed functional and safe. In general the common areas are in fair shape.

The rooms are small as you would expect from a downtown, urban hotel. The King George is kept very clean, both in the rooms and common areas. The bathrooms (in the rooms) are a bit small, and the tile work and design show their age, but they are well maintained and are kept clean. The shower water temprature fluctuates while in use but was never uncomfortable. The lighting in the vanity area of the bathroom is a bit dim, with yellow shades. The king size bed was very comfortable and felt very new. The King George boasts an afternoon tea which you must attend at least once. Happy hour daily in their lounge (never busy). The Hotel is located next door to a 24 hour bistro which serves exellent bistro fare with good prices. The Hotel staff is very helpful and happy to do so. When asked where to eat lunch prior to checking in, we were given three excellent choices, including the Cheesecake Factory on the top floor of Macy's (1 block away). The Bell desk checked our bags for the time prior to check-in, about 2 hours and again on our day of departure after check-out for 8 hours, without hesitation. If you are planning to eat Italian, go to Franchino's. It is a small Mom and Pop place that serves the BEST pasta that I have ever had, this includes Babbo in NYC.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Michigan","reviewSubmissionTime":"2006-08-28T14:53:42Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"14451","reviewId":"18631785","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":2,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Glenn","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Not very impressed","reviewText":"The King George was ok but nothing special.

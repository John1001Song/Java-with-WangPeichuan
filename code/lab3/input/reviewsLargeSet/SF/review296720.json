Also, if you are sensitive to noise, ask for a room that is NOT a room with an adjoining door to the next room.  We could hear his phone conversations, his choice of tv viewing, and some dubious body noises.\r\n\r\nThe food at the hotel restaurant was very good.

I researched several hotels for price, location, amenities, and other travelers opinions, and the Hilton Garden Inn seemed like the best choice for the price. It offered free WiFi, a breakfast buffet (got the breakfast package), an indoor heated pool, and free parking. Our overall experience at the hotel was great. The staff was very nice and helpful, especially the morning staff in the dining area. The evening staff in the dining area was less friendly, but we only ate there one evening, so it didn't bother us much. The breakfast buffet was a typical American breakfast, but was good and included made to order omlettes. We made good use of the free internet to help us plan our daily activities. The indoor pool was not very big, but my children enjoyed it and there were few people using it when we were there. For those driving to S.F., having free parking was a big plus. Some nearby hotels were charging $15 a night, while downtown hotels were charging $25-$45 a night. As for location, it was freeway close and only about a 10 min drive to downtown S.F. The hotel and room was clean and comfortable, with the only complaint being that they have double beds instead of queen beds. This makes it a little tight when sleeping two to a bed.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Upland, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-01-25T21:30:28Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Families","categoryLabel":"Families"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"296720","reviewId":"17959313","photos":[],"itinId":"351376273","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Debbi","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Helpful & Friendly Staff","reviewText":"Hotel was perfect for early morning international flight the next day (I live in the Bay Area).

Also, I was there on New Year's Eve and worried about guest noise - didn't hear a thing. Morning shuttle was also on time (5 a.m.!).

We settled and got ready feeling fresh and clean. We took the bart to the game and it was an amazing day. The people at the front desk whether it be morning or night gave both my husband & I a 5 star service. We really felt so comfortable and safe at the hotel. The morning staff who worked everyday during our stay at the restaurant was always courteous and professional. We felt like we were at home. Being that we are from Hawaii and were spending our 18th anniversary there it was like being at home. The \"Aloha Spirit\" was throughout the hotel. I definitely recommend this hotel and will stay there again when visiting San Francisco. Thank you to all the staff at the Hilton Garden Inn San Francisco Airport North.

If you are visiting the bay area and need to reach outer areas like Muir Woods or Monterey, this is a good, central region to stay (just north of the airport.) Positives: comfortable beds, quiet room, easy to find location Negatives: bathrooms need upgrading, as shower head was nearly broken and the toilet showed its age; located in biotech industrial area; my daughter said the small pool had a grimy bottom. Overall, good if you just want a peaceful night; go elsewhere if you're looking for four star or higher quality","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Cameron Park, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-08-08T15:04:16Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"296720","reviewId":"17959278","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Paulette","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Hotel is Fine..Room 213 not Best","reviewText":"the hotel was fine, staff friendly...but room 213 was noisy and the shower smelled mildewy.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Los Angeles,California","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-08-02T05:39:05Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"296720","reviewId":"17959282","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"david","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Geat place","reviewText":"We stayed here for 4 nights and I have to say the service was top notch. room service was fast, free compurer use,frig, microwave in rooms were a big help. they even have wash& dryer to use for free. 10 min away from sf downtown.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"blythe,ca","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-07-25T15:57:50Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"296720","reviewId":"17959281","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"joe","brandType":"Expedia","title":"would go back any time","reviewText":"please check the ease of local transportation from your hotel to the places you want to see or things you what to see.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"palm harbor fl.","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-07-20T14:37:52Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"296720","reviewId":"17959283","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":1,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Angela","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Not impressed","reviewText":"I was certain that this would be a place filled with comfortable ammenities.

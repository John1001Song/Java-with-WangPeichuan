Comfy bed, Spacious Room","reviewText":"The time we went to San Fran all the hotels were almost sold out since there was a convention so this was our last option. It was definitely overpriced about 2 times what it normally is. However, the staff was super accommodating since we arrived about 5am and couldn't check in till around 3p, they let us store our bags so we could go out and explore the city. It was really convenient that the hotel included a breakfast buffet since there are no other restaurants around. I thought the buffet had a lot of variety. As for the hotel room it was spacious with two king beds and the beds were really comfy. The air con though was a bit confusing to use since it tends to go to heater when you put it to 70 degrees and has to be 69 or less to be cold. I did like this hotel but I wouldn't choose it again since it isn't close to the city and there isn't much around the area for food options.

My room faced outward, but other than some train whistles and RR crossing bells in the evening and morning was pretty quiet. If quiet means a lot to you, I'd suggest asking for a room facing one of the two courtyards. The room was spacious (king-size bed, full-size couch, desk, dresser, etc.) and so was the bathroom. The furnishings in the bedroom were older, but the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom fixtures looked new. All was clean, with no smell. The individual heating/AC system worked fine, as did the TV. The lighting in the bedroom was not great (not very bright, lamps elderly), but that in the bathroom was fine.\r\n\r\nThe shuttle service was excellent; check-in was fine, although a couple ahead of me seemed to be having some difficulties. The desk staff were efficient (for me) but not especially welcoming. The breakfast area next to the lobby was quite large and very clean, and the free continental breakfast actually included eggs and sausage as well as toast, waffles, cereal, fruit, yogurt, juice, and decent coffee.\r\n\r\nI think this was a good basic airport hotel, and was good value--especially in pricy San Francisco.\r\n\r\nThe hotel provides a map of the property so you can find your room easily.

Rooms large and comfy (we got the king suite with sitting area), has small fridge and micro. Bath clean and large. Two of us stayed 6 days and did not feel cramped. Rates are very cheap compared to downtown SF and you can be in the city very quickly. Bed was comfy and many pillows of different types makes picking a good one easy.

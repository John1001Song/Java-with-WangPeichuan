The so-called breakfast was the most basic of prepackaged bread, and coffee, however we were not able to even partake of this as the office did not open until 8am (despite staff members being present), and we were told to go away and come back later, which was not possible as we had excursions arranged.

We wanted a location that was close to the Wharf and some of the other attractions and have stayed at other Days Inns in the past because they are a decent, inexpensive motel, with a good free breakfast.  I think this may have been the tiniest motel room we have ever stayed in, which was somewhat understandable because we were right in the middle of the city.  Overall, it was okay, but we wouldn't stay again.  The location is great.  Walking distant to many restaurants, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the Wharf.  The rooms were super tiny though, the bed a bit hard, and the Free breakfast consisted of coffee, juice, and packaged pastries.  Every other Days Inn has bagels, toast, cereal, and WAFFLES (which s what I was looking forward to).  Also, when we stopped for our free breakfast on Sunday before we checked out, the reception area where the breakfast was located, was locked!  So, we walked down the street and had breakfast.  Also, on their website they state they they have a shuttle to the airport.  Somewhere I saw that it was $15 one way, which is a great deal!  We were charged $20 per person, which isn't horrible, but wasn't expected.  It took 3 attempts for us just to book the shuttle, so were glad to just get it booked.  Overall, an okay stay, but not up to par with other Days Inn motels.

As long as you only need the room and not many amenities or perks and services, it's perfectly fine. I was within easy walking distance of more amazing food than you can imagine. The \"continental breakfast\" was a joke- a coffee urn and packaged honey buns, but who cares when the *best coffee in San Francisco* is 4 doors down? Easy bus access to the Presidio, Golden Gate Bridge, and Golden Gate Park, within walking distance of the trendy Union Street shopping district. I also found Japantown, the Embarcadero and the Exploratorium, and more accessible by a reasonable bus ride. Since I was busy all the time, I wasn't spending a ton of time there anyway, so I was quite satisfied with the price for what I got. I had some noisy neighbors the second night, but the hotel management did come and talk to them. \r\nFor folks on a budget, this meets a lot of needs.

First off, the Manager was very pleasant and kind. The details in the room I was impressed with was the flat screen tv, the new digital heater/air conditioner. The crown molding in the room and new bathroom sink and skylight in the bathroom. It was obvious that the owners take very good care of this hotel. The only short coming, is as with most hotels in San Francisco, is the narrow and tight parking. But there's nothing the hotel can do about that. I would definately stay there again next year when it's time to bring my daughter home from college. The location is terrific! The Marina district offers lots of good places to eat, get coffee, even drug stores within walking distance.

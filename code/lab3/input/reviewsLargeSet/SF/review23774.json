Hotel is across the street from the Ferry building and has easy access to multiple forms of transportation.  The hotel staff were all pleasant and tried to be accommodating.\r\nOn the other hand the room was very small and lacking a dresser or any type of drawers at all.  We were staying 5 nights and there was absolutely no where to unpack.  My complaint to the front desk yielded 2 small baskets and extra hangers.  Not a comfortable way to settle in.\r\nWe chose to upgrade our room to a balcony with a view of the bay and although the balcony was nice the view from the room mostly consisted of the office building next door.  \r\nAfter calling before the trip and asking at the front desk at check in if the room fridge had a freezer and being assured it did...it did not.  We travel with medical supplies that require a freezer.  They did accommodate us but it required parking a dormitory style fridge in the corner of the tiny room.\r\nLastly I happened to check my credit card status on line toward the end of the stay to find Hyatt had charged $550 to my card.  I was angry to learn they neglected to tell us they charge $75.00 per day \"in case\" you charge incidentals to the room.

They ended up sending us a $75 gift card from the front desk staff and a $50 gift card from the hotel manager, both for the little cafe on the lobby, which was really appreciated. The location was amazing. Not incredibly touristy like Fisherman's Wharf, which was really nice. There were tons of great restaurants and shops in both the Embarcadero center, which is right next to the hotel, and the Ferry building across the street. It's also in a great location if you're up for some walking. Union Square, Fisherman's Wharf, Chinatown, and North Beach are all 20-35 minute walks away, which is great! We also happened to be staying there during the 4th of July, and even though the area near the hotel is safe, things throughout the city became extremely rowdy, especially after the fireworks. The hotel was completely prepared for this. Hotel staff were at the main entrance (all other entrances were locked) only letting people in who had room cards. The elevators were also locked out for the night so they could not be used at all without swiping a room card. The next morning things had quieted down and the area was back to normal, but it was really comforting that night to know that the hotel was prepared for the holiday. Overall, I'd highly recommend this hotel!

This hotel had a great location in terms of access to public transportation. You are only steps from BART, MUNI bus, MUNI subway, free Presidio shuttles and ferries. The hotel has a lot of wasted space and opportunities. For starters there are great places with great views of the bay - everyone of the 14 \"regular\" floors has a large open space with floor to ceiling windows facing the bay - however without chairs or sofas they are not much good for anything but the occasional gaze. The walkways leading to the rooms are single file as the oddly angled rooms jut out ever 20 feet or so.  Inside our king room there is a large (rather useless) entryway with a table which results in a claustrophobic shower & toilet area. The room has a single sitting chair and a desk chair, so plan to watch TV from the Bed if there are more then one of you. Even as a single person you will be moving furniture around to get a view of the TV. While our \"Bay view\" room had a partial view of the bay, there is again no way to enjoy it while sitting down as unnecessary store architectural accents on the outside of the floor to ceiling windows blocks your view. All of these leading to the idea that this is intended for a single person on a business trip, not a vacation. Finally, I would suggest skipping the limited, overpriced hotel food in lieu of better, cheaper local  restaurants. Just be careful to check their hours as on weekends some places are closed.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"Location","negativeRemarks":"Make use of the large empty areas with great views - add couches and chairs so people can sit and enjoy the views.

Decided to take the coast back home and stop in San Francisco for the first time.  The Hyatt was the first hotel that popped up with two double beds as we are a family of 4. First, the entrance was very confusing to find the front desk.  Second, the parking was not convenient.  Pretty far away to grab something forgotten in the car. Just not possible.  Third, the staff was not friendly.  Could not give a smile and did not tell us about the hotel in any way.  Just handed us the room cards and it was up to us to find it.  Forth, after settled in, we went to the lounge to relax and grab a drink.  All the tables were dirty and the server came over to let us know the kitchen was closed but we could still order a drink.

When we checked in the room (with one king size bed) and request the beds for kids, I was told I have to pay $25 for the bed. The operator told me I have to contact expedia.com for the charge.\r\n2. Before I checked in, I called hotel and asked the parking place at Embarcadero parking lot 3 or 4 next to the  hotel, I was told the parking there was not overnight. The operator told me the hotel has the overnight valet parking. In reality, parking at Embarcadero parking lot 3 or 4 is overnight for $34. The hotel valet parking costs twice high.\r\n3. Hotel room AC unit does not have enough power. I asked the hotel engineer to come and check and he said it worked fine. So I have to request an additional mobile heater in the room.\r\n4. At around 8am, the cleaning person knocked on the door for cleaning the room before I got up. My wife answer the door and told her we are not ready. My wife asked her what is the check out time, she answered 11am. The fact is that the check out time is at noon.\r\n5. As soon as we checked out and lock the door at around 10:30am, my kid found she left her hat in the room. So I asked the cleaning lady to call the hotel security to open the room for us.

Getting around the city was simple as well. Muni bus lines and even cable cars were available right outside the front door, and we were within easy walking distance to several restaurants and the Ferry Building. Longer walks led us to the Exploratorium, Fisherman's Wharf and Market Street. \r\n\r\nSome downtown hotels can be seedy, but not the Hyatt. The huge atrium had recently been renovated, and the rooms were modern and clean as well. The staff was very friendly and accommodating.\r\n\r\nOur only complaints:\r\n\r\n- The bathroom is very small. Our family of three found ourselves tripping over each other. Not much the Hyatt can do about that, but the huge Atrium felt like wasted space, given how tight our bathroom facilities were.\r\n\r\n- The breakfast buffet was delicious but overpriced. For three of us, the bill came to $100, including tip.

First time I've ever used them, and they helped us with getting around San Francisco.  We used public transportation ($2.25 per person), which this hotel is situated perfectly.  We did not try the cable cars, but the stop was right outside the valet door.  We were able to go the Beach (though a long ride), to Haight & Ashbury, Pier 39 and AT&T Park.  We went on a wine tour, which met across the road at the Ferry Building.  The return trip ended at the Ferry building using a ferry transfer across the bay.  We never had to walk more than 300 yards out of the hotel to get to some sort of transportation.    \r\n\r\nMy only complaint was aside from the breakfast offered at the hotel, there were not many morning restaurants to choose from except all of the coffee shops that offered pastries and bagels.\r\n\r\nI thought maybe for the price of the room per night they might offer a van transfer to or from the SFO (airport), but sadly they do not.

The only dining option is an open cafeteria style hall at the bottom of the hotel that is exceedingly noisy and which plays auto-pop (machine 'music') with the same verse over-and-over again for 8-12 minutes at a time (torture). You will get a better dining experience at McDonalds. The rooms are small, the furniture was probably installed 20-30 years ago and looks like what we had in our house in the 1980s. If you give up and try buying your own snack in the gift store you are in for a 'treat'. You cannot charge anything to your room from the gift store unless you show ID, room key and sign 3 (!) different receipts. The process takes 10  minutes. Once in the room, the bed is comfortable, but you will be charged $9.95 to use the internet, and there is no mini-bar in your room. There is also no coffee maker in the room (like Marriott and Hilton). So what you get is a run-down hotel that has seen better days and a service level and dining experience that is below any standard. All of this for the 'pleasure' of paying over $350 per night. The only good experience is the Consierge desk which is staffed by friendly and very helpful people. Stay away and pick any other 4-star hotel in SF, where you will most likely have a much better experience.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":1,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"Consigere desk","negativeRemarks":"Demolish and build a new hotel (or do major renovation).

The rooms are well equipped, a bit dark but very spacious in comparison to other hotels I have previously stayed at in San Francisco. They have very comfortable beds and it is relatively quiet, despite thinnish walls and there being sewage pipe renovation just outside the main lobby entrance, below from our rooms.The only complaints I have would be the showers, very old fashioned and not very efficient, in fact the one on the 12th floor had to be replaced as it was faulty and no free Wi-Fi.\n\nOverall though I would recommend this hotel for its location, close to the Wharf area, Union Square, the California cable car, Bart and Muni transport etc. We personally did not have breakfast there as it seemed overpriced, but if you wander locally there are various places to eat; we used 'Breaking Bread' in 4 Embarcadero regularly.

I still held off, as I didn't want to pay more since the room was paid for. So then he offered to upgrade us for $30 total for 2 nights. Still, I held off. Finally, he told us he'd just kick someone else out of a king room for us and give us the room I'd paid for. Was that so hard??? How can they possibly not have a room which is prepaid.

I prefer a smaller feeling in a hotel... but you cannot beat the location.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2012-11-08T19:51:44Z","roomTypeId":200181839,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"23774","reviewId":"40022377","photos":[],"itinId":"151148811438","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"DK","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great location","reviewText":"The hotel is in the Financial District, so while it is a very clean/safe area with all transportation within the block, most street-side restaurants and coffee shops closed for the entire weekend.\n\nThe hotel is geared for the business person, so the hotel staff was attentive and quick...also very pleasant.\n\nExcept for a shortage of hot water in the shower, our stay was perfect.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"The staff and easy transportation","negativeRemarks":"Cafes were closed for the weekend","locationRemarks":"Close to Ferry Building and Embarcadero.","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Orange Country, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2012-11-06T19:07:51Z","roomTypeId":200162382,"userDisplayName":"DK","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"BusinessTravelers","categoryLabel":"BusinessTravelers"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"23774","reviewId":"39996424","photos":[],"itinId":"150461997840","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"JWG","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Still Our Favorite SanFrancisco Hotel","reviewText":"When we checked in we opted for a bay view room for a $30 premium.

The bar in the lobby is good but we wanted to go to the Regency Club on the rooftop. However, we arrived too late. They informed us that it closes at 9:00pm and also you need to make reservations. This is not a budget hotel at all but if you want to stay in a good hotel in SF there are no cheap options.

The hotel lobby is spectacular, has to be seen to be believed. Many eateries within a couple of blocks and a 24-hour store right across the street. The rooms were well appointed, scrupulously clean and very comfortable. Loved the floor to ceiling windows too! The exercise room was great but really missed a pool or spa to rest my aching feet from all the walking we did! Seriously, the only poor experience was with the concierge who were absolutely terrible, all of them. I dealt with at least four different ones and they were equally indifferent, one had terrible body odor and none seemed bothered to do their job. A real contrast to the front desk agents who couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating. We asked for an early check-in and a late check-out, we got it. I asked them for help with things I would normally ask a concierge and they were terrific! Has drinks in the lobby bar and the staff there were great too.

The location was perfect for us - it was a mile walk to AT & T park and a mile in the other direction to Fisherman's Wharf (although there are buses and trolleys so you certainly don't have to walk). Also, the end of one of the cable car lines is steps from the lobby door, which made riding the cable cars tremendously easy, which we did for both fun and as an actual means of getting somewhere. Further, there was a BART/Muni station right next to the hotel, which made using public transportation very convenient.\nThe room was more than adequate and the staff was nothing but helpful, including moving us to a different room on night two so that we had a view of the bay and the Bay Bridge, which was stunning.\nOne drawback is that you are in the financial district, so there are not a lot of restaurant choices, but its adequate, especially if dining isn't a top priority.\nI had considered staying in the Fisherman's Wharf area, but I am very glad I didn't. A couple of visits there were great, but the more quiet area near the Hyatt, along with the great location, made it a perfect spot for what was a truly unforgettable trip to a most unique, beautiful and just plain awesome city.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Londonderry, Nh","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-09-10T17:39:33Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Families","categoryLabel":"Families"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"23774","reviewId":"18526259","photos":[],"itinId":"326048543","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":2,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Kristy","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Beautiful, but Nickel and Dimed..and not Helpful.","reviewText":"A beautiful building, though bathrooms a bit outdated.

It turns out that the mini-bar has a sensor that every time you pick up any item inside the mini-bar it will automatically be added to your credit card. It just seemes to us that the hotel is just trying and hoping that you dont pay attention so they can make more money. My wife and I, just find it hard to believe that a hotel of this high caliber can't or just wont give a little back to their customer's. Maybe they will one day realize that if you give someone a glass of water(bottled), they will return and probably will recommend other people.

Since this was the City afterall, we figured there would be differences. Parking in Monterey was easy and free. Not so here--parking can be expensive but we found a reasonably priced parking garage a couple of blocks away and hoofed it with our luggage. The Hyatt's location was perfect--it was across the street from the Ferry Building, close to restaurants, shopping and the shuttle to Pier 39 was right in front of the Ferry Building. You won't need your car! The Cable Car to Chinatown is within walking distance of the Hyatt so you can fit lunch or dinner in Chinatown into your itinerary very easily. The same Cable car can bring you to the famed Fairmont and Mark Hopkins hotels.\n\nOur room was beautifully done, very high end. We enjoyed drinks at the bar located just off the lobby.

But not providing free internet service in this day and age is totally unacceptable. In my opinion the per day charge for internet service is like a slap in the face to people who need to carry on their lives while they're away from home. Couldn't they just include this as part of the regular provided services and it wouldn't change anyone's bill by more than a dollar or two or should I be thinking of this in the same way as the breakfast?

Amazing location. I loved staying on the Embarcadero & got myself from SFO almost to front entrance of the hotel by public transit, BART. The staff was courteous on the whole - a few especially memorable. (I find being nice to folks, remembering how hard it is dealing with demanding customers all day, usually gets this result.)THE MINUSES: I could hear the guy next door snoring & on the phone. Admittedly he was loud, but walls are thinner than I'd like. There are also 8am wake-up bells from Ferry Building (not the worst alarm clock). And if you're lucky enough to have a terrace (w/gorgeous bay view) & folks party 2:30am on terrace above, just know you can hear it. I'm extra-sensitive to noise, but found ear plugs worked nicely (ask at desk or go across street to Walgreen's). Otherwise, the room was quiet & I was able to enjoy my time while in the room. EXTRA MINUS: An East Coast snow storm canceled my flight(s). I called on room phone for help & was told hotel was full so he had to charge me full rate. (Very high for me.) He kept telling me he didn't negotiate, but came back a few times anyway, final offer still high for me not knowing how many days I’d be stuck. I feel hotel could have been more accommodating (and he could have shown more empathy), since I didn't choose to be stuck & hadn't planned to spend that much more!

The attitude was also very snooty when I asked about the vallet parking and bag storage while we shopped upon checking out. Again the front desk clerk was very snooty and pompous when I was genuinely trying to inquire some simple information, as if I should have known what their vallet and storage policies were. The room was great except the tub plug did not work when I tried to take a bath. It leaked water so I had to cut my bath short.

Then on, we really enjoyed our stay at the hotel. We were away from the hotel for a few days to travel to Yosemite and we got the same room upon return which we very much appreciated. The hotel is ideally located - it is not at the downtown union square but near the beautiful Bayfront. This means while almost everything is within walking distance (e.g. union square, fishermans wharf , telegraph hill are all easily approachable by a 15/20 minute-walk), you do not get the noise and crowd of the downtown. Plus the cable car, street car, and subway stops are just around the corner. The hotel also has budget car rental on the premise which was extremely useful - we rented our car from there and it was very easy to return the car and check into at the hotel again - saved us a lot of hassle of having to return the car elsewhere and go to another hotel with luggage. And finally, the stuff was very friendly and accommodating throughout our stay. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay there (except for the first night) and will surely go back there again.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"York, UK","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-09-07T14:47:57Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"23774","reviewId":"18526411","photos":[],"itinId":"289123036","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Evy","brandType":"Expedia","title":"good location","reviewText":"Great location in city center, close to restaurants, shops and aiport access.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Puerto Rico","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-09-07T01:40:42Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"4","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_ca","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"23774","reviewId":"18526448","photos":[],"itinId":"289229568","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"4105","userNickname":"Liane","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Well located","reviewText":"Hotel was located at the right place to get to the Pier and the Market.

Now for the not nice features: this was not an inexpensive room, yet internet access is an additional ten dlls per day; the mini bar has sensors - so if you pick something up to look at it you get charged even if you don't consume it; the hotel is very large, and the elevators give free access to whomever walks in, giving it an unsafe feeling late at night.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Buffalo Grove, IL","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-01-21T09:25:51Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"3","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_gb","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"23774","reviewId":"18526286","photos":[],"itinId":"18828666","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"2057","userNickname":"Troy","brandType":"Expedia","title":"High Anxiety at the Embarcadero Center","reviewText":"There's no mistaking that this Hyatt is an architectural masterpiece. The lobby was used as the location for ascene in 'Towering Inferno' and Mel Brooks used the place for shooting much of 'High Anxiety'. But what a shame that the room interiors are so shabby and neglected. The pace has more of the ambience of a 1970s motel than the international hotel it's meant to be. Coincidentally, I was also informed by at least two members of (very helpful and charming) staff that it's the second most popular place to commit suicide in San Francisco (after the Golden Gate Bridge). The downtown location is hard to beat and a big plus is that most of the rooms open out on to private terraces: many with views towards the Bay. For the price, I could think of many better places to stay in the city. For architectural kitsch factor, you may be better off visiting the place rather than staying at it.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"London","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-01-17T10:47:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"23774","reviewId":"18526371","photos":[],"itinId":"257075182","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Michelle","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Love this hotel!!","reviewText":"This is our second time stayed in this hotel within a year.

The Hotel is in the Embarcadero Centre that has several shops/restaraunts. The shops typically close at 7pm which was a bit of a downer. The Hotel restaraunt was very expensive, but right out side is a great bagel type place called Noahs good food, fair price. Hotel staff friendly and knowledgeable.

Right around the corner many more local places to eat. On the bay side, about a 3 minute walk, many more shops and local restaurants right by the water. The start of one of the cable lines is right outside of the hotel. Also, a subway stop right outside. It is a 10 to 15 minute walk to Union Square. 15 to 20 minute walk to North Beach. However both walks are enjoyable and not hard. Lots of people around at night. We felt safe. Even when the hotel was almost full, we never felt crowded. Our only small complaints were that the lobby was under construction and it wasn't mentioned to us beforehand. Although, I must say it did not interfere with anything and we did not hear any noises from it. The position of the TV in our room was a bit odd. The carpet in the room seems a bit old, but it was clean.

The hotel door, at the reception was always open, therefore, if you are having bkf, it was always cold and unpleasant. All breakfast cutlery and plates/cups were made of plastic. The orange juice tasted like water, although it was supposed to be from \"Minute Maid\", 100% juice, but tasted nothing like water. The apple juice was also very bad.

When I got to the hotel, the receptionist said it was 12pm. Normally I wouldn't care but we had been driving for almost 7 hours and I wanted a pace to lay down! The man was refusing to let us have a room early at first, but eventually gave in. Other than that incident, the only thing id have to complain about is the fact that the room service people insisted on coming\nin every morning, even when I left the \"do not disturb\" sign up. The room was clean, all the employees were very nice. Good times.\nAlso, the bus stop was a block away that took us right into the Chinatown area.

The \"shuttle-service\" means that you have to call the hotel and have them give you a special number for a taxi company that will then pick you up. In my case, it took them about an hour to do so and I had to call them three times before the driver finally showed up at the right spot. Note that there is also another Ramada Limited in SF that offers a regular shuttle-service from the airport. This apearently leads to a lot of confusion. My room smelled somewhat funky, the toilet was running and when I picked up the hotel guide, it was soaked in some kind of fluid (I hope it was just water...). The friendliness of the staff was highly variable: While one guy was very nice and super-helpful, the other guy was simply rude and appeared to be annoyed by my presence. He also left the counter for about 20 min. one morning and there is no bell or call button on the desk... The breakfast is very basic but okay. Since the breakfast room is way too small, most guests end up eating in their rooms. The hotel is also far away from the typical SF attractions (Golden Gate Bridge, Fisherman's dwarf). In sum; If you're only staying for a single night and want to be close to the airport, then this hotel might be acceptable for you.

It was pretty good. It was a pretty clean room too, except the bath area still had some fell off hair from a person who stayed there prior. That was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed. It is a place close to airport, and about 10 miles from the downtown SF. The price is okay. Not really cheap, neither expensive.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Redding, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2006-12-07T02:19:38Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":2,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":2,"hotelId":"790530","reviewId":"19975420","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":1,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Marie","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Never again","reviewText":"The room that was given, the heater did not work.

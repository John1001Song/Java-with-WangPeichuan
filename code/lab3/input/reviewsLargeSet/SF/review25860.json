Not great if you are a light sleeper. We were on the 9th floor so at least street noise wasn't an issue and the road didn't seem too busy anyway so even lower down I think it would be quiet on that front. Fire exits (first thing I always check) were good. The hotel offers complimentary wine some afternoons in the reception which is a nice touch. However the live music was totally wrong for the occasion - a weirdly dressed, middle aged man in punky vest top Etc with futuristic sunglasses on an electric keyboard blaring his rock compositions jarred hugely with the rather genteel crowd trying to enjoy a relaxed drink and a natter. Everyone looked bemused and I felt rather sorry for the man who would be considered perfectly talented in another setting but here everyone was just gawping at him because he looked so bizarrely out of place. Whoever books the hotel's live music should know their clientele and the tone of the hotel better. Maybe they book this guy so no-one stays for a 2nd glass of wine!!!

Part of the problem was not knowing the city that well and just picking a cheaper hotel near my destination. Understand that San Francisco is noisy in most places, has terrible parking in general, and can be dark and unsafe in a lot of neighborhoods. However, this hotel was particularly noisy because of very thin walls and poorly sealed doors. The pipes in the walls were very noisy and the heater in the room would make odd bubbly noises all night. There was no mini-fridge in the room but a very spacious closet. The hotel room was very basic. It was not a place that you wanted to spend much time. The hotel elevators were quite old as well and with 9 floors and luggage they were essential.

Our room had a giant walk-in closet. We were able to put all our luggages in there. Took out clutter from the rest of the room. There was also a safe in the closest. The hotel room had no AC which is fine because we stayed mid October and again reminds me of Europe. It had big windows that opened all the way and a ceiling fan which kept the room nice and crisp. The room had a nice view of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nFriday night the lobby had the fireplace lit. From 530-6pm the hotel was serving free wine to guests.

The hotel is in one of the rare buildings to have fared well in the 1989 earthquake due to its ancient but well designed anti-seismic basement steel structure, says the hotel brochure. Tis an old building. The room was comfortable with cable TV and HBO. Free wifi had limited bandwidth, which was enough for email and downloading must of my work files (no videos). (You can get higher bandwidth if you pay.) Very clean bed linen and bathroom. One inconvenience was the central heating. The radiator had some sort of air valve to let the air out and therefore improve the heating efficiency of circulating water (especially on the top floor, where I was). It obviously worked very well (that thing got nicely hot!) but the valve made a pressure cooker sound of varying volume and in the middle of the night that was not welcome. Typically one purges the water circuit from time to time to remedy this so I don't know what the deal was here. I saw an electric radiator in the hallway of my floor one morning so I might assume my room wasn't the only one with a heating glitch. In San Francisco, even in February, it's not much of an issue, though. I just heated the room during the day and turned the thing off at night.

Open the ironing board and use it for personal items. Being an old hotel, the rooms and bathrooms are not huge, but they are kept neat and in great repair. We were so busy sightseeing, that more floor space wouldn't have added any value. The bed was comfortable and the TV had good reception. We couldn't have asked for more!

This is a quirky hotel which will not be to all tastes or meet all guests' demands (no bar, no room service, for example), but it's full of character. The daily free wine reception, held in the elegant lobby from 5.30 to 6.00, sets the tone, encouraging guests to mix and chat, to the accompaniment of ace receptionist Theo's inimitable keyboard stylings. The in-house restaurant serves a reasonable (if quite pricy) breakfast, but there is a host of alternatives in the surrounding streets, particularly Polk Street with its vast range of cuisines. Great location means that downtown, Chinatown, the waterfront, anywhere you would want to be, in fact, are accessible within 20-30 minutes' brisk walking or by means of a short cab - or cablecar - ride. I'd strongly recommend the pedestrian option - there is so much to see that can only fully be appreciated on foot. Bit hilly, though, which doesn't bother me, but may not be for everyone.\nDownsides - the rooms seem to lack any soundproofing, and being woken up at 4 am by the sounds of a seemingly endless and very noisy trash collection wasn't great, nor was the unignorable sound of the the - er - enthusiastically occupied couple in the room above. However - on balance a memorable stay at a hotel with warm, genuine staff and a great atmosphere.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"St Neots, United Kingdom","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-02-28T19:38:03Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Other","categoryLabel":""}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"25860","reviewId":"18317378","photos":[],"itinId":"357981417","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":2,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Richard","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Rundown and smelly","reviewText":"This hotel is much too close to the rough parts of the tenderloin.

I guarantee you that this is not a dangerous location. It may be on the outskirts of a rougher section of town, but this part of the street is fine.

I was asked to call another time because the front desk was so busy they couldn't take the other guest's name. When I called again the next day, I was transferred to an answering machine but apparently it did work since the name was on the reservation by the time we arrived. Check in was fine, attentive front desk, no complaints. Secondly, we needed a cab so we called the concierge and got our call transferred to another guest's room which had us all confused with whom we were talking to. And the worst comes next... I got back to the hotel in the afternoon and the room had been cleaned however, the bathroom was exactly the way it was when we left. I again called the front desk and they said the maid was hungry and forgot to come back to finish the room. Since we were leaving in ten minutes, we asked them to send the maid then but she got there right away and I had to tell her to come back later. So apparently communication is a bit hard at this hotel, they seem to not listen to what you say. Those were my biggest problems, but overall the hotel was clean, ok for the price, room was a little small and the shower could be a little hotter, specially early in the morning.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Los Angeles, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-11-08T04:59:40Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"3","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_gb","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"25860","reviewId":"18317316","photos":[],"itinId":"23020518","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"2057","userNickname":"Gail","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Nice Hotel","reviewText":"The hotel was really nice.

This place is very nice, and it was exactely what others have said about it. Here are some important hightlights: The staff was VERY helpful and pleasant. The comedy show by the guys at the front desk was great. There is a daily wine reception every night from 5:30 pm to 6:00pm. Parking is VALET only and is $30.00 per day. It's a short walk to Hyde Street, where you can catch the cable car. Taxi's are everywhere and easy to hail. The rooms are nicely sized (for two) and are equipped with flat screen tvs. The only down fall to the hotel was the siren noise at night. There is fire station located close by and the Fire Trucks run regulary at night responding to calls. A good idea to bring ear plugs if you can sleep with them. The hotel was very charming and quaint. Easy to get to from the 101 freeway and just a short drive to the Golden Gate Bridge. A good place to stay since it's Centrally located. I travel alot for my job and normally stay at the larger chain hotels throughout the country.

But this wasn't a problem for us.\n\nAlso -- kudos to the Carlton Hotel for putting shampoo, conditioner, and body wash dispensers in the shower as well as recycling bins in the room.\n\nThe only downside of the room was the noise level: we could hear people in the room next to ours very clearly... and no doubt they heard us.

The atmosphere is very relaxing and quiet, even though we were there on Pride Weekend, which means lots of people. The one thing that I wished I had known about ahead of time is about the parking. It costs $30 a day to have the hotel valet park your car and you can have access to it any time you want. (And this is a very comparable rate to many other places that we saw) However, I heard them telling someone else that if you want them to store your car and you don't need to use it while you are in SF it is only $20 a day. With plenty of public transportation around and the pain in the butt it is to find parking in the city I wish I had taken advantage of this option.

In addition, the walls themselves are ultra-thin. If you have neighbors, you WILL hear EVERYTHING! The first night, I only slept for 2.5 hours. We asked the front desk what we could do, and the best option they had for us was to switch rooms, and I appreciated very much that they kept guests out of our neighboring rooms for the rest of our stay. We were given earplugs after requesting them, so that did help a bit, but I cam back from a four night stay utterly exhausted. In addition to all of the noise, none of the rooms have actual curtains or drapes-- just horizontal blinds. I am used to sleeping in the dark, so it was very problematic for me to have all of the city lights just shining right in. The staff gave us blankets to hang over the windows, so that did help some, but we did not feel pampered in any way, that's for sure! Some of the beds were comfortable, but my companion got a lousy bed that was very bowed in the middle and woke up with shoulder and neck issues.\n\nTo reiterate, the staff there is very kind and do their best, but the hotel itself is lousy and all of the smiles in the world cannot change that.

The staff the best. They put our friend close in #610 and us in #608. None of us found the walls paper thin. The view wasn't great but we didn't care. You could hear the doors in the hallways and water running but nothing unordinary. We could hear sirens sometimes from a nearby fire station and hospital but it wasn't bad. I sleep with earplugs anyways. The room is a good size with a desk and big closet with safe, iron and ironing board. The bed was sooo comfortable! rooms clean and the perfect temperature. Nice Moroccan, modern decor, a coffee maker in room with complimentary coffee, teabags would be nice. It's a green hotel so you can have laundry done or not, just let the cleaning staff know. They also have recycling bins which is great.There are 2 computers in the Lobby, you get 20 minutes free per day on your Visa. The free wine tasting in the evenings from 5:30 to 6:00pm is awesome and it's very popular!! We thought the location was great, lots of buses go nearby and not too far from Market St. and Union square. Good shops and restaurant nearby. I know there are some rough spots in the Tenderloin, we had no problems. The SAHA Restaurant is fabulous and we were not disappointed. The food was amazing! and they had Vegan options. a reasonable amount and price for the fantasic flavor sensations there.So I would just say \"stay here\" next time you are in San Francisco it's a FABULOUS Hotel!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Vancouver, B.C.

They are very friendly, funny and helpful. They went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. However, I wasn't 100% impressed with the condition of our room. Although the decor is nice it is an older building and our room (King size bed) felt a little cramped. The bed didn't actually feel as big as the king sized bed we have at home. The rooms don't have any air conditioning (not a problem since we were there at end of October and didn't require air conditioning.) The bathroom was cramped. It appeared as though the bathroom had been given a \"facelift\" ie new tile surround around the tub but the job didn't appear to be professional. Our room had a big walk-in closet (where the safe was housed) good for dressing but it had a motion activated light which was a bit of a nuissance because if you were standing in the closet getting dressed/ready the light would go out and you had to stand in front of the light and swing your arms to get the light back on. Also no electrical outlet in this room - sort of an inconvenience because if you wanted to iron your clothes (ironing board & iron stored in the closet) you had to take the iron into the already cramped room.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Miramichi, NB, Canada","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-11-12T03:11:51Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"25860","reviewId":"18317101","photos":[],"itinId":"285212266","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Amanda","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Nice hotel, but...","reviewText":"Very nice hotel for the money, but a little too close to the not-so-nice part of town.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-11-11T19:01:03Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"25860","reviewId":"18317448","photos":[],"itinId":"297889250","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Cristina","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Confortable and warm Hotel","reviewText":"We visited San Francisco the last two weeks, it was the first time in San Francisco and whe did'nt know the city.

Also, the hotel is on a major bus route, it seems, because in the morning, you are constantly woken up to the sounds of air brakes and what sounded like garbage trucks going down the alley - there is little to no sound-proofing from the outside, yet when in the halls, it is eerily silent.

Pros: excellent customer service at the desk-willing to help you with any question you might have, comfortable beds, bathrooms with a luxurious feel, availability of basic toiletries (shower has 3 dispensers for shampoo, conditioner and soap-no more tiny bottles), nice-sized rooms, and a fabulous location--3 major bus lines run practically near the hotel, getting you most anywhere you would want to go; It's location is great, walking distant for many sights. Have I mentioned the customer service? Every time we left or came back, we were personally greeted, asking us how we were finding the town and if they could help. Our maid even left us a Happy 4th of July note one day. Additionally, the decor has this Asian eclectic Zen feel, making it so inviting, warm, and friendly, like a friend's home. It was such a welcoming place at the end of a long sight-seeing day. Things to be aware of: --no breakfast served, few restaurant near by (but if you are willing to walk, you will find something, thin walls (you will hear some noise from your neighbors.

The only negative, was that a local hospital is around the block to the hotel, so we could constantly hear sirens from ambulances, but other than that, our stay was great.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Laredo, TX","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-03-21T19:49:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"3","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_gb","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"25860","reviewId":"18317557","photos":[],"itinId":"19197535","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"2057","userNickname":"antony","brandType":"Expedia","title":"i'll probably stay here again","reviewText":"I liked the service and the environment-friendly attitude.

We did not eat there in the evening as the restaurant is closed Sunday and Monday. There is a free wine reception for residents daily. The hotel is situated 5 blocks from Union Square, the main shopping centre, and from the cable car to Fisherman's Wharf. On arrival, the reception staff warned us of the parts of the City to avoid. In all our visits we have never encountered the slightest difficulty. There is a well-stocked supermarket opposite. There is a water dispenser on each floor, although we were assured the tap water was perfectly drinkable. Our room was on the 9th floor and very quiet so far as the Hotel was concerned. However, the San Francisco Fire Department disturbed us with their sirens as we prefer to keep the window open whenever possible. Why so much noise even at three o'clock in the morning!

After we walked through the Carlton doors, we were greeted and let into our very welcoming room. It was very clean, the decor was colorful but not annoying and our bed was extremely welcoming - especially after our morning flight. Throughout our four-night stay at the Carlton, I have many fond memories including free toothpaste and surprisingly fun, nightly wine receptions. We had read a ton of reviews on this place and while there many compliments, there were also some criticisms that I would like to address. The number one negative comment was about the noise and thin walls. Yes, there were sirens occasionally and you could here other people moving about in the hotel, but it was minor. I may get less tolerant as I get older, but it wasn't as bad as I expected based on some reviews. The second criticism has to be about the neighbourhood. Homelessness exists and the sketchy Tenderloin district is within walking distance, but anyone who wanders around aimlessly and passively in a new city maybe shouldn't be travelling by themselves. Not once did we feel uneasy in the area. Another negative comment that I had read a couple of time before our trip was in regards to the Carlton staff being overly polite and borderline-annoying. I may not have developed intimate relationships with the Carlton staff, but I did talk to them enough to see that their concern for our comfort was genuine.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Edmonton, AB","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-11-18T22:45:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"25860","reviewId":"18317180","photos":[],"itinId":"250573193","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Rolf","brandType":"Expedia","title":"A well kept hotel, very conveniently located","reviewText":"We appreciated the very friendly and helpful staff.

They offered great dining suggestions and other tips, and seemed genuinely concerned that I have a great time in SF. A couple drawbacks: Neither of these issues were a problem for me, but you may want to know... 1. The walls in the hotel are very thin. I was lucky to be at the end of the hallway, but I could still hear every door slam on my floor. Door slamming combined with the city noise (and I think I was directly over the restaurant) made for a noisy stay. 2. You cannot control the temperature of your own room.

Found the location ideal for sightseeing on foot. 15 mins from Union Square. Although Fisherman's Wharf 30 - 45mins we didn't find this a problem as we like to explore on foot. Hotel staff very enthusiastic and offered tips on places to visit/eat and bus routes to take to explore further afield. Only made the wine tasting once as were still out sightseeing the other days but a very nice touch. Parking expensive garage next to hotel was $25 per night. Luckily we only had the hire car for the first day having travelled from Yosemite. Only downside was that we had an adjoining door through to the room next door which had quite a gap at the bottom so were kept awake the first night by the chap next door coughing & then a couple of nights later by the new guests coming in at 3am and could hear every detail of their conversation. Used the cushions from the bed to block the gap and muffle the sound.

The only problem is the trouble getting to public transport.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Chicago, IL","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-05-25T05:43:53Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"25860","reviewId":"18317411","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Joel","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Definitely a keeper","reviewText":"This hotel was a great find.

We then proceed to check in which at this time we were greeted by the Front Desk personnel. The person that checked us in was most helpful he provided us maps and even gave us recommendations on restaurants in the area.\n\n The room was very spacious we had a king size bed and the bathroom accommodations were very nice. According to the bell hop Hotel Carlton had just completed a several million dollar renovation which explains the condition of the room. \n\n With all this good there has to be some bad. After reviewing the entire stay the only thing I could find bad was that they provided heat via radiator which was controlled centrally. The main problem with this is if you are a person that tends to get hot very easily which I am, I had no control over the heating. \n\n For the price of the hotel I will stay at Hotel Carlton over and over again.

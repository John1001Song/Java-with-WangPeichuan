I actually had a tape measure with me and I measured them and compared them to standard sizes on at least 10 websites. The management of the hotel said that Marriott had their OWN \"Queen Sized\" Bed - and this was the way it was. They would not allow us to have a roll-away in the bed - to gain additional sleeping space, with access to my handicapped relative, and they were not able to give us an additional room - with an adjoining door - as the hotel was sold out. We could not leave the handicapped person sleeping alone in any other room. The stay was a nightmare. We were unable to sleep with FULL Beds, and the management tried to make it seem like we were crazy to think they should have QUEEN beds. Clearly - the young manager has had no experience with a handicapped family member. He was VERY insensitive. In addition, the management was unavailable at all times that I was available. I had to leave the hotel room by 9:00 AM each day, and return later in the day - so it made it near impossible to discuss the situation.

We had an very comfortable bed with plenty of extra pillows, something you usually have to ask for upfront at most hotels in this price range. The parking is free and plentiful, also the hotel is located close to freeways and a large mall with a target store for all those items you forgot to pack. The pool is small, but clean and well kept. Our room was cleaned every day of our stay and the staff was helpful with anything we needed. I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone who wants to visit SF, but does not want to pay the high price of parking at the downtown hotels (we paid $7 each day we parked downtown, the hotels charge 4x that).

Parking is very bad, few spaces. Upper rooms accessed only by stairways or elevator on the far ends of the building, and parking spots often nowhere near your closest entry door. During our whole 3-day stay one outdoor was broken for keycard entry, meaning very long hike with luggage to room. Jaccuzzi was also busted for the entire stay. Morning buffet breakfast, far from free like many hotels is $10.99 a person!

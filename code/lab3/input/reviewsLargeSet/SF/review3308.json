I explained to the lady who answered the phone that my flight was arriving in San Francisco at 11:45pm. She said that the last shuttle leaves at 12:41am. I get there at 12:20pm and wait in the cold. All the shuttles were for all the other hotels. At 12:43am I make my first call to this hotel. I told the night clerk I was at the airport waiting for the shuttle. He told me that the last shuttle leaves at 12:48am. At 12:49am, I call the hotel again. He tells me that the shuttle will leave at 12:51am. Still no shuttle and I'm now the only person standing in the freezing cold waiting for a shuttle. I call back the hotel several times before the night auditor answered. When I asked about the shuttle he said that it would leave at 12:58am! At this point I lost my patience with him. I asked him why had he told me 3 different departure times and pointed out to him that it was 1:01am! There was no shuttle! When I called him back he told me that the shuttle driver just arrived and handed him the keys to the shuttle.

Only three hours later, a couple used another key to enter my room. The hotel assigned my room to them, again! When I was furious to confront the hotel vice manager (the manager was too busy on the phone), she explained to me that their system does not show that my room was taken. I insisted to change my room after that. The hotel never formally apologize to me and the manager never showed up. I think it is obviously that they do not care about customers.

The lobby however is pretty nice. When it comes to the room, overall it was pretty good. Don't even really know what to say, it looked like a normal hotel room. However, there were a couple of dissatisfying things about the room's cleanliness--in fact, now that I think about it, they were all in the bathroom. First of all, there was some kind of dirt on the inside of the door. Then, you could tell the maids clean the handle and faucet of the bathtub every time, because they were sparkling, but not the nozzle. Doesn't fall into one's line of sight as easily. Then--and this is total nitpicking--the soaps were tossed haphazardly onto their spot on top of the toilet tank. They were all either upside down or backwards. Not a big deal, but shows that the maids aren't really focused on attention to detail.\n\nI suppose the biggest issue was the towel bar on the front of the sink outside the bathroom. When I pulled a towel off to dry my hands it crashed to the ground. I replaced it gingerly.

I live an hour north of San Francisco and stayed in this hotel one night the Tuesday before Thanksgiving before flying out super early, and left my car parked at the hotel for six days.\n\nThis hotel was one of the cheapest, and so I had low expectations. And they were met. It's a one star. Staff was friendly enough. The room was not a place I'd want to spend any more time in other than to check in, sleep, get up, and check out. The sheets were very thin and there were stains on the carpet that I'm pretty sure were dried blood. I didn't need the earplugs I brought, but I did use my eyepatches because I'm pretty sensitive to light. I did not try the shower or TV.\n\nBefore booking this place, you should consider that the hotel shuttle runs about every hour. So like me, you could be waiting at the airport outside in the rain at night for close to an hour for your shuttle bus to arrive, while watching other, probably more expensive hotel shuttles go by several times (this hotel shares the shuttle with three other nearby hotels, too... can't remember which ones.) If this and a dingy room are ok with you, this hotel is a convenient way to park and fly.

No complaints about hotel, check in and out were both quick and painless. Only issue was no free internet. Wifi was available but at what seemed to be a bit too high of a price.

The lobby turned out to be the most attractive part of the facility and the place that appeared most appealing in the web photos. This place was nothing more than a motel that received a paint job in the rooms. The rooms while somewhat clean were very out dated. Fixtures in the bathroom were broken. The bath fan sounded like it was ready to blow. The bed covers were very old and faded and the mattresses must have been the originals since the place opened up 30 or so years ago and were very uncomfortable. Carpet was old & stained. I'm usually not to picky if the place is clean and comfortable but THIS PLACE WAS AN ABSOLUTE DUMP. The air outside smelled of fried fish & foods from the Chinese buffet on site. (we didn't eat there) The service was terrible. I had called to the front desk to order an ironing board and was told one would be brought to the room. I called a couple more times and waited 2 hours before walking to the lobby only to find out there were no more. I had also ordered a roll-away for one of our rooms only to find, at 1:30 am when we returned from an event, that it too had not been delivered. As I said I am not usually to particular if the place is clean and convenient. This place however is only convenient.

We had a similar experience next day when my partner called down for an iron. He called about a few time and was every time told it was on the way. He went down to the front desk and they didnt have any behind the desk but they were going to send one right over. He finally saw another guest with an iron and got it from them. Overall the CitiGarden has recently been remolded but very poorly. We had a chair that was so badly stained that no one felt comfortable sitting on it without a towel to covering the stain! Our bed was Queen size but looked more like a Full. The wedding was a blast but no thanks to our accommodations at this place.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":2,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":1,"ratingRoomComfort":1,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Los Angeles, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-08-19T15:20:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"3308","reviewId":"18643953","photos":[],"itinId":"283950861","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"David","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Reasonably Priced Airport Hotel","reviewText":"Hotel lobby and main building have been recently renovated.

I rather do the ten minute drive, get a free parking spot in front of my room and rest. It was a great place for me to stay since on my vacation I did not only go to San Francisco but other locations in northern California. In the morning they offer you cereal, orange juice, apple juice, coffee, toast, bagels, jam, butter and peanut butter.

My room was clean and cozy, towels were replaced everyday. It was enough to just come to sleep at night. My room came with its own heat/AC unit which was very useful during the chilly nights there. The best part was the free breakfast in the mornings. There was bread, mini bagels, cereal, milk, orange juice, apple juice, coffee, tea, butter and cream cheese. It was enough to fill up on to start off my day of exploring. The ladies who set up the breakfast spread were really nice and you should tip them! The only thing about this hotel that can be bothersome is its location. It's far from downtown San Francisco and you will have to figure out the best way to get there.

First night, after a long road from LA, we wanted to wash up and we only had 2 towels and one facecloth. We also needed extra pillows. We had to ask for all this 3 times because the girl at the front desk could never remember what we needed. In the evening of the second night, we wanted to wash our clothes and take a shower to go out for dinner. But they actually CUT the water supply for the hotel without notifying any of the guests because they were renovating. We had to delay our whole evening. Two hours later, they ran out of toilet paper. My spouse went down to the lobby and actually had to tell them to get some from the store. Third evening, after a night out on the town, we got back to our room and find out that there was no more HOT WATER. AAARGH !! The following morning we were awakened early by the lobby they had misprinted my credit card number. I might run out of space writing about our two other horrible nights so i'll cut to the end. When we finally met the hotel manager, he laughed at us saying that we were having quite an 'adventure'. I told him that actually we were having a nightmare.

I sent my son to the desk to fetch another, and they told him they would deliver one to the room. It took too long, and my teeneage daughter was finished with her shower long before towel arrived(if you have a teenage daughter, you know how long a shower can take, so the hotel had plenty of time). My second stay 2 weeks later, I could not find a place to park except far away in front of the Chinese Restaurant that is attached to the hotel. At midnight, there were other guests outside my door talking very very loudly. I called the desk, and they sent security to hush the people. I slept well. The third night, everything was great; Hot water, quiet, parking. I was also able to get an additional towel at the desk at the time of check-in. This is an inexpensive place to stay with a reliable shuttle to and from the airport. They offer a park-n-fly package. The continental breakfast is a joke, but there is an IHOP across the street, or bring your own fruit and nuts if you like light breakfast. The attached Chinese Buffet is good. It is very silly that the place has a pool in South San Francisco. When would it ever be warm enough to swim there?

Conclusion: If you dont mind to drive 15mins to your bed for a cheap nite, then this is the place for you.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Calgary, AB, Canada","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-06-26T08:27:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"3308","reviewId":"18643995","photos":[],"itinId":"278398790","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Ted","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Impressed","reviewText":"Excellent service, furniture, comfort, breakfest.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"New Britain, CT","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-06-18T00:37:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"3308","reviewId":"18644166","photos":[],"itinId":"279027415","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Lillian","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Nice","reviewText":"It was a very nice and clean hotel all around.

I have recommended this hotel to others and they've agreed its a great place to stay.\nThere's no charge for parking like most other airport area hotels. The lobby has a warm feeling that welcomes you to just hang out and read or watch tv. Checking in has been consistently simple. Takes just a few minutes.

The Elephant Bar down the street is the closest restaurant and bar without going to a competing hotel across the street. Otherwise, the hotel is right in the middle of the airport industry district.

The staff, from the desk clerks to the room maids and everyone in between, was friendly, helpful and very efficient going out of their way to make our stay more enjoyable. Everyone had a smile and seemed to enjoy his/her work. A highlight was the breakfast and large room with many tables and chairs, not always the case. There was a large selection of food which varied each day including a hot, fresh egg dish (omelets or scrambled or fried); breakfast meat (bacon or sausage or ham); make-your-own waffles; fresh fruit and, my favorite, fresh fruit salad; bagels, muffins, cereals; yogurt; and I'm probably forgetting something. Oh, and lots of good, hot coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and juice. This saved our family of four a substantial amount of money. Usually, we eschew the \"continental breakfast\" and eat out, adding about $40+ to our daily expenses.

Cleaning staff did a good job. Closet had nice regular wooden hangers. Conveniently located close to SFO and across the street from the water. So it was nice to take a walk along the water. Benches located along the walkway so you could watch the airplanes take off and land. In addition, close to 101 access. For those who enjoy In-n-Out, a new one just opened only a couple of minutes away on the other side of 101. Although recently opened in 2003, noticed some damaged and missing tiles near base of coffee island in dining are. Bathroom door in my room was not hung correctly. In order to close the door, had to use force. Front desk was friendly. Greeted with a smile. Though one night, staff did not answer phone promptly; took almost 5 minutes for someone to answer the phone. Overall, the negative items above are minor, so I would return to this hotel. If you're not looking for full concierge and dining service, this is a good place to stay.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Miami Beach, FL","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-05-04T06:09:58Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]}]}}}

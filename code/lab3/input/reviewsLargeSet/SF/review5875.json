Used to corporate chain hotels, it was nice to stay in a boutique hotel with a little more personality for a change. The room was small, but well appointed, which is what matters most to me.

It was nice to walk up Grant street on my way there and ogle the window displays of the high-end stores, and there are a number of restaurants around (though to be honest, I just ordered delivery to my room most nights, which was also a super easy process thanks to the text concierge services). My only small gripe is that the hotel is split above the 4th floor, and it can be a bit confusing to figure out how to get to rooms on and above the 5th floor the first time, so you might want to get a bellhop to show you up the first time if they tell you you'll need to take two elevators to get to your room!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"Lots of personality, free water bottle in the room, nicely appointed rooms, and great media/entertainment center.","negativeRemarks":"Better explanation of how to get to your room if you're on the \"other side\" above the 4th floor and/or a warning/option to NOT have that type of room.","locationRemarks":"Great location near Union Square if you're a tourist/into high-end shopping.

We were assigned room 723 at check in and had to work the maze to the other side of the hotel via 2 elevators. The room was very small but we figured that is normal for in the city location. However the noise above the room started right away and despite asking the staff to talk to the people above the room the noise continued. When we returned from dinner all was quiet so it seemed everyone upstairs were asleep. Unfortunately at 6:15AM the noise resumed and again we called for help. With the noise relentless I walked upstairs to find we were directly below the fitness center so that explained the continuous noise from above. Now we had to move and the hotel staff was most helpful and sympathetic to our cause. As it was our 32 wedding anniversary we had hoped for a nicer experience and day 2 provided this once the hassle of moving rooms was over. They put us into a very nice spacious suite and even sent us a bottle of champagne for our Anniversary and troubles. \r\n\r\nIt goes to show that there can always be problems but how one responds to the issues that makes the difference and this hotel responded in a first class way and converted us into a never again customer to one who recommends this hotel to others. \r\n\r\nI did suggest to the manager when I met him to either close room 723 to avoid future irate clients or offer deep discounts and tell the client up front about the gym upstairs. \r\n\r\n","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":1,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-04-13T15:49:47Z","roomTypeId":201439997,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":true,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5875","reviewId":"570dc06a1fcf7f09f8ab91f9","photos":[],"itinId":"1128547360396","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Bev","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great hotel in nice area","reviewText":"Met by doorman and glass of wine upon registering.

We moved around to a number of rooms to fix it and actually ended up in a larger room with a king bed at no extra cost.The hotel is done in a 70's theme and a lot of the common space while kitschy was not useful or comfortable and you would have to be into that to appreciate it. There were no food or beverages available although the idea is some type of café/bar area possibly opening up later this spring. Although plenty of stores and restaurants are all around the hotel. Rooms were a little small and sparsely furnished which made it difficult to navigate suitcases/cloths for more than a few days.

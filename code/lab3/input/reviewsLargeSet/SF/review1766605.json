The bathtub drain didn't work either. And the bath products brand was a cheap no-name.

Ghiradelli has a ice cream shop near Market street that does not have the same crowds as the one near the bridge. Took wine tour from hotel it is 20 degrees warmer outside the city.

When we checked in my son asked the front desk how many rooms were in the room the President stayed in.  They offered to provide us with a tour of the suite if we came back when it was free.  The kids (7 and 10) made sure that we checked back to see if that offer was still available.  When the room was clean they called our room and let us know that we could come and see it.  While we were waiting to go take a look Albania (the lady from the front desk) had a chilled canister of milk and cookies delivered to our room for the kids!  They thoroughly enjoyed their tour and were even given special memory books to document all of their special moments from their trip.  As a result we had a amazing dinner out that night.  The kids wrote in their memory books about the trip while waiting for their food to arrive and my husband and I enjoyed a glass of wine while the kids told us all about the fun they were having on their first trip to San Francisco.

There was only one thing that we really didn't like. The hotel is quite energy-conscious, which is fine, ut there was very little water pressure in the bathroom sink; this made it hard to rinse your toothbrushes, washcloths, etc. Also, when you turned the faucet handle all the way over to the right to get cold water, it ran quite hot for a long time before it finally became cold!

Room was clean and of a decent size. I was lucky enough to get upgraded to a club room on the top floor simply by asking. Unbeknownst to me, my room came with a buffet breakfast for two, but when I went to redeem it, they said it was only good for one person (even though two separate ppl, two separate occasions both confirmed it was for two). Buffet is ok. Food looks great, but like most buffets it's luke warm (one of my biggest pet peeves) and the taste was just ok. The fruit was fresh, and the bacon was tasty, but the french toast was as hard as croutons and the oatmeal brulee was soupy and bland. They did give me a bill the first day as apparently I should've gotten some vouchers (maybe at checkin?) and the buffet for two came to $60. If I had to pay I'd be upset. I ended up at Dottie's cafe a couple blocks away the next morning and would much rather spend my money there than at the hotel.\n\nThe checkin process was fairly pleasant but the front desk clerk tried to run my (prepaid) cc for incidentals and originally tried to put it through for the whole room amount/stay even though we paid ahead of time. That confused me and I had to try to ask a few times to be sure he was doing it right as it didn't make sense they would hold the amount for the cost of the room.

A large, working, nicely maintained hot tub next to the fitness room. The pool was long and narrow - basically two lap-lanes wide and long, but okay for kids as long as there aren't any fitness swimmers at the time.\n\nOn the downside, the \"I-Spa\" was overpriced and uneven. The facilities were nice, but the people were a disappointment. A \"couples\" massage cost almost $400 for the 80-minute massage. When I made the reservation, they told me \"$190\" and I figured that was for the pair of us, not each of us, since I pay $60 for a regular massage and medically-prescribed therapeutic massages cost $90. My girlfriend said hers was great. Mine was almost amateur and very disappointing.\n\nMost disappointinng of all was the Conceirge. We asked very specifically for a \"no frills, plain and simple Greek or Italian restaurant.\" She sent us on a $50 cab ride to a ridiculously pretentious italian restaurant.

Before checking in I was happy with the staff because I spent a lot of time speaking with the concierge reserving restaurants and booking some tourist things. Then we arrived and the complaints started piling up.\n1. We paid double by booking tours at the concierge than we would if we booked on our own. They should have informed us we can go directly to a pier to book a boat tour.\n2. We wanted to go to a particular famous seafood restaurant and the concierge told us they were completely booked. We tried the place anyway by just walking in and they had plenty of room.\n3. The mini fridge: we were informed when we checked in that the fridge has a sensor for all items and if we accidently touch anything we should just consume it because we'll get charged regardless. Obnoxious.\n4. Had a huge dinner one night with a lot of leftovers. Didn't want to throw all that delicious seafood away so we took everything back to the room. The next day we needed to heat it up and were charged $30 to get a microwave sent to our room!!! They said it was against the law for them to bring outside food into their kitchen and heat up for us.

Bed was very comfortable, pillow top mattress etc. Bathroom was modern excellent shower, despite the low flow water shower head. The location was perfect, near Market St. and a short walk to everything, union square is a few long blocks, but fine. I have stayed at the Fairmont and Palace hotels before and it is sometimes refreshing to have a new modern room/and hotel structure. However with that being said, the \"InterContinental\" does lack some character and \"joie de vivre.\" Sometimes these hotels get too \"corporatized\" and lack soul. The only restaurant is LUCE which is highly rated, but $28.00 (before tax) for a small breakfast buffet, come on, worth $18.00 tops. The parking is excessive, which can be avoided by driving around a few surrounding blocks to a more reasonable garage, such as the Mission Garage/5th St. at about $30.00 a day (with security) unless of course your car is exotic. Also the internet charges are a bit un-hip in this age of free wi-fi and especially San Fran being so internet savvy. I avoided this by taking my laptop somewhere else, and actually spending my money more locally. Obviously they focus on the \"expense account\" customer, but really those days are numbered as companies don't like being gouged either.

I was not put off by the contemporary decor like some reviewers. Yes, the hotel does seem like it was designed more for the business traveler than the tourist, but I appreciated the spacious room and lack of clutter. I am an amateur photographer and it was nice to have a large work area to connect to the internet and upload my photos to my computer. Very adequate lighting. The view was fine. I slept very well all three nights I was there. The noise from the street was very minimal. While the location of this hotel is a few blocks from Union Square, the walk is not bad at all. I know some Expedia reviews seem to indicate the walk might be a problem. And, it might be for those unable to walk a few blocks. The lower weekend rate and quality of this hotel more than make up for doing a little walking. The hotel is only a couple of blocks from the S. F. Museum of of Modern Art, which I highly recommend. I was a little disappointed in the lack of restaurants in the immediate area, but that is not a problem if you are willing to walk a couple of blocks toward the Union Square area.

Every piece of fitness equipment has an LCD TV for your viewing pleasure while you work out. The rooms are absolutely spacious and offer a great view of the city of San Francisco. If you're worried about cleanliness, you've found the right hotel! This hotel is clean as can be! It has a full size restaurant and bar called Luce. The menu options are great, but can get a little pricey. I believe for four of us just to have cocktails came to around $50, but well worth it. I plan on going to San Francisco a third time in a year or so and I will definitely being staying at this hotel!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Little Rock, AR","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-11-07T21:31:06Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"1766605","reviewId":"19072454","photos":[],"itinId":"342942999","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Anne-Lise","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Good service!","reviewText":"Nice hotel and very good service, but the location is not optimal.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"New York","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-11-03T13:35:33Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"1766605","reviewId":"19072426","photos":[],"itinId":"343054261","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"pamela","brandType":"Expedia","title":"great city hotel","reviewText":"excelent hotel, great staff, great views, very convenient","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-10-28T03:00:15Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"1766605","reviewId":"19072227","photos":[],"itinId":"339331093","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Bertrand","brandType":"Expedia","title":"San Francisco Approved","reviewText":"Prepared to receive all kind of customers.

(Warning: the minibar and water on the counter are expensive, and there is a notice letting you know that they will charge you if something in the fridge is even MOVED...if you bring kids, make sure you lay down some rules when you first get there).\n\nParking at the hotel was easy, but extraordinarily expensive....about 60 dollars a day! You'd be better off parking at the wharf and taking the bus to the hotel! That being said, the valets were always friendly and efficient.\n\nThe hotel is conveniently located to major bus routes, underground transit, and cable car, not to mention the beautiful and busy Westfield Mall (all within about a 5-8 minute walk).\n\nThe only thing you should know is that the hotel is located on a one-way street (Howard), about a block from a fire station. Which means that several times a night, you will hear multiple fire engines screaming down the street (at least for South-facing rooms). But hey, it's a big city, and you'd expect that sort of thing, right?\n\nOverall, we had a fantastic stay, and if you can get a good rate, TOTALLY worth it.

The staff is warm and accomodating. As I was a first time visitor travelling on my own I was fairly dependant on their advice and such. At no time did I feel like I was a bother. JD and Ray particularily terrific!\nThe hotel was in immaculate condition-everything was 'day one clean' and orderly.\nI ordered room service two times - although the first time it took nearly an hour (on the 4th of July right after the fireworks, I guess the didn't expext the rush) - the second time the food arrived promptly. Both times it was hot and delicious with a lovely presentation on a white tablecloth with a flower arrangement.\nThe location is my only critique of the hotel as it borders on a fairly sketchy part of town. But if you travel north up Howard you can avoid the 'iffy' zone! The hotel does manage to be just close enough to Union Square to be easily accesible but far enough to be out of the fray.\nOverall the ICSF has earned the position of my home away from home in SF.

One of the best things about The Intercontinental were the excellent staff, especially Ray the concierge (I feel he deserves specific mention)! He helped us book tickets to Alcatraz and to see \"Wicked\" at the Orpheum, helped us check in for the flight home, gave us information on how to use the Muni and maps to places we wanted to see.

The hotel places a $200 HOLD on funds from your credit card or debit for EACH DAY of stay. those funds are not available to you during this period of time. At the end of your stay, your actual expenses are then totaled any remaining balance from the frozen funds are released back to your card.\n2. The front desk service is mediocre. Not very friendly (although not rude) and I was surprised that no one ever even asked us why we were in SF. It would have been nice to be asked. When it comes to service, the little things count.\n3. The bar and restaurant are woefully inadequate to handle all of the conventioneers and other guests.\n4. Our room faced east and when the sun rose each morning, the room became hot. Not just warm. HOT. We had the thermostat adjusted to the lowest possible setting and the fan turned on \"high,\" yet we still roasted the morning of our wedding as we showered and dressed. We were told the hotel was booked to capacity, so no other rooms were available.\n\nWhile this may all sound very negative, we were not UNhappy with the hotel. But we won't choose it again.

With the exception of the concierge staff we were unimpressed by the service.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"San Diego, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-08-27T03:12:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"1766605","reviewId":"19072461","photos":[],"itinId":"288575000","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Bill","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Without a question, worth every penny.","reviewText":"From check-in to check-out, every aspect of our stay was perfect.

I love the modern, sleek styling, without it being too cold and stark. Also enjoyed is the feeling of a smaller hotel, with a cozy lobby, which does not give off the feeling of a typical business-oriented hotel. On my first trip, I was granted a very early check-in and an upgraded to an executive room which had breathtaking views. Super friendly valet and bell service, which made my first introduction to this hotel even more outstanding....I could not wait to go back. Their restaurant, Luce was exceptional and a true experience! A month later I did go back - this time for leisure. The hotel was absolutely busting at the seams. I waited in line @ 1pm for 20 min to check in, only to have them tell me my room was not ready (check in is @ 2pm, so I totally understood) - I waited around and gave a tour to my family. Back in line @ 2:15, waited for 15 min., again - no room ready! They said they would call me on my cell phone once it was ready. 3pm - still no call, waited in line AGAIN for a long while, until a friendly concierge grabbed me from line and got my room, delivered milk and cookies to my room. Attempt of correcting the situation. I am going back again this weekend - and hope service will return to what was displayed on my first journey there.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Lake Tahoe, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-08-26T18:19:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"1766605","reviewId":"19072325","photos":[],"itinId":"287056503","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Laszlo","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Good place to stay","reviewText":"Our three nights stay was very statisfactory, good location, good service.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Tepoztlan, Mexico","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-08-26T13:58:33Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Laszlo","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"1766605","reviewId":"19072350","photos":[],"itinId":"288386599","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Javier","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Perfect hotel","reviewText":"Excellent location, great service and the Concierge is helpful and friendly.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Mexico City","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-08-26T12:37:34Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"25","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_au","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"1766605","reviewId":"19072205","photos":[],"itinId":"910238","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"3081","userNickname":"Angela","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Classy, convenient and comfortable hotel","reviewText":"Our stay was faultless.

Frette robes, stylish and modern decor, absolutely beautiful bathroom, comfy bed, nice flatscreen, etc., etc. The lobby was also very swank and had a hip, lively atmosphere. I didn't eat at the hotel, but had a cappucino at the bar where the service was friendly. I pre-paid for 2 nights via a great deal on Expedia. At such a low price, I completely expected them to put me in a closet-sized room on the 2nd floor. Instead, I had a room on the 29th floor with a great view (with plenty of space).

The toilet wouldnt flush correctly and it took 3 to 4 times to actually flush.

All were buildings, shopping centers and a parking lots. However, the check-in officer was kind enough to let us go to see the other room on the opposite side by ourself. The view wasn't much different but facing the less attractive side of the city and had only bathtub without shower room, so we chose the first room offered. The room was less interesting than expected. It was furnished as modern as other 4-5 star hotels, but nothing was really special.

This was important because I had to call 3 times in an hour and half before I could get someone to come get it. The 1st time the recorded msg. said \"Your call is important to us; pls hold...\" After 25 minutes on speaker, I dialed \"Instant Service\", and they promised to send someone up. After 30 minutes of waiting, I tried Room Service again. There are only 3 ways to dial for a person in this hotel - Concierge (which closes @ 11), Room Service, and Instant Service (which is basically housekeeping and maintenance). Nothing in the room tells you how to dial for help with services, or the front desk, or whatever. I had another instance in which I had to dial 3 times to have a table removed. And I had another instance in which I ordered breakfast, and they lost my order. These things were enormously frustrating.

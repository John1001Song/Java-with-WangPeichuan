I would have preferred a nice place and would have paid a little more for one, but there wasn't one available that fit what I needed. If I had been here for a vacation or other fun reason I'd have been sad about staying here but I was here for different reason so it didn't matter too much.  I just needed a place to rest in between.  That said, room was dark and depressing and the hotel is lacking in even basic amenities and comfort--e.g., I kept stabbing my leg on the corner of the platform bed frame, which is very close to the wall, no way to avoid it as the room was very tiny and crowded barely enough space to walk. Dangerously hot water from the taps/shower. Not enough blankets. Towels are too small and low quality and not enough of them. There's no coffee pot provided, the refrigerator made noise all night and didn't even really work--nothing was cold even when we turned up the cold dial--no bag for putting dirty laundry when checking out.  No heat in the shower part of the bathroom. The air smelled dirty inside the room. Upside: The front desk people were very nice, and the location on Lombard is on the Presidio fork so set back from the main/busy street and therefore is fairly quiet at night.

It turned out the other way around.  There are no tourist shops nearby, and that was fine with us.  What was nearby was the Presidio, the Marina, The Palace of Fine Arts, and the restaurants and delis on Chestnut Street.  The bus that runs in front of the hotel can take you through the Presidio, then south past Golden Gate park, or, east far enough to catch another bus to Fisherman's wharf.  It's also a short walk from the hotel to the bus that runs up to the visitor center at Golden Gate Bridge, and assorted trails there.  I highly recommend getting a bus pass for however long you'll be there.\r\n\r\nThe hotel itself is an older hotel, but seems to have been remodeled in the last few years.  The bed was firm, and we slept very well.  The place was also quiet.  Our room had a refrigerator, but no coffee maker.  The \"continental breakfast\" seems to be more of an afterthought, but it was enough to get us going and out the door in the morning.  If your room has a refrigerator, you might want to take advantage of one of the small groceries on Chestnut.

This same guy was also eyeing us when we were outside waiting for our uber cab. \r\nWe were up early and office was closed and still no coffee to be had!!! At check out, a young male receptionist said he had already charged my credit card. My understanding is that the card I used is for holding. I wanted to use another card for the room charge. In addition, my friends and I were splitting the charge. He said they couldn't split the cost that it had to be on one card..REALLY!? I reserved two nights via on line and informed verbally that my GF's were staying an extra night and that they were going to pay separately. At initial checkin they said that would be fine..no problem. At checkout (morning of day 2) went to pay and the receptionist had already charged a 3rd night to my card without my consent!

The facilities were older but fairly well maintained, even the towels were surprisingly soft. Nice new TV. The room had AC/Heat which was a really welcome luxury after our first night in that nearby place that didn't offer the same. The reviews are true that parking is limited, we however did not encounter any issues finding a spot. Plus (travel tip), the desk manager was totally cool letting us park the car ahead of room check-in so we could go to explore the city.

Not here--just a clean, comfortable room in a quiet hotel with friendly staff. 5 or 6 spaces in the parking lot but you can park on the street too. Great for getting in to see the city. Backed up against the Presidio, right on Lombard. Walk a block down and one street over to Chestnut to catch the #30 bus straight to Fisherman's Wharf, Embarcadero, Financial District...also the #28 comes even closer and will take you west right to the Golden Gate Bridge. Close to a Walgreens, a pub and a Pluto's restaurant/salad bar. Good neighborhood. Continental bfast was pastries from some local bakery. I'd stay there again quick.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"San Antonio, TX","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-10-05T01:29:49Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"hotelId":"891239","reviewId":"20646255","photos":[],"itinId":"374758135","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Alison","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Nice hotel, great value in a nice neighborhood","reviewText":"If you are looking for a fancy hotel with all the amenities, this place is not for you. However, if you are looking for a nice, clean hotel on a budget then this is your place! The neighborhood is partly residential, nice and quiet. Our room was very clean and we were glad to see an iron & ironing board. The bed was comfy! There is a fridge but you have to rent it ($3/day).The staff are very nice. and they can arrange tours for you or a shuttle to the airport ($15/person). In the morning there is coffee, tea, juice, fruit and pastries at the front desk but because the area is very small you have to take your breakfast back to your room. No prob. There is no restaurant but there are plenty of eateries within walking distance. There are several buses in the area to take you downtown or to Fisherman's Wharf. There's also a Walgreen's drugstore 2 blocks away in case you forgot anything. I would stay here again.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Corona, NY","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-09-12T23:52:07Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Alison","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"hotelId":"891239","reviewId":"20646256","photos":[],"itinId":"386164382","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"jim","brandType":"Expedia","title":"No frills.....but clean and comfortable","reviewText":"This is a no-frills place, but it is clean and comfortable.

It isn't!  I haven't paid that much for a room that small since the Shinjuku Hilton in Tokyo.  The room was small and ordinary and what I would expect at a roadside motel.  The bath soap were the small bars like you find in cheap motels.  The towels were small and of low quality.  The internal rooms have a lovely view of the pool roof.  The finish of the rooms is shabby.  The Marriott is on the adjacent corner, and the Holiday Inn Express is in front.  Both are far better properties.  The hotel has a nice location but other properties in the same area provide more value for you dollar.

The room was a good size, the king size bed was so so comfortable and the cleanliness was to a high standard. The only minor issue is that instead of porcelain mugs to make tea and coffee - they use paper mugs. The following morning there was a protest outside the Hyatt - I think they were part of the Union and they were circling the Hyatt disrupting the guests and I think they were trying to sway the guests to get upset and ask for a refund or work us up due to the disruption. The Hyatt had security there and when a protestor approached me - I gave him a decent mouthful of my thoughts on a selfish protest that could have been dealt with management directly as opposed to innocent guests. A Hyatt staff member overheard this and offered sincere apologies about this protest, explained the situation then organised to have complimentary wine and food brought up to our hotel room with a hand written letter. We couldn't fault the staff or the hotel - the overall stay was exceptional and we would gladly return. The location is perfect, it is a safe area with lots of local attractions within walking distance like pier 39 and Ghirardelli Chocolate Factory. Lombard street is also around the corner.

For starters every morning at 7 AM we were awakened by a group of union picketers with a bull horn telling us to \"Boycott the Hyatt\" and \"No peace for customers\".  Next, after a nice evening out, as we are snuggling into bed, the hotel alarm alerted us to a fire emergency- we needed to vacate the hotel through the stairwells. We left our room, followed the other guests in search of the fire exit only to run into a maid who was clueless as to where the stairs were located.  Eventually we made our way to the lobby and told it was a false alarm, return to our room.  We returned to our room (3rd floor) climbed back into bed only to have the alarm go off again 20 minutes later.  This time we were able to get out much faster. We stood outside for another 15-20 minutes before the fire department gave the official \"all clear\".  Of course the next morning the boycotting bull horn returned at 7 AM.  Upon check out we spoke with the desk manager who was less than sympathetic telling us the Hotel has been picketed for the last 5 years (We have stayed here several times already and never witnessed any picket line).

The only positive that came out of this was the LOCATION. Its a  walking distance to the wharf, pier 39, and a lot of restaurants. I would still recommend this hotel for the location, because all of my issues are caused by the renovations. I would suggest, however, booking after all the renovations is over.

I also booked it for it's location. This did not disappoint. We went not wanting to mess with a car, and this location helped with this. We walked to everywhere in the warf, and some outside. We used the \"Hop On/Hop Off\" bus to get us everywhere else. This part was good.\n\nThe hotel itself was actually dirty. I had to tell the front desk to clean the lobby bathrooms because it was so filthy. Our room did not have a comfortable sitting area, and just was not comfortable as we are used to for a hotel of this price point. Other than bar soap, we had to call for other hygiene items that are typically provided in the room.\n\nThere was only one ice machine per level, which seemed to be insufficient with the amount of rooms per level. The pool and hot tub were nice. The biggest frustration was the elevators. The one that took you to the front counter level was always slow and packed. We would have preferred to just take stairs, but there were none around. The elevator was our only choice.\n\nIt was ok, but I felt like I was at a budget hotel rather than the Hyatt. I would recommend this hotel only for the location.\n\nTip: Did not eat breakfast there, but the Hollywood Cafe across the street was the best breakfast I think I ever had at a reasonable price!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"The location was perfect!

That means a wait while you drop it off and a wait while you pick it up, and you can't leave anything in there you don't trust the valets with. The Concierge was not at the desk even though I waited for 10 minutes. The TV is set up to look like there are free movies and pay movies (what else would \"premium\" vs. regular mean?) but after you spend time looking for a regular movie want to see and select it, then they tell you there is a charge --which is more than you paid to see the movie in a theater when it was new.\n\nThe shower head was in the ceiling instead of coming out of the wall. You know, one of those really stylish showers designed to make it hard to get the soap out of your pits and groin because anything unusual is stylish, no matter how uselsss. And this shower had an extra bonus. Someone cleverly built the stall so that you have to stand under the shower head to turn the water on. It is impossible to turn it on without getting splashed by cold water even if you are tall enough to reach the shower head and redirect the spray. My roomy is petite and she had to get the full spray of cold water in order to turn it on, because she couldn't reach the head to move it to the side.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"good location near fisherman's warf","negativeRemarks":"let people park their own car install plumbing designed for functionality rather than stylishness","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2014-03-23T22:02:21Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"hotelId":"22500","reviewId":"67829903","photos":[],"itinId":"167237537208","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[{"isFlaggable":false,"userNickname":"GuestRelationsAssociate","displayLocale":"en_US","date":"2014-09-26T13:15:17Z","id":"1004533","response":"Good Afternoon!\n\nThank you for taking the time to share your feedback on your most recent visit to the Hyatt Fisherman's Wharf.

They have a concierge and a welcome desk with a few chairs. The staff was very friendly and advised there were no rooms available at 12pm (early anyway). Came back a short time later and was given a 5th floor room with a view of the pool.\n\nThe room (just like the lobby) needs updating. The furniture was old and showed signs of wear and tear. The bathroom had a cracked sink along with a few cracked tiles. The bed was horribly uncomfortable. For a \"four star\" hotel they need more comfortable beds then an old spring-style bed. The couch and desk in the room had stains and dust present as well. The window held out no noise and could hear every word said from the pool area to the 5th floor.\n\nParking is expensive! The attached restaurant is so-so and no amenities outside of the lobby unlike the fire pits and other outdoor seating seen at other \"2 and 3 star\" hotels.

This isn't a matter of the day just being active, but you can see layers of grime in the corners of the elevators that clearly were not taken care of for a long time. The hallways are not much better. The walls show many scrapes and blunt hits from what I hope are the luggage carts, but it's apparent that these have been there for a very long time and the walls need to be treated/repaired. The hallways are too dark, making you wonder what the lack of light is hiding.\nThe concierge is no help if you want to choose a restaurant or go to see something other than the wharf.

Another issue I had was the outdoor hot tub and pool. I was looking forward to the hot tub after a long walk from dinner on a Saturday night. I put on my suit and went to the 4th floor area and entered the hot tub, but I was told to leave after only a few minutes. Why? Because the pool and hot tub are closed at 9. It was about 9:15. It is poor service to advertise amenities and have them so restricted - 9:00 on a Saturday in San Francisco?

I am from the Bay Area so this was lost on me but I'm sure some people are enchanted by this. Checkout was similarly frustrating.

The hotel and restaurant staff were very friendly and helpful. The conceirge was friendly and provided some great restaurant recommendations - one seafood at the wharf and one in chinatown. I thought the hotel was reasonably priced for comparable hotels. We had their breakfast buffet at Knuckles, the hotel restaurant on two mornings. The food was very good with many choices and was also reasonably priced at $20pp compared to the other comparable hotels we stayed which had a high of $32pp. We saw many other families with all aged children staying at the hotel. Only negative comments were the hallway and room carpeting could use some updating and the green paint in the hallway made it them seem a little dark. The lobby and other common areas of the hotel were very nice. Walked out to see the pool but did not have time to use it - people at pool areas seemed to enjoy it.

That being said room was clean, quiet and beds were very comfortable. The area is very safe for walking anytime of the day so that met all our families needs. We had breakfast every morning in the hotel restaurant (offers large buffet) and the food was good.

I had always stayed in Hilton hotels and thought this one would be comparable. Well, it didn't come close.\nThe bathroom door wasn't even a real door. It was two sliding doors and you could see daylight around it. No privacy. My husband would leave to use the lobby restroom. The shower had marble on the floor, big safety issue there, and the shower head was mounted to the ceiling of the shower so it poured down on your head. It was almost impossible to rinse my hair without feeling like I was drowning. Since there was no curtain or door on the shower, you had to reach around a glass partition to turn on the water and there was no way to not get wet doing that. Also, there was no hook or knobs or anything to hang clothes or a towel on in the bathroom. You couldn't hang up your towel to dry so it could be re-used.\n\nThe whole place needs an over-haul. Period. The only redeeming quality was the staff. They were incredibly friendly and went out of their way to make our stay worry-free. The concierge was friendly and knowledgeable.

There is only one small lift accessible from the registration lobby. It operates on the same calling system as the main bank of lifts and it's impossible to call this lift independly. Subsequently it never shows up when required. Room itself was fine but lacking in information that is vital to travellers. No rates or details for the use of the in-house phone system, no information about internet rates or business centre access. no information on the location or even presence of a guest laundry etc. The furniture was looking a little bashed about and there were no luggage racks availble to place luggae on ( a problem we found in most US and Canadian hotels). Minor details but they show an overall lack of attention to detail. No minibar or refrigeration available. A coffee maker was available but only one paper cup for two occupants and this was never replenished in the whole week we were there. No refrigeration means no milk for tea or coffee and no method of boiling water for tea other than using the coffee maker which taints the tea water. Similar issues with the steam iron - nothing to use to fill it with water.

There is a bar/restaurant attached to the hotel where you can get breakfast but we chose not to , instead we walked across the street to the \"Hollywood Cafe\" and had breakfast , the menu had the usual pancakes , omelette , bagels etc and very reasonably priced. We were less than a 5 minute walk from pier 39 , we also had a bus stop on the street which we rode to take a look around Pacific heights , we even walked to Lombard and the \"crookedest street\" from the hotel which took around 15 minutes. A lot of reviews I read on this hotel before booking mentioned street noise , we had a room that overlooked the street and the cafe across the street and I have to say that street noise did not keep me awake , from around 6/6.30am the traffic becomes more frequent but not so much that you can hear nothing else , and if you are staying in any Wharf location hotel you are going to have the same issue. Overall I would say that this is a great location and a great city to visit , even with young kids.

The negatives, FOR THIS PRICE, are the small room, tiny bathtub, NO view of ANYTHING but other sides of building, no refrig., and you pay FOR EVERYTHING...and I mean EVERYTHING extra...including internet service. Only one restuarant which I would not recommend, no store, and no indoor pool. Also, we asked for a poolside room which we did not receive. However, you can literally walk to everything you need (breakfast restuarants, Drug store, all muni transportation means, wharf, stores, etc). Strongly recommend you buy a muni pass for 3, 5, or 7 days as you can ride ALL transportation except double-decker buses and BART. Great plaace for fish and dinner is Alioto's on the Wharf and cable cars located right behind hotel. Muirs Woods and Alcatraz are good tours. Television stations are terrible, so I would bring a portable DVD player and tapes unless you want to spend 15. for a movie.

I understand parking in SF is expensive but if you're already a hotel guest I don't see why you should pay so much to use a lot that is owned and operated by the hotel itself.\n\nThe room was nice. We chose an oversized room and we were glad because with me, my wife, and our 2 kids we could use the extra space. A regular room would have been cramped. However, the beds were way to soft for my taste and for my wife as well. I had a sore neck when I woke up in the mornings. The beds weren't old but just very soft which I know some people like but was horrible for me.\n\nFinally, the restaurant in the hotel, Knuckles, had good food for breakfast but is on the expensive side.

When I told him I did, he immediately helped me find a safe place to park my motorcycle and he assisted me in unloading my bags and finding my room. My room was luxurious. It faced the pool and it couldn't have been nicer. I loved the modern decor, and the bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept in. The \"rain shower\" was just the thing to wash off the road grit, and I then kicked back, relaxed and watched a first run movie, which was included with my room.

We arrived on a Friday evening and were given a room next to the pool/spa area with a large window that was largely obscured by a very large black tarp-covered repair project complete with bright orange traffic cones and ugly pipes. It was a very depressing and unacceptable view. We immediately went back to the front desk and talked with the staff who said they were very sorry, but the hotel was sold out and they would see if they could move us the next day. When we checked with them the next day, they were unable to do that either, so we endured two nights in one of the worst rooms we have ever stayed in. The layout was uncomfortable and the decor very dull, with grays, blacks and browns in varying patterns, not inviting and conveying no sense of warmth. The walk-in shower had a glass door that only covered half the opening, so it was drafty and cold. I called the front desk to see if they at least offered bathrobes upon request and was told that they do not. The other frustration is that the hotel charges $45 per day for parking, whether you use the valet or self-park. That seemed to us to be a ridiculously high amount. We took photos of our view of the construction mess and showed it to the front desk manager, who did agree to waive our parking fee as an apology.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":1,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Oregon","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-01-28T00:22:55Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"25","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_au","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"22500","reviewId":"18152788","photos":[],"itinId":"850198","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"3081","userNickname":"Colleen","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Friendly, Helpful and Great Location","reviewText":"The day we arrived at the Hyatt at Fisherman's Wharf, we had to return our car to the airport.

We stayed at the Hyatt at Fisherman's Wharf from Sept. 15 through the 23, 2009. The weather is awesome this time of year. There were two possible room types that we could choose from and we were given keys to both to access and decide. There was a larger room with 2 double beds, and a slightly smaller room with a king. We chose the king. Comfy beds! We requested & got a fridge. The pool was heated to 82 degrees. It's 3 to 3 1/2 feet deep. The hot tub was not huge, but cozy. It was a nice place to chat with others also. Other visitors also liked the hotel. Our desk clerks & consierge were helpful with suggestions for some meals. They also helped with which bus connections to use on our adventures. The consierge also helped us navigate with the MUNI transportation system to get to places like Golden Gate Park. (FYI: No bus stops IN the park, but go through the park, get off the bus on Lincoln and walk back into the park.). We visited the Japanese Tea Garden at the park.

The bar and restaurant can be very lively and noisy at weekends and is probably not the place for a romantic dinner but it has a great atmosphere. The concierge is very knowledgable about local restaurants and has never recommended one we have not been delighted with. The hotel is ideally placed for public transport - a couple of blocks from FW and the ferry to Sausalito, an F line street car stop a short stroll away (takes you along the Embarcadero and onto Market Street with connections to other lines or buses to take you to attractions like Golden Gate Park), the number 30 bus to Union Square (just a block from China Town) goes up Columbus (a couple of minutes away), get the 30 going the other way to the Marina District and the Exploratorium and there is a cable car turnaround just round the block from the hotel on the Powell-Mason line.

After doing extensive research for reasonably priced locations in San Francisco, my fiance and I decided upon this Hyatt. I'm glad we did. We had a fabulous honeymoon without emptying our bank accounts. The staff went out of their way to make sure we had a wonderful honeymoon stay at their hotel. I'd give them five stars on cleanliness, but I'm exceptionally picky about hotel cleanliness and I'm not positive they changed our sheets and pillowcases every time we wanted them to. For breakfast- you HAVE to go across the street to the Hollywood Cafe. (Of course, this is after you've tried brunch at Mama's near Peter and Paul Cathedral.) It is much cheaper than the hotel's brunch and is at least as good if not better. The eggs benedict and fresh fruit were amazing. From this Hyatt a lot of the touristy sites are walking distance (from Ghirardelli Square to Fisherman's Wharf to Pier 39). It's a bit of a walk, but you could even walk to the Alcatraz ferry. Several bus and cable car stops are around the corner that will take you straight to Golden Gate Bridge or Chinatown. The Legion of Honor takes two transfers on the bus, but is well worth it.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Atlanta, GA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-09-23T14:33:54Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"22500","reviewId":"18152581","photos":[],"itinId":"284136557","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Robin","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Very nice!","reviewText":"We really enjoyed our stay at the Hyatt.

Also, the shower doors did not close. It was just a glass enclosure that extended halfway around the shower and that led you to spill water all over the floor. The sink was really shallow and more often than not, I spilled water all over myself and over the counter. Another thing I didn't like was the extravagant parking fee and the wifi fee. Other than that, my room was very clean and everyone who worked there was very helpful. The hotel was close to everything we wanted to see and do as well as close to the cable cars, which was a big plus. I did not eat at Knuckles, so I can't comment on that restaurant.

They also have a heated swimming pool and jacuzzi so you can still go swimming while fighting off the chills from those Bay breezes.

Downside, in our room, there was a sliding door to the bathroom that didn't lock, so it became a constant game for our 18-month old to open and close the sliding door. Also, the food at the restaurant was really fast-food, fried and terrible. Could not believe this was California! Thankfully I found a nearby Trader Joes to get a few things for the baby during the day. Neither room had a refrigerator, so I kept the baby's milk in ice buckets. A fridge would have been useful.

Very well located, right in the heart of Fisherman's Wharf but I was generally disappointed. Turned off by the $5.00 price tag on bottles of water that were left in the room for us (Aquafina water that has been proven to be no better than tap water). Also by the $7.00 price tag on 15 minutes of internet use when the hotel across the street offered free internet. My friend accidentally selected a pay movie on the tv and tried to cancel it but the second you select something, you can no long \"deselect\" it. That cost us almost $15.00 and I was charged approximately $10.00 for a long distance call that took no longer than one minute. I had read on this site that the staff was so friendly but frankly I was not impressed. The concierge was alright but was not particularly generous with his time. I wasn't expecting him to spend hours with me but when I asked one question, I felt like I was imposing to ask a 2nd question. Another thing I didn't like were the dark hallways. It seems that a couple of lights would make it a bit more cheery. On the positive side, the rooms were very clean, the beds were extremely comfortable, and the gym, although much smaller than I'd been led to believe, was still pretty serviceable. I would recommend this hotel, due to the location, cleanliness and reasonable price, but would caution people to prepare for the way they try to grab you for every extra dollar that they can.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Montreal","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-01-21T18:30:40Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"3","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_gb","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"22500","reviewId":"18152532","photos":[],"itinId":"18832317","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"2057","userNickname":"Stephen","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Excellent Wharf Hotel worth a visit.","reviewText":"Fantastic wharf hotel.

The Powell-Mason cable car is right at the SE corner. Very convenient if you dont mind waiting in line for 0.5hr to get on it during peak hour. There are many bus/streetcar stops within 1 blk. Before we arrived, we have heard of many shower room story from web-reviewers. But it turned out they gave us a room with bathtub so that was even better! There was no bar fridge in the room. We asked and they put a complementary bar fridge in the room at no charge. They would charge you heavily for the bottled water though (a bottle cost $5). But we get around it just fine by stopping at Safeway or Walgreen to buy water (1.5 blks away). And even if we did not stay at this hotel, we would have done the same anyway. At night I could not hear any street noise. The only thing you could hear was the AC unit turning on/off by the thermostat but it was not bad. They never give you enough sugar for the in-room coffee or may be most people do not need more than 2 packets per cup? But we found that the staff responded promptly to our request. When asked for more sugar or more towels at the pool, the staff would come by in 5 mins.

The location was great as we were two blocks from touristy Fisherman's Wharf and two blocks from the end of the Powell Trolley line. As far as the hotel itself, we were travelling with our ten year old so we had specific ideas in mind. For instance, this hotel advertised a children's video/play room, but there wasn't one so this was pretty disappointing. You could rent video games for 2 hour blocks from your room, but we don't like for him to play video for that long and the whole point was to let him get out of the room for a few minutes and develop some independence in a safe environment. Also, the bar and bar food were ok, but nothing spectacular. The service was slow, but polite. The rooms were nice, but the beds were a disappointment. The hotel should turn the matresses because there are troughs in the beds. Overall, based on location and price, we would stay here again without our son.

If you are price-sensitive (and who isn't?), and the difference is significant to you, you may want to go for the lower cost. One critique - people tend to leave their room-service dishes outside the room and they do not seem to be picked up in the evening so they are there in the morning (I got up at 7 am). Not a lot of it, but noticeable. Ask for breakfast buffet coupons. We did not have them (booked as part of an Expedia package), but a lot of other people did.

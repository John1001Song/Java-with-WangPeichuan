A nice dining area with a free hot breakfast in the mornings.  Very friendly and helpful staff.  Unfortunately we scheduled our holiday in San Francisco at the same time as a huge convention (apparently pharmaceutical companies) so the hotels - including this one - doubled and tripled their rates.  For the amount charged, it would have been nice to have a room with a decent view and perhaps a small refrigerator and micro-wave (none provided).   It was nice to have an in-room coffee-maker, but we weren't supplied with enough creamers for more than 2 cups of coffee.  The beds seemed somewhat small, perhaps double beds instead of queen, and the fitted bottom sheets were smaller still, coming loose from the mattress during the night.  The comforters were tucked into the foot of the bed so tight it was like being short-sheeted, unable to pull the covers up over your shoulders without  pulling out the covers from the foot of the bed.

There were a lot of homeless people out there strolling the streets at night as common for a large town but we felt very safe inside, especially after dark.

Their (hotel) parking rates are astronomical.\n\nIt's a less expensive hotel, so as I should have expected, not all of the guests were as courteous as I'd have liked. Children playing in the elevators and running them up and down floors and I was woken up at 3:00am with people yelling in the hallway.\n\nThe staff were polite and responsive to the yelling when I called. There seemed no point in saying anything about the kids playing in the elevators - that's a parental issue. The staff were always polite and it was clean. If staying in the area again I would be more inclined to pay for a more expensive hotel. The 45 for parking per day put the bill right up rates of other places nearby.\n\nBreakfast was a pleasant suprise. It was much better than a tiny day old pastry and coffee. It was a realsonably nice spread - but there was a sign that seemed to indicate that this was some sort of trial.\n\nOverall, not horrible, but for the price and considering the extra charges, I plan to stay elsewhere the next time I am in town.

The Express hotels include continental breakfast. The breakfast area was jam packed with people. After the first morning, we tried the Hollywood cafe just down the street. It was great.\n\nOur king bed room was by far the smallest I have seen a H.I. hotel. Overall, room was ready updating. The bathroom had noticeable wear. The TV was an old CRT and had very few channels. We spent most of the 3 night trip sightseeing, so it wasn't a huge disappointment. On the plus side, everything worked.\n\nThe room doors shut very loudly. We were woken up in the morning to neighbor guests leaving. There was no way to shut the door quietly. The cleaning crew came to our door at 8:30AM on the first day.\n\nLocation is the biggest benefit to this hotel. It was a short walk to Ghirardelli Square and cable car terminal. We were near end of the F-Market and Wharves streetcar line.\n\nThe front desk suggested a town car service to take us back to the SFO airport. I would highly recommend this instead of using a taxi. The price is within a few dollars and the quality of service is substantially better. As with any hotels in SF, parking is not free.\n\nThere is a pool, but it is outdoors. The exercise room included a few treadmills, ellipticals, and stair climber.\n\nOverall, this hotel was decent for our vacation in SF. From past experience w/ H.I., we came in expecting a little nicer condition and amenities, but we were satisfied.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"Location","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Salem, OR","reviewSubmissionTime":"2013-03-23T16:37:37Z","roomTypeId":274637,"userDisplayName":"BN","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"4","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_ca","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"578899","reviewId":"50373192","photos":[],"itinId":"155585641406","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"4105","userNickname":"Rowena","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Perfect location","reviewText":"Good:\nGood location\nClose to all transportation\n\nBad:\nSame Manu for breakfast Buffett everyday\nOnly banana for fruit everyday\nNo wifi in room, only at lobby","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"Location","negativeRemarks":"No wifi in room","locationRemarks":"Close to fisherman wharf and all transportations","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Vancouver, BC, Canada","reviewSubmissionTime":"2013-03-22T17:18:44Z","roomTypeId":274637,"userDisplayName":"Rowena","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"578899","reviewId":"50287790","photos":[],"itinId":"154927855466","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Kristen","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great spot for a family vacation!!","reviewText":"The location of the hotel was great for site seeing and exploring the city!!

Great location (Fisherman's Wharf, two street cars, and the historic trolley line are all right there). The room was fine (clean, quiet, not smoky), and as advertised, but nothing special. Front desk staff were friendly and efficient. We were checked-in hours before the official check-in time (11AM), and got a late checkout (2 PM) without incident. Free breakfast was surprisingly good. Not your usual inedible danishes and coffee, but a full spread, including eggs, bacon, freshly made pancakes, edible danishes, etc. I appreciated that parking was unbundled, so I didn't have to pay for that service when traveling without a car (but it's not cheap if you have one). One drawback is that few of the rooms have a view, with many rooms looking out on nondescript interior courtyards.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"Location, Breakfast","negativeRemarks":"No View","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Hong Kong","reviewSubmissionTime":"2012-12-21T19:38:29Z","roomTypeId":274640,"userDisplayName":"Greg","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"hotelId":"578899","reviewId":"42620986","photos":[],"itinId":"152688453531","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"San Francisco Holiday Inn Express","reviewText":"The hotel has had an upgrade in the last 4 years because we stayed there in 2009 and there were definite improvements.

A coffee machine but no fridge (which will be supplied on request). View into central cement courtyard. We arranged for a change of room, which they happily did for an increase in tariff. Top floor. Great view to Alcatraz. Microwave, fridge, sink. Similar decor but not as good condition with quite a few signs of wear. Old style TV with few channels.

Service staff very gentle , helped us with all our needs. Tips: parking is extremely expensive in that area, but you can park at Enterprise car rental parking lot for less than half the price of hotel's. Also, if you rent a car at Enterprise, they allow late returns (until 11:00 PM), charging a little extra for that. It's just 2 blocks away from the hotel. Another cool thing to do is to rent a electric bike from Plugz, just beside the hotel entrance.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Sao Paulo, Brazil","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-03-27T14:17:57Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"578899","reviewId":"17976466","photos":[],"itinId":"358024453","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"jane","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Next time I want better weather.","reviewText":"Flight cancelled due to Tsunami, rebooked next day.

The complimentary breakfast was definitely the best we have ever had at a hotel offering this, and there was a large area with plenty of tables to seat all the guests. The location was ideal for access to all the tourist sites in the fisherman wharf area, being just 2 or 3 blocks away. We were also just a few blocks away from the hop on/hop off bus system we used to travel around the city. We had also booked a Napa Valley tour and discovered this tour office was located next door to the Holiday Inn Express.

The first night I barely slept because of how loud the hotel was. I could hear people opening and closing their doors, people running through the hallways and even the sound of the elevators. I was also upset to discover that my room looked out onto a concrete courtyard -- so I had no view at all. I probably could have asked for another room -- but I was too tired to be bothered. My final issue was the morning I was meant to check out I had ordered a shuttle to the airport. When the shuttle arrived early, the front desk called me. But the phone was broken in my room, so it seemed that no one was on the other end. I repeatedly said \"hello, hello, I can't hear you\" -- but when I came downstairs the front desk person said he had sent the shuttle away because I didn't come downstairs as soon as he called me.

To be fair, it's difficult to find parking places within the area. The overall environment of the area wasn't very pleasant for people like to take a stroll in the streets -- definitely not a place for jogging after dark (at least not well illuminated).\n\nThe services was fine DURING our stay (aka no more surprises), but not until we were about to leave. The surprise came in the morning before check out -- the bill showed a list of unconnected calls, each one billed for $5.61. We were sure those were unconnected calls because all of them were made by my wife to my cellphone and I always called back each time. When I argued at the front desk, the \"assistant manager\" on duty used various ways to justify those charges until I told her I had evidence on my cellphone. At that time, she became very rude and said that it was AT&T (the phone carrier of the hotel) that should be blamed and that I would still have to pay. After heated negotiation, she offer to charge for one call, which I didn't think was reasonable at all. Her next offer was to charge all of them. By the end, I was forced into an agreement (I truly didn't want to ruin my day for $5.61) to pay for one call, which was still totally outrageous to me.\n\nNow you see how this hotel does business or provide services.

The public transportation is abundant.\n\nThe gal at the front desk was not very welcoming and a bit cranky. So we get to deal with that immediately after the parking thing! And of course we're given an interior room.\n\nThe hotel is rectangular with outward facing rooms and interior rooms. The interior rooms faced the other side of the hotel and other rooms' windows. We had to keep the shades closed and it was like we didn't even have a window.\n\nThe room was small, which I understand is not unusual for SF. There were no extras in the room, but that didn't matter to us since we weren't planning on spending our vacation in a hotel room.\n\nOne last negative before I get to the positives....the hot part of the complimentary breakfast was inedible.

The room size can best be described as \"European\", which means you'll have just enough room to display your Dutch clogs between the bathroom and bed... but that's about it. There's no fridge in the room either.

The staff kept the food items replenished quickly. The only surprise we had was the size of the room. It was smaller than we anticipated. We had one queen bed and I was expecting a larger room. But we spent most of our time sightseeing, so it was no big deal. The room was very nice and the staff quickly supplied us with extra towels whenever we asked.

There was always enough food to eat and although there was lots of people there was enough seating. You can take food back to the rooms. Also a coffee maker in room with tea and coffee sachets. Check out took a while as there was only one staff member on and a couple people waiting. Staff were always friendly and helpful. Housekeeping kept the hotel clean. Very close to Walgreens for food/drinks. Fishermans wharf very close, but not too close! Easy access to the cable cars, tourist buses and taxis. Got the BART from the airport and walked along the embarcadero. nice walk but not quick. $8.50 taxi ride back to the Bart station. Don't take your car if you don't have to. Hotel has valet parking costing over $40 a day. You dont need a car as San Francisco has a good public transport system. On the same street as five star hotels. This is not a 5 star. Does not have concierge (is next door at original holiday inn) or people to take your luggage, which was fine with me. Use the free maps available on the streets to get around the city.

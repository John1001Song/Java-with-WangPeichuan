It was just what I was looking for: perfect location- walking distance from pretty much everything, cool decor in a non- chain hotel. It was definitely pricier than a lot of other options,  but given the location and the appearance of the hotel, it appeared worth it. \r\nCheck in was typical of any hotel.  It's situated on just three floors making it easy to get around.The room looked just as cool as the photos,  but given the price I expected more than the basics.Two little bars of soap,  small lotion, and refillable bottles of body wash and shampoo/conditioner attached to the wall. There was a small fridge and a coffee maker with a couple creamers and sweeteners. The bathroom was clean, but not as cared for as expected. The bedding was wonderful; I could have stayed in bed all day if there wasn't so much to do! \r\nI didn't dine at the hotel or use the store, so I cannot comment on those. There is a peaceful outdoor area in the middle of the hotel, which the fitness center looks out on. I did use the fitness center once.  It could use some lighter weights but other than that it had a good variety of equipment. \r\nThe only issue I had during my stay was the noise level.  It sounded as if the windows were open because I could hear conversations taking place on the sidewalk below, including being woken up by a man yelling obscenities to himself which carried on for some time. \r\nOverall,  cool looking hotel with basic amenities in a great location.

But there are a few major discomforts that would keep me from ever staying there again. It's not a good choice for light sleepers. The rooms have single pane windows and it sounds like the street noise is happening inside your room with you. We could hear conversations that were taking place below on third floor room, and there was a lot of traffic. I travel with a very loud noise machine, but it wasn't enough to drown out the traffic sounds. There are also no curtains--just wooden slat blinds that don't close very well, so a tremendous amount of light came into the room and there was nothing we could do about it. Light within the room was also a problem: all of the lamp shades were made of clear glass. They looked really cool--until you turned the lights on and were blinded. I was also very disturbed that clean towels and bath cloths are stored in wire baskets on the floor in the bathroom--right beside the toilet.

My only complaint is that room service employees are extremely loud in the morning to early afternoon. They tend to talk to each other loudly or watch loud videos on their phones. The walls are very thin so you can hear everything. Near the end of our stay, the kids that came in to the room across the hall were really loud and noisy which ruined our good stay. You can hear noises from other rooms such as when they open/close the bathroom door or if they stomp around. Other than that I loved the hotel. Besides the times when it was noisy, it's usually very quiet and empty in the halls and lobby. It wasn't as empty later on when it was the weekend though.

We've vacationed in England, Wales, France, Germany, Italy, Chech Republic, Holland, Austria, China, and Taiwan; and, there isn't enough room to list all the states we've been to so that's saying a lot for the hotel.  The Concierge was especially helpful with her restaurant and recreation recommendations (California Academy of the Sciences...kids loved it!).  It was Thanksgiving day and we used Uber for our ride from and to the airport.  Our wait for Uber was only 1 minute to get back to the airport, something the driver attributed to the hotel's prime location.

Unfortunately, the accommodations were less to be desired.  The hotel is currently under construction...and I do mean construction. Hallway floors were lined in plastic, no way to avoid the smell of paint or the hammering and drilling which began promptly at 8 AM without fail (even on the weekends).  I understand that they are trying to renovate the hotel but it's really too bad that they couldn't just close the hotel and finish the work all at once. It was awful.\r\n\r\nGetting to the gym was a problem as well.  It was open but you just have to figure out how to get there around the construction. No signs were available to redirect guests and I overheard several other guests complain about this as well.  The room was nice, but as long as they are renovating, why not consider double pane windows instead of offering a cheap dime store pair of ear plugs (which were set by the night table).  The shampoo and conditioner dispensers were empty as well. I would have called to request them to be filled but I didn't even realize they were empty until I was in the shower the next morning after we checked in. Overall, it was one of the worse places I have stayed as far as comfort. Definitely would not recommend this hotel to anyone right now. Maybe things will improve after the renovations...I hope.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":2,"ratingHotelCondition":1,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"The hotel is in a good location.

The location is a huge win down at Fisherman's Wharf.  You are literally steps away from restaurants, shopping, Starbucks, Walgreens and the famous San Francisco Fisherman's Wharf.  Hotels are expensive in San Francisco and we found Pier 2620 to be a great value.  The room was decent.  Nothing spectacular.  It could have been a bit cleaner in terms of the carpet and the bathroom.  The beds were very comfortable and the sheets very clean with new fresh linens.  The bathroom had seen better days and all surfaces could have use a better wipe down. You wanted to keep your shoes on when it came to the carpet.  I can't be too hard as they are in the process of renovating the hotel and our room was one of the older ones.  Overall we found it quite comfortable.  It had a very nice large flat screen tv and a fridge to store drinks and snacks we bought outside of the hotel.  If you want to buy snacks to keep in the room there is Safeway, Trader Joes and Walgreens all a block or two away.  The Main Lobby is beautiful.  The staff were friendly and tried to be helpful.  The concierge, Debbie, helped us book some tours and she was a delight.  Very helpful with lots of personality.  The Hotel could use a pool.  The fitness room was excellent.

We then proceeded to 3rd Floor. The room that we got was HUGE for all three of us! 0_0 I love the window part where you could sit and watch people & cars passed by. One thing though, I think our room was newly renovated cause of the smell. But it wasn't that strong.

It smelled much better than when we first open the room. \r\n\r\nAnyway, we enjoyed our stay in this hotel. Our room/bed was clean, there's coffee,creamers, & sugar. The bathroom has bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash (body wash was empty already but they have a bar soap too). So, it wasn't a big deal for me. We had our breakfast too in the hotel. Continental breakfast is about $14 and buffet is $21 something. I mistakenly grabbed some eggs and oatmeal but the waiter said it was okay I was just charged for the continental.

At the end of the day, it was convenience that makes this hotel worth the money. I think when they get their construction completed and housekeeping in order this place will get better ratings.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"G","userLocation":"Phoenix, AZ","reviewSubmissionTime":"2015-04-04T20:38:25Z","roomTypeId":200423078,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"hotelId":"476728","reviewId":"551f579de4b0ccf64345c6ab","photos":[],"itinId":"1100346454232","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"HMP MMD","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Mary","brandType":"Expedia","title":"More than adequate","reviewText":"This hotel is conveniently located with very polite and helpful staff.

Valet parking right out front of the hotel was quick and courteous (although like everywhere in SF, not cheap). Grea\r\n\r\nWe checked-in around 3 in the afternoon on a Saturday and reception was not busy at all.  Reception staff were attentive and friendly and within minutes we were on our way up to our room. Our room was on the first floor.  The room itself was more than adequately large, clean and well maintained.  Nice to see actual tea and coffee service in the room instead of just one bag of nasty drip coffee. Only downside to our room was that it was right next to the courtyard. There are shutter blinds on the windows to provide adequate privacy though. Luckily for us though, no-one was in the courtyard so we could open up the windows since it was such a pleasant day outside.\r\n\r\nThere was a four-piece Jazz band playing downstairs that evening from 7 p.m. (no cover charge) so before heading out for our 9 p.m. reservation we were able to stop by for a pre-dinner drink. Have to say the band was excellent! \r\n\r\nWe never used room service but all of the staff I passed in the halls were very friendly.\r\n\r\nNo hassle with check-out and the valet had our car out front in minutes after handing them check.

Close to the wharf was convenient. Parking price expensive!! $50 and the front desk attendent made no recommendations for more reasonable parking so we drove down the street and found 24 hr parking for $30.

Had to ask for more creamer for the coffee - not a problem, quick and courteous accommodation to that request. The room has a really nice, big flat screen, nice view of the city street through a canopy of trees. There's a great outdoor seating/courtyard area which would have been great to sit and sip cocktails if it hadn't been raining. The lobby area is all very modern and there's a wine bar, tv's, and lots of seating grouped in large and small areas. Best part is parking - although you pay $40 plus tax to park, it's good from checkin until 3pm on checkout day (checkout is at 11am). So, if you want to linger and sightsee you still have several hours of parking left at this hotel to do so.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"Everything!","negativeRemarks":"Can't think of anything.","locationRemarks":"Fisherman's Wharf, Little Italy, Ghirardelli's a few blocks down, Pier 39, Chinatown and downtown within walking or trolley distance, bay cruises.","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Sacramento, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2014-03-03T19:18:01Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Angela","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"hotelId":"476728","reviewId":"66962851","photos":[],"itinId":"168348584010","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[{"isFlaggable":false,"userNickname":"","displayLocale":"","date":"2014-03-07T19:30:11Z","id":"","response":"Thank you for the awesome review!

Lots to see within walking distance, on good bus routes to every direction, and close to two cable car terminals. Front desk staff very helpful, and our room was immaculately clean for most of our stay. However, we stayed a week, and our room cleaner's days off were noticeable. On those days the bed was not well made, and the bathroom was not cleaned properly (towels not changed, soggy washcloth left in a heap on side of tub).Suggest housekeeping supervisors watch their casuals more closely. But the lady who cleaned our room for most of our stay did an excellent job. Our room was very nice and the beds were comfortable. But the walls are thin. We could hear the alarm clock in the room next door (via the adjoining door), and whoever was upstairs thumped back and cross the floor for much of the night. We also got a fair bit of traffic noise through the window (suggest ask for a room overlooking the courtyard to avoid this). They offer a buffet breakfast for around $24, but we ate breakfast elsewhere for a lot less. There is an IHOP within walking distance that we thought was very good.

The room was clean, the neighborhood quiet and facilities were all functional albeit with a sober, non-luxurious appearance, which I am totally fine with. Being two blocks away from the Fisherman's Wharf made this hotel very convenient for my running workouts and for finding great seafood places nearby. The one only thing that made this hotel (slightly) inconvenient was that it was somewhat less accessible from BART stations, which is what I typically use to get from the San Francisco airport to whatever place I am staying at. This can be easily worked around by using the bus. Finally, the concierge at the hotel was very, very friendly and gave us all kinds of tips on how to make the most out of our trip and also helped us find a trustable cab to the airport. I greatly recommend staying at the Pier 2620 Fisherman's Wharf hotel.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Boca Raton, FL","reviewSubmissionTime":"2014-02-16T01:04:15Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Crash","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"476728","reviewId":"66291981","photos":[],"itinId":"169013978374","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[{"isFlaggable":false,"userNickname":"JKnudsen","displayLocale":"en_US","date":"2014-08-23T08:21:10Z","id":"526199","response":"We are glad that our interior, bed linens, room and location all met your expectations.

I would definitely stay there again.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Lambertville, NJ","reviewSubmissionTime":"2004-11-18T18:48:53Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"476728","reviewId":"18319558","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Pamela","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great Location","reviewText":"Concierge was fantastic and staff good - really great location.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Portland Oregon","reviewSubmissionTime":"2004-11-18T05:12:14Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"476728","reviewId":"18319555","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Ronnie","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Hilton Fisherman's Wharf","reviewText":"Nice accommadations, nice staff, nice atmosphere,\nnice lay-out. You get the idea. Just don't go in expecting Hilton's most ultra-lavish resort.\n\nIn my opinion, the location is extremely handy. It's walking-distance close to many of the best attractions and public transportation. We didn't bother to rent a car, so the latter was quite important. If you are going to depend on public transportation like we did, be sure to bone up on the routes and access times on the 'net before you go. We didn't, and paid for the misque. We \"accidently\" made a lot longer walk than we really were prepared for.\n\nIf you are interested in the least in marine history, be sure to visit the marine museum and old boat display west of the main fisherman's wharf area.\n\nGoing to Alcatraz? Do yourself a favor and read Jim Quillen's book before you go. I think it's \"Alcatraz From the Inside\" subtitled \"A Life of Pain and Sorrow.\" I read it after my visit and realized that it would have really brought the alcatraz visit to life; and it's ly impressive enough going in dry and unprepared.\n\nTake care, and good luck.Ron E.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Memphis, TN.","reviewSubmissionTime":"2004-11-02T21:54:41Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"476728","reviewId":"18319557","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Norma","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Hilton Fisherman's Wharf","reviewText":"We had an excellent stay at this hotel.

The hotel itself was very clean and the staff was very helpful.  The concierge desk at the hotel was also very helpful in helping us plan our activities and had some great restaurant recommendations in the area.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Melbourne, FL","reviewSubmissionTime":"2004-11-01T18:01:14Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]}]}}}

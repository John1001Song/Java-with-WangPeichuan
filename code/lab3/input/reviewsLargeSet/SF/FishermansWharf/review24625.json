It was quiet, clean, and comfortable.  We called down to get extra towels and the brought us the of every size within 5 minutes.  The bed was comfortable and the pillows were the best (I wanted to buy 2). We did go green and got vouchers which we used the next morning to get some red bulls with ease.  We did not eat at the hotel but went to the wharf.  There is a Safeway and CVS less than 50 yards away if you want snacks.  The concierge service was great!  Very knowledgable and helped us out by printing out our tickets with ease when we forgotten them at home.

After driving for 5 hours, one usually wants to have an easy, uneventful check in to their hotel.   It took 20 minutes to eventually get our car parked after driving up to the hotel and another 15 minutes to get checked in and actually be in our room.  There was a long line of cars waiting to check in and absolutely no one directing traffic or taking control. There were two options for parking - $50 to park at the hotel or $35 to park in the garage across the street.  No one offered valet parking.\r\n\r\n2- The hotel was very noisy all during the night.  The rooms were not well insulated.  The people in the  room across from us had several kids and the parents yelled at them all night long.  The people in the room above us walked around in what sounded like combat boots; we're talking from 12:00 at night to the wee hours of the morning.  Also, our room faced the street, so there was a lot of noise early in the morning starting around 6:30 am.  The blinds did not shield out the morning light either.

Parking is challenging and expensive so this was a plus. I was unaware that we would be charged a fee for parking our car in the underground garage of the hotel so this was a surprise but still cheaper than street parking.  The room was very clean and pleasantly decorated. Beds were comfortable with ample pillows. Staff was friendly and helpful. Cons: The toilet flushed only when the handle was held down for some time.  It required the handle to be jiggled a minute or two later because it wouldn't stop running.  The sink filled with water very quickly and appeared to need the drain unclogged.  The heater/AC unit did not have any temperature control that functioned.  It blew air but we were unable to change the temperature.

There is a grocery store and mall right across the street that made it easy to grab any missing items from our trip.  Starbucks and IHOP are also very conveniently located, as well as picking up one of the cable cars.  Using our card to access the floors made us feel very safe.  Our room had a nice view to the hotel's pool.  The staff was very helpful and courteous to us.  I would definitely stay again.  However, the parking is very expensive - $50 a night - but cheaper than surrounding areas which charged an average of $5 per hour.  The food bar in the lobby was also a bit expensive i.e.,  $9 for a hot dog.  The server would not allow me (an adult) to buy the hot dog because it was on the child's menu.  Doesn't make sense to me.  Finally, after the first night I had to request that my bed be made as if we were new tenants.  Housekeeping did not spread the bed appropriately and there were still a lot of wrinkles and folds under the comforter.

I believe you can request one.\nThe walls are thin and I could hear my neighbors which is why I rated a 4 on room comfort.\nOur room was right next to the city bus parking lot--not cool. I could hear the buses backing in, etc. But we solved that issue by turning on the air conditioner all night long.\nI rated a 4 on staff because we went to the bar to have a drink and the bartender did not know what he was doing.\nEverything is pretty close. We walked everywhere. China Town is a mile away and Union Square not too much further. Otherwise you might want to figure out the bus routes ahead of time or take cabs. Of course, Fisherman's Wharf is right there which is nice to just walk along the bay or take some tours like Alcatraz.

Instead, for the price of a taxi, he arranged for myself and my two adult kids to be taken to the venue in their Lincoln Town Car. On another day, we had left the room late in the morning. When we returned, in the early afternoon for a short time, we were in the beds for a short time resting before going out again. When we returned, our room had again been made up. That was very nice. The only concern I have about the hotel is that one switch operates both lights in the sink area and in the shower area. There is no door to close between those areas and the sleeping areas, so a person who wants to get up early to shower and get ready for the day cannot prevent the light from disturbing those who are still sleeping.

He also ran downstairs and got us our new keys so kudos to him being proactive to make sure we were happy.\n\nThe room was clean, as expected, but I realized then we didn't have a fridge or microwave. After reading closely into the initial terms, there it was, fee for additional fridge or microwave. So that was disappointing but my fault for not reading so I won't hold that against them.\n\nWe went to the concierge on day 2 for dinner suggestions. He was very animated and helpful and directed us to Tarantinos because my friend wanted to have a lobster roll. He said \"oh that sounds great. Tarantinos can whip you up an awesome one you should go there.\". We go, sit down, and realize they do not serve lobster rolls... At all. So we ended up just getting drinks, appetizers, and changing locale completely.

Phone in the room was not working. It made calls but the person on the other end could not hear me. The way rooms are on the 4th floor, if you leave the blinds open, everyone passing in the hallway can see inside your room. If you shut them, it's completely dark since that's the only window in the room. I think the same issue exists on the 3rd floor. I had a late check-out but they checked me out of the room without me leaving so once I came back to the hotel after lunch, my keys were not working. I had to go back down and they had to check me in again. Just a horrible experience. Lobby is clean and modern-looking but the fire pit area is on the side of the valet car service so as you sit there, you get all the car fumes. Concierge is not helpful.

Few points that others pointed out:\n\n- Parking is $45+tax but it's valet with in and out privileges. The may seem steep but it's one less thing to worry about your car being out on the streets, having to find parking, period, in SF which is a nuisance, and other garages don't allow in and out privileges. The garage is right below the Sheraton with 24 hour valet. We found this very worth it.\n\n- The hotel just underwent a $33 million renovation. Our bed was the most comfortable bed we've slept in (and we travel a lot) with a cozy comforter and four pillows. The room was clean and had cute summery decor, as well as the halls. It's a very vibrant hotel on the inside.\n\n-Downstairs in the lobby is a huge 'iPad' that you can use to find nearby eateries, tourist attractions etc accompanied with reviews and star ratings. This was very convenient. Try breakfast at The Hollywood Cafe -- good portions at a good price.\n\n- The only reason why I gave the hotel 4 stars for hotel upkeep is because our balcony was a bit run down and dirty BUT.. Who really is going to spend time on the balcony when you've got the pier..\n\n-I would recommend doing the double decker red bus tour that is $38. It has on and off privileges and 28 stops around the city at the tourist spots: Golden Gate bridge, Art museum, six painted ladies etc. The ticket is good for 24 hours from purchase and offers a great tour + transportation around.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"Loved the bed, the decor and staff.","negativeRemarks":"Balcony was a bit run down but who really is going to spend time on the balcony when you've got the pier but mentioned in case someone is interested.","locationRemarks":"You are within walking distance of the most beautiful parts of SF - the Pier and great wharf restaurants.

The carpet is worn, the walls are scuffed, the rooms are dated, the window coverings were dirty, etc. I am NOT usually a picky person (and this is the first review I've ever written), but I felt compelled to let others know that the pics are misleading - this hotel is not as nice as it looks. Also, the coffee bar (which becomes a regular bar in the evening) is staffed by less-than-friendly employees both day and night. Downright rude, actually. I should say, however, that the front desk folks and concierge were friendly and helpful. In all fairness, I should also note that the beds were super comfy.

Some travellers have complained about the noise. We were worried beforehand but after staying there, we didn't find the rooms to be all that excessively noisy. I think it depends on the other guests around your room whether or not one experiences extreme noise. The beds were plush and comfortable. About the only drawback in terms of noise (and reason I gave all 4s instead of 5s#, is housekeeping starts cleaning each and every day between 8 and 9AM weekdays and weekends, rain or shine, regardless. Maids can be unintentionally noisy even with the do not disturb sign on the door. The room walls and doors are thin in those regards, so you have to watch tv very quietly in the rooms. And they can be a bit stingy about providing extra wash linens. Otherwise, this place is a charm. We intend to go back there upon our next San Francisco trip. Tip: There's a small mall with a Safeway grocery store #drinking water, snacks, fruits, beer and liquor#, Walgreens #travel size toiletries, drinking water, SF souveniers#, Bay Cleaners for same, next day or 2 day service #also has internet access for 30 cents per min), and Shipping store for USPS, UPS, etc. This tiny mall can be entered from the pay parking lot and is located directly across the street behind this Sheraton.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"Clean.

There was an exceptional woman working at the concierge desk: Stephanie.

I told her we would leave it with her to give away, but she offered to mail it to us when the mail center opened.

But when I arrived at check in which was 2PM I was told that due to them being \"over booked\" the night before it was going to be another hour and a half before they could let me check in, and they were spectacle about that. When I was able to check in I was told about the $44 daily parking fee. I'm glad they told me upfront but was not happy that I had to pay for parking, especially on a daily basis and for so much. For the amount I was paying for my room I would hope I was only charged one fee for the duration of my stay, or even not at all. When I arrived to my room I was not impressed. When I think Sheraton I think luxury and class, and I got mediocre. The air conditioning was old and rundown, the beds were uncomfortable and the size was a full not a king like I requested, the toilet didn’t flush right, and like most hotels they charged for internet ($14.99 a night) but offered it free in the lobby which was always cluttered. Lastly, when you self park and attempt to exit the parking lot it’s a hassle to get out. I figured I'm paying $44 a day to park you can at least make it easy to access the lot and even easier to exit. It took me literally 8 minutes to get the parking staff to let me out, and when on the intercom they were very rude. Overall I have to say I was disappointed and seriously considering staying somewhere else if I chose to go back to San Francisco.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Burbank, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-05-10T04:28:06Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"24625","reviewId":"18342174","photos":[],"itinId":"346291050","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":1,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Lee","brandType":"Expedia","title":"DO NOT STAY HERE VERY POOR HOTEL AND POOR MANAGEMENT!!","reviewText":"DO NOT STAY HERE VERY POOR HOTEL!!!\nHorrible Staff and Management and the rooms are small and dirty!!!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":1,"ratingHotelCondition":1,"ratingService":1,"ratingRoomComfort":1,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Australia, Melbourne","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-05-09T02:33:55Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"24625","reviewId":"18341975","photos":[],"itinId":"366457053","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Jay","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Overall great!","reviewText":"Great place...felt new and clean.

About 9PM we realized there was no way to leave a night light on in the bathroom so one of us went to the front desk and asked for a plug-in night light. After several inquiries, they decided none existed and suggested we go across the street and buy one at Safeway. By 10PM we figured out the air conditioner was making the room feel like a sauna.

Therefore, one of the the reasons I chose the Sheraton at Fisherman's Wharf was because of the location -- only 2 blocks from the wharf. I also read it was recently renovated so I thought it had to be clean. Well, during our stay all I kept saying to my husband was this was an excellent choice, I couldn't have selected anything more satisfactory. Keep in mind I did consider higher end hotels in the area, but am so glad I did not stay in any of them. First of all it was truly immaculate (immensely important to me), and secondly it was centrally located. It was within steps of everything we wanted to do. Also, the hotel choice colors (soft blues, aquas and yellows) and flow of the main hallways and room was so soothing. Coming back to our room after a long day of touring was a reward in iself. I like staying at hotels that are nicer than my own living accomodations and this was it! The conceirge was always most helpful, staff always friendly and ready with a smile. The location was absolutely perfect. We were able to walk to the tour bus in the a.m. and be the first on line, didn't have to wait for a shuttle to pick us up to get us there. I would no doubt recommend this hotel to anyone for business or pleasure. Also, I would definitely return if I were again visiting the San Francisco Bay area and not bother to look for a different experience.

My biggest issue with this hotel is the NOISE. I would HIGHLY recommend that if you book this hotel, insist on not staying on the first floor. We were located in a room at the beginning of a hallway, where everyone had to pass thru to get to their rooms....we could honestly hear everyone's conversations word for word. Further, our window looked right out to a main street, where many cars, buses, and people passed by. The noise from the hall combined with the noise from outside made it impossible to get a good nights sleep for our 4 nights there. In hindsight, we should have asked to move, which is super inconvenient but probably would have been worth it. Not too much else to say about the hotel other than that. The price was right, and it did the trick. The staff were friendly enough, but didn't really go out of their way to make you feel welcome.

The grounds and rooms looked like they were recently updated to look more modern. I stayed on the 4th floor (top level). There was a couch in it and a slanted window. If it werent for the rain, I wouldve had a great view of the hill. The bed was king-sized and very comfy. There was also a flat screen TV. What I enjoyed most is the location. It is not on the Wharf, but a mere two blocks away. Its a quick walk, and despite the rain, it was still very convenient to jaunt around the area. Its right across the street from a Safeway so if you forget any toiletries or need a cheap snack, just go there. What I didt like about the hotel were the costs of parking, room internet and room service. But I suppose thats to be expected. Parking came out to $49/night after taxes. My understanding is that this is a pretty general rate for any of the hotels in the Wharf area. Wifi for my room cost $15 per 24 hours. I saw people using their laptops in the lobby area so perhaps Wifi is free in the lobby? If so, then I guess Im the fool. :) As for room service, I ordered an ice cream sundae listed as about $10 on the menu, but after the \"service charge\" or bringing the food to your room, it came out to about $17. Much more than the exorbitant sundae I had a Ghirardelli and not as good.

The first night we got there they explained to us that they did not have any king rooms available, so that was a little disappointing. He explained to us that you are only guaranteed a room, not necessarily the room you \"Requested\". (same with all hotels when booking through a 3rd party) But the man that checked us in was extremely helpful and he said we will have some king rooms available the next day to make sure all of our items were packed up and come back in the am. We went down nice and early to ensure we got a king room when it became available. We went off for the day and when we came back not only did he get us a king room, he got us a king room with one of the few balconies in the hotel and he had all of our stuff moved to the new room so we didn't have to do anything, which was great! The hotel is in a good location, because it is close to the touristy areas, but you could also hop public trans. (right outside the hotel) pretty much anywhere you want to go. It is within walking distance to the Alcatraz tours, Pier 39, Ghiradelli Sq, & the cable cars. Our flight wasnt until 11pm and we didnt have a hotel for that day, so the bellman held our luggage for the day so we could get the most out of our trip. The fire pits outside/lounge area came in handy, when we had no where to go while waiting for our shuttle. Overall we had a fantastic trip and really enjoyed the hotel and all the great staff that they have there.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Boston, Ma","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-10-23T02:28:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"24625","reviewId":"18342792","photos":[],"itinId":"250180973","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Dave","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Nice","reviewText":"Great little hotel in a great location.

I was wrong because at this hotel they are trying to make easy money on their parking. I arrived at the hotel late at night and parked on the hotel premises. I was shocked in the morning when they told me the hign cost of the parking fees. Maybe that is why I received a small discount on my room to subsidized my high parking fee. I became even more disappointed with the hotel when all I did was park outside the Hotel and my fee was free. Is this hotel trying to make a profit on their parking? Is it because they are not making a profit on their rooms. Well, it doesn't matter I would not recommend this hotel to anybody because of this incident.

Needless to say we immediately got a room change. We stayed here 4 years ago and really like the reception area with large couches and chairs and a big fire at the top. This has now been replaced with small tables and chairs, plastic coated, with a bar now at the top. Needless to say the prices are way over the top. Outside they have small seating areas with hot coals, when they work. Didn't like the maid casually advising me she would \"be off now for 2 days and won't see you again\" meaning can I have my tip.

However, there are probably better places to stay than the Sheraton. First the plus points: The hotel is clean and smart in appearance and the rooms whilst not big are adequate and comparatively well equipped. The cleaners do a good job and are honest; I accidentally left our safe open one day with my laptop, passports and $1500 on show, all still there when we returned at the end of the day. Now for the negatives: For three people they provided just two sugars and two creams per day. More were available on request, but you had to ask everyday. The room was noisy at night as our room overlooked the 'fire pits' outside the bar; earplugs are a must if you want to get to sleep. Speaking of the 'fire pits', they were continually blown out by the wind and requests to relight them were often ignored by the staff. BTW San Francisco is cold at night, even in July. So, if you're a smoker, you'll find it chilly drinking outside without a working 'fire pit'. If you're brave you can light them yourself, but you'll loose all the hair on your arm and you have to sit with your foot on the gas valve to prevent it being blown out. As for the bar, the drinks were expensive and I never saw the barman smile once in two weeks. There is no restaurant to speak of, although you can order bar snacks. For breakfast I recommend ihop over the road.

For a room that was supposed to sleep 4 adults, there were only 3 small drawers in the armoire for clothes plus it doubled as a closet so we ended up storing the luggage underneath the bathroom vanity. The bathroom was so small you have to squeeze in and out to use it. This room may be okay for a couple but NOT for families. And definately not for 4 adults! You will feel very cramped and caged in by the end of the first day. There was no A/C, only a cheap motel window fan that was loud and did not cool the room down at all. We had to open the windows. After one night, we requested a larger room or a suite. The frontdesk referred us to the hotel manager who never called back. When we were leaving we asked for a Bell Hop to assist us and after waiting 20 minutes we ended up dragging our stuff down and through the lobby (the bell hops were just standing there doing nothing!).

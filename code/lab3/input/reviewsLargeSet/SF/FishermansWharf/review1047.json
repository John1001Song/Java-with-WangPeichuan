They did provide ear plugs which are definitely needed.  When we arrived there was tape holding up the soap shelf in the bathtub.

It stayed up the entire trip.  \r\n\r\nI called room service and the front desk several times upon our arrival to sit on the other end of a ringing telephone.  All I wanted was to have a corkscrew sent up to our room.  I ended up having to call the front desk from my cellphone at the number in the listing.  I was then told that I was actually staying in the Express side of the hotel so that I would have to call their front desk.  I was transferred back to the same front desk that I had been trying to get a hold of and they finally answered on the transfer.  If I'm staying in a separate hotel then I should have been notified as we would have changed our arrangements.  Also, needless to say, we did not end up ordering room service due to this.\r\n\r\nOverall, I was disappointed with this hotel.

I would recommend calling 311 to see if alternate side parking is suspended. Otherwise street parking MAY be hard to find but on a rainy day, there will be plenty.

The curbside unloading is a joke next to the building and the tiny garage for 20 minute check-in (mind you ALL the spots are marked that) is very frustrating to get into.For the price you pay it would be nice to have a complimentary breakfast, but no such luck. The continental breakfast they offer is an additional $18 per person. We recommend going to Anderson's bakery right next to the hotel. Great prices and great food. For 2 of us it was around $13 for everything. Do not go to the Denny's. It is \"tourist priced\" meaning that everything on the menu is doubled in price due to the location. The room was fabulous (we got a towel animal on the bed) as well as the lobby and hall ways. The front desk staff was nice and professional and helped us find a better way back to the freeway.

If these rooms were considered newly renovated I would hate to see the other rooms. It was obvious I had alot of luggage with me. I was there for a race and had a huge awkward case with my disassembled bike in it, another large roller suitcase and a equally large knapsack. The weight of my luggage was the equivalent of me. I am a middle aged though fit woman. One would have expected given I had to travel a block that I would have been offered assistance. I wasn't. In fact as I was struggling with my gear to the hotel a local young man kindly offered to help me to the hotel. Unfortunatley there were two more holiday inns back to back and I went to the wrong one as the directions weren't clear. Again I was assisted by hotel guests (not staff) when we finally figured out I was in the wrong hotel. One of the guests inquired for me and we were pointed to the other holiday inn. Again no assistance was offered as I trudged outdoors. As I made my way to the other hotel, two more hotel guests took my larger piece of luggage from me (all of assistance done without my asking yet never by a hotel employee) and helped me into the lobby.

Nothing wrong with that, but if you take the stairs up, you cannot open the door to your floor. Really makes no sense other than keeping unwanted people off the floors. Either way, dumb idea.\n\nOur first night there we were awaken by a fire alarm at 12:30AM. It had rained so it was really cold. I have a 6 year old so I took the comforter off my bed to keep her warm while we waited for the firemen to turn the fire alarm off. Apparently someone thought it would be funny to set the alarm off. We didn't find it funny at all!!\n\nThere is a lack of personnel at that building. The front desk was closed most of the time we stayed there. We were headed out to dinner and needed a taxi. No one around. Had to use the house phone to call someone at the other building. Taxi didn't get there for about 20-30 minutes. They also tried to sell me a town car ride instead of a taxi to the dinner place which they said was cheaper.

The hotel is divided into two separate buildings and we were in the one across the street from the main lobby and pool, but it didn't bother us. There is a Denny's right inside the building we were in, made breakfasts very convenient. We had a little difficulty with the nighttime staff on the first night-- I called and asked for a roll-away bed and it took nearly 3 hours for them to deliver it to the room, so my 10-year-old stayed up til midnight waiting for his bed. I had to call multiple times and no one could give me an update on when the bed would be arriving. I was pretty sure after that that I would be writing a bad review. But then over the next few days the rest of the staff was great, the place was clean, quiet, comfortable and we had a wonderful time there. So I decided the problem the first night was an anomaly.

Families with children will enjoy the pool, fitness center is very small though and there's no whirlpool or hot tub. Not much bang for you buck. We've stayed at far more superior hotels at more reasonable rates. We purchased our room with breakfast included but was sadly mistaken when we arrived as we received only 2 buffet vouchers/day/adult & children were only free if they ordered from the limited kids menu a choice of 4 items of pancakes & bacon, cereal with a banana, yogurt & fruit or oatmeal. The 2 out of 3 days we were there we ordered the buffet for our kids (10 & 13 yrs) for an additional cost so they could get a better variety of food. We were there with another family of 4 & when asked to sit separately they accused us of not wanting to pay a tip. We always paid a tip even though the servers only brought coffee, removed plates & one time brought our kids hot chocolate the day we ordered the buffet for them. Funny as the breakfast voucher had \"gratuity included\" printed at the bottom. Hotel staff at front desk were very friendly and helpful but restauant staff not so good.

The second drawback is most definitely within the hotel's control. The attitude and demeanor of the wait staff in the restaurant and lounge area at night left a lot to be desired. Most of the employees seemed indifferent at best, and some even seemed taken aback that a customer wanted service. On a similar note, it definitely seems that the front desk is under staffed a lot of the time. I attempted to call the fromnt desk from my room a couple times, but no one would pick up.

The advertised \"free' buffet didnot include the kids - they had to eat off of a very limited menu for it to be free. Finally the laundry only opens at 8.30am so for those of us that wanted to see the sights you had to forgo them so you could have clean clothes. The laundry shut and was locked at 10.30pm - even though it was in the underground basement. Didn't matter though there was only 3 washers and three dryers to go around anyway!! None of the Conceirges were really interested in helping us to busy reading the new on their laptops.

We stayed at the Beach street building, not the main building. Denny's was in the lobby of our hotel, convenient for coffee in the morning.\n\nThe room was fine, the beds were very comfortable and pillows too. The maids did a very basic cleanup daily but could've done a little better. It would've been nice to have a small fridge in the room for bottled water and the wine you may pick up on a Sonoma wine tour.\n\nThe location is great if you're planning on taking tour busses through gray line tours because they pick up at the piers there on Fisherman's Warf. The F line is right outside the hotel for convenient street car rides to ans from several areas of San Fran. We also took the city bus which was easy to figure out.\n\nThe one complaint I had was at the end of our trip the front desk clerk told us to take a taxi to the airport becase it was faster and she said it would cost $45.00. It ended up costing $65.00 and the driver was nuts. I would definately suggest taking the Airport Express shuttle service. Its only $17.00 per person.

We stayed at a total of 4 different Holiday Inn hotels on the trip and this one was by far the worst.\n\nAfter driving in from Big Sur that day (over 4 hours) we checked into our room only to find someone elses luggage in the room. The other fun part was that there were two double beds in the room as well, even when we mentioned that this was our honeymoon. After trekking back to the lobby through the danky halls which reminded us of an aging hospital corridor, we were given a new room.\n\nYes we were happy to find a king bed, but no, we were not happy to find nasty hair, only 1 outlet, dingy lighting, and furniture that was broken/haphazardly arranged. The stay was barely okay.\n\nTo top it all off, we were quite disturbed by the hotel staff's response when a lady fainted in line while we were checking in. They did not call the paramedics, but instead insisted that she make the decision, even though she was extremely worried and completely disoriented.\n\nThere are far better hotels to stay at in San Francisco, the other ones we visited were in Union Square and the Holiday Inn Express in the Civic Center.\n\nRetuning?

Check in time wasn't until 3, so they let us keep our bags there until our room was ready, which was nice. They also let us keep it there after we checked out, since our flight wasn't until later in the evening. Now, if you're expecting a 5-star hotel experience, don't come here! It's really for people not spending much time in their room. Very spacioius, nice king bed, nothing special. Although we were on the priority floor. All is good except for one thing. On our first night's stay we were laying down in our bed, and noticed some red spots on our sheets. (Gross, it looked like blood) We went down to the front desk and asked them to change the sheets. They said: \"Is it alright if I leave them on the bed, and you can make the bed?\" What was i supposed to say? No!? I said sure. There was no apology. AND they brought the wrong sheets. The next morning we decided to make it obvious that the wrong sheets were on the bed, and room service would notice and change them. Sure enough, they did.

There are 4 ways to return to this hotel using the Muni 30 or 47 bus which will pretty much drop you off at the door or the last stop of the F line streetcar in front of the Walgreens and it's a 4 min walk or the Powell & Hyde cable car last stop about 10 min walk.\nThe walgreens around the corner a definite plus easy access to decently priced Bottled water, fresh juice and pretty much anything you'll need. The staff kept the room clean everyday and when we asked for more toiletries we were given a ton of stuff enough for 4 people everyday and fresh towels to boot. The 24hr Denny's downstairs is a nice place for the late evening munchies since most restaurants close or stop serving food by 22:00. Safety in this hotel was great we were away from the homeless people and it was quiet at night.\nI would totally recommend this hotel to friends and Family and the fact that the Boudin Bakery (open at 8am) is just minutes away to enjoy your 1st and defintely not last clam chowder bread bowl a major bonus!

However, we were given a very large room in the Beach/annex building as soon as we arrived from the Airport. I was very impressed with the size of the room and we rested before heading out after an early flight in. The room was very spacious and the bathroom was large and clean. There are computers with working printers on each floor so it made it very convenient to print out boarding passes, check out weather, and research on activities around the area. We did not rent a car since public transportation is readily available. There are a couple of bus stops near the hotel and we made use of that to go to various places in the city. The only thing I wish they would look into is the service of their front desk staffs. They were almost non-existent at the beach/annex hotel and when they are there, they were not very customer-oriented.

One side of the valance over the window was hanging down a bit - the carpets were oldish and the room had a shabby look. The thing I really disliked was the bed. We had a king, and the blanketing arrangement was several layers of sheets and light blankets, covered by a heavy, coarse bed spread, all wrapped and tucked in so tightly, it was impossible to get in without dismanting the whole thing and then sheets and blankets got all displaced. I really loathed the bed, and I normally can sleep anywhere and don't mind at all. The check in was slow. The layout of the hotel, with the different buildings was awkward. The housekeeping people were excellent. The girl at the desk in our building was really great as well. The location, at Fisherman's wharf and near to the various transit lines, was wonderful.

The rooms were clean and comfortable.

We felt the rooms were overpriced but I suppose that's to be expected during spring break in San Francisco.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"San Jose, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-03-19T16:16:36Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]}]}}}

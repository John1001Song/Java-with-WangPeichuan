This is the first time I have chosen this specific hotel.\r\nThe reason I did so, was that I was saving a \"few bucks\".  Because it's for business, I try to keep our companies costs down when booking.\r\nWhen I got to the hotel and pulled in to park.  I was greeted by a very friendly attendant.  That was wonderful.\r\nThen he told me it's $50 a night to park!!!  I have never had such an inflated rate and have stayed much closer to the wharf, actually right on it, in the past for less.  With the ourtrageous parking, I actually cost my company more money than had I stayed at another location.\r\nI attempted to negotiate at the desk and was told that housing and property is worth more in San Francisco, so it is what it is and they couldn't reduce it.\r\nMy room was facing a noisey back street with the cable line running directly next to the window.

This was I think the easiest and most convenient of all of them. On-site parking was a breeze, no waiting out on the street for a valet since they have enough room for many cars to park at check-in and our car was retrieved easily when needed. We checked in at 7pm which meant that we had parking covered for 24 hours even after checking out of the hotel. Staff was all friendly and very pro-active in meeting our needs. Cable car and bus stops & the wharf were very short walks & would be easy for an elderly relative to access. Street noise was a minimum and the fitness facility the best I've seen for this size hotel. Would totally stay here again. Only improvements would be to add the Omni's warm cookies & milk at bedtime and to include a complimentary breakfast to make it perfect!

Desk, porter and hotel staff are the typical fine Marriott Standard. Rooms are good size (suggest in inside room-outside rooms can be noisy due to traffic and bus stops) Now the less than good - The beds are awful! We refused a room due to the failed mattress, and they gave us another, that was just as bad. When I went to the desk, they offered a bed board which make the bed only tolerable. My back was aching for a quality night sleep. There was a fire alarm in the hotel one evening, and the porter staff went around to assure everyone to ignore it. We did not, and waited outside for the fire trucks to leave. I wonder why Marriott daily charges for internet are what I pay for a month at home. At very secluded motor inns in Northern Nova Scotia last year, they all had free internet.

The hotel staff was very polite and friendly and provided us with a very helpful map upon arrival that we used frequently during our stay. The hotel is about 2 blocks from the Hyde Street cable car stop, which we used frequently along with a number of bus lines that will get you to the west part of San Francisco. There is a Trader Joe's grocery store a couple of blocks away, which we used to stock up snacks in our room and 2 Walgreen's drug stores just a couple of blocks in either direction for other supplies. Also, there is a Starbucks very close to the hotel near another major cable car stop and also in the hotel/lobby restaurant area, but we did not use this one during our stay.

The Marriott is in a great location; easy walk to Wharf, North Beach, China Town . . . if you don't care to walk, buy the City Pass and you can ride the cable cars free and use the MUNI bus system; pass also comes with other freebies. The hotel staff was more than friendly; we didn't use the concierge much, but when we did they were super helpful. I recommend doing so especially if you don't know the area. Even if you do, they have good inside info. Everytime we walked by they were helping people and seemed to be very patient and above & beyond in their service. Property is a bit worn but still very nice and super clean (at least what we experienced). The room comes with a fridge which was a big plus, and I think you can ask for a microwave. Blow dryer is in the room and it's not one of those awkward ones attached to the wall - it's a full size sitting in a bag on the vanity. One issue; they advertise the \"Revive\" bed, but it is a normal king bed with a feather top . . . had trouble most every night with the fitted sheet popping off the corners exposing the topper and you could feel feathers through the sheets. Not a huge deal, and when things stayed together, the bed was more comfortable than many I've stayed in.

The location was ideal-close to Fishermans Wharf to be able to rent bikes and walk around conveniently and easy walking up Columbus Avenue to Little Italy and good dining choices, and close enough to taxis, trams and the train to get to downtown. Two years ago in September, we stayed at a hotel on Nob Hill and while the bar at the top has a spectacular view, there was more uphill walking which is ok to a point. We prefer the location of the Marriot as a base as we are quite active and love SF for its biking and running.

They certainly missed their mark. The room service menu was basic causing me to want to seek a restaurant in town. The breakfast (sausage) came uncooked. The rooms were very small and came with two full size beds not the usual queen size. Between the sheets and the mattress they put a feather or goose down type insert that had me checking out with a sore back. If it's not part of the bed then don't improvise. Better yet, if you're trying to give it a pillow-top feel then just buy that type of bed. Lastly, I took a cab down to Pier 33 and was dropped off. When I had finished my sightseeing tours I waited patiently for a cab to drive by to take me back to my hotel. They were all occupied and I got tired of waiting in the hot sun after about 30 minutes. I telephoned the hotel to see if the could call one for me to pick me up at Pier 33. They instead gave me walking directions back to the hotel.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Seattle","reviewSubmissionTime":"2006-11-01T13:25:29Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"20488","reviewId":"18549798","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Scot","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Nice, didn't spend much time there","reviewText":"Not bad","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Utah","reviewSubmissionTime":"2006-10-12T00:21:18Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"20488","reviewId":"18549797","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Henry","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Enjoyed the Brief Stay","reviewText":"Overall satisfaction is important and expected.

It's a Marriott...","reviewText":"First of all, don't expect a \"San Francisco\" ambiance here. Inside the hotel, you won't have a clue what city you are located in...it's a Marriott hotel. Very nice, large room. We arrived at 1AM local time and the overnight staff was a bit brief. However, the people during the day were great. The front desk and concierge were very pleasant and helpful. It was an easy walk to the wharf and other locations. Next time we may stay closer to Union Square just to make it an easier walk to nerby locations.\n\nProbably the only complaint would be the restaurant. It's a bit pricy and limited in menu. Breakfast buffet is good. We ate dinner there once (a lot of rain and we had just returned from an 11 hour tour). Virtually no one there. Good news is that there are *TONS* of good restaurants within 5 minutes of the hotel. If you want to be in Fisherman's Wharf, it's a good choice...","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Poughkeepsie, New York","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-01-13T08:48:47Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"20488","reviewId":"18549728","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Georgia","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Marriot Fisherman's Whart","reviewText":"This hotel was lovely.

Also, watch out for Tuesday and Thursday nights, when the streets get cleaned at around 2am so overnight parking on the street is not allowed.

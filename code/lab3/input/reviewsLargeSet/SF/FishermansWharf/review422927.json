This Courtyard has large rooms (for San Francisco anyway, not for Courtyards) with 5 pillows/bed and 3 sheets - VERY nice. The QUEEN beds were great. Great location - 3 blocks from Pier 39 and only about 12 from Chinatown/little Italy. But, as a nit, the bathroom was well below Courtyard standards. The towels were threadbare and small and we only got 1 tiny shampoo bottle for 4 of us (and no lotion, conditioner, or showercaps). Sure, we could've hunted down the staff and gotten more, but we've never had to do that before in a Courtyard. But, overall, it's a nice motel in a great area. The staff is quite nice and helpful. The lobby, while modest is fine (as if anyone really cares about the lobby anyway).","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"San Diego, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2006-04-19T16:45:55Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"422927","reviewId":"17862314","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Eric","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Nice Hotel","reviewText":"I would certainly go back","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"New York","reviewSubmissionTime":"2006-04-05T08:30:56Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"422927","reviewId":"17862313","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Dean","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Good value on the Wharf","reviewText":"The good news is that you're close to Fisherman's Wharf, and you can easily walk to a number of the tourist sites and restaurants. The bad news is that you're close to Fisherman's Wharf, and if your room is close to the street or sidewalk, then you are bound to hear people heading home from a night on the town. Basically it's a better bet for someone on vacation than on business. The staff was friendly and helpful, and it seemed to be a pretty good value for a good location.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Long Beach","reviewSubmissionTime":"2006-03-15T04:56:54Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"422927","reviewId":"17862275","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Cheryl","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Best mid-priced hotel.","reviewText":"This is not a four diamond hotel, but it is clean, quiet, comfortable, has all the little things you need (refrigerator - upon request; iron and ironing board in room, pay movies, small gym, honor bar in lobby and laundry facilities).

There is a security guard in the lobby at night, he also walks around the front and to the garage right next door, quite convienant.

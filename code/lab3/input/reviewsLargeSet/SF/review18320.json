We were surprised and grateful to experience how quiet our room was. No hallway noise or noise between rooms.\r\nThe only issue we had was with the area rug in the main room area.

","reviewText":"The hotel prides itself as being a tech hotel yet during my two night stay I had to have their electrician come to my room twice to either replace one of the tech amenities or jimmy rig it a certain way which required additional cables that they installed for me to use my tv. On top of that they had the audacity to charge me $200 to use the cables that they gave me to use their broken services. After going back and forth with them for the past two days I call for a late check out since I need to work an additional hour andthey tell me, sorry too many people have called and we are no longer accommodating late check outs since we have a high turn around rate for new guests coming in. I asked for the manager and gave him an ear full of their customer services issues which realistically is what we are paying for first and foremost! I want a nice bed and great customer service! If you are a 4 star hotel and you tell your guests that you cannot accommodate them for an additional hour you are basically telling us that this hotel isn't equipped to handle it's job! You Are a 4 star hotel in the peak season of San Francisco this is what you guys should do best. Customer service is always first when that's what we are purchasing in the first place. 3 star hotels have great beds as well minus the service. I have stayed in many amazing hotels and this was by far the most challenging hotel I've stayed in yet.

If you don't know who he is you've gotta check him out on YouTube!!). The hotel staff was SO nice! Valet overnight parking was $50, but that's the going rate at all the hotels in that area. Plus The Warfield was only a 5 minute walk from The Zetta so it was definitely worth it! The bed was super comfy & the room had a huge flat screen TV & a speaker system set up for your iPhone! The Zetta also offers FREE wi-fi unlike a lot of the other hotels in the Market/SOMA district which charge $15/night! The minibar was stocked with a large variety of beers, liquor, wine, juices, sodas, candies & snacks & the in-room espresso maker was awesome! I made late night (10:30pm!) dinner reservations online for The Cavalier (the hotels restaurant/bar) and even though the place was a little busy, the moment we walked in without asking any questions the hostess said, \"You must be Ashley...right this way...\"! She led us to a great corner table where we enjoyed complementary champagne (complements of the hotel) & the BEST ribeye steak I've ever had! I would make the 1.5 hour drive just to eat that steak again! So please believe me when I say, if you're not too sure where to stay in San Francisco and you're going back and forth comparing hotels (like I did!), stop right now and book a room at The Zetta!

We were also able to walk to Valencia from here (~15 minutes) to enjoy trendy boutique shopping. We also walked to Chinatown, Crooked Street and then to the Fishermen's Wharf one day from here with no problems. The hop-on, hop-off buses are nearby at Union Square to check out all of San Fran tourist hotspots and it's also easy to get on the trollies or transit as well. All of the staff we interacted with were helpful, friendly, funny and accommodating from the check-in to the concierge. The room itself was great - two queens, modern, clean, bright with good espresso and nice big bathroom and full amenities. Another great thing was the restaurant, the Cavalier, which had some of the best food we had on the whole trip... and trust me... we like good food. Great cafe in the square across the street for the mornings as well. The hotel was also baby-friendly and never caught one inadvertent scowl or insincere comments about having a baby with us.

The check in process took a couple of minutes.\n\nHeading up to our room was interesting. The Hotel is a little bit of a maze, but the signs are very clear. The rooms are all grouped together by 4 in these little alcoves. Because of this odd design the rooms look inward toward each other and there are some very clear views of the rooms across from you. We had a room that was not facing the street side, so we don't know if those rooms have more private views.\n\nThe room itself is very modern and very clean, but a little small.

I was then told that there was only one room available on the 3rd floor and that's all they can do . He did mention that I should take a look at it then come back and upgrade my room to a bigger room on a higher floor. First of all this was a Wednesday night and the hotel was quiter then a library when we got there . Sooo up to the room I go just to look at a view of a brick wall 3 feet from my window . Now I'm starting to feel like I'm being suckered into upgrading my room to get to a higher floor I check online and there are all sorts of rooms available for that night . I feel like I was lied to because it was my wedding night and the front staff were looking for more money . No thanks hotel Zeta! I will vote with my money and go elsewhere.

It's within walking distance of lots of shopping, Union Square, the BART, and great restaurants. It was nice to be able to walk to our favorite places without having to figure out parking each time. We did have a car and used the valet parking daily, and that's partly why I say the location is great. It's easy to get to by car, don't have to worry about finding a parking spot, and don't have to deal with the congestion of Union Square hotels which can be difficult to reach by car if you're not familiar with the streets. The $50 a day valet/parking fee is standard for the area, but the fast, free Wi-Fi helps make up for that. (Most hotels in the area charge for the parking and for Wi-Fi).

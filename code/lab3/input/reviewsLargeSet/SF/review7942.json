Check in was easy, even though Expedia screwed up my name again, and it was a slight challenge to find my reservation. This is always a bit scary when the sign out front says \"NO VACANCY\". In the end they found our reservation and we got the \"non-smoking\" room we had booked. My wife swears that someone had been smoking in it, but for me the air freshener they used masked it OK. The room was large, but out-dated, even with a smallish flat screen TV. The sliding glass door in back shared a common balcony/walk overlooking the pool. The lock on that door seemed very flimsy and was hard to use. We only opened once and then turned on the AC and locked it as best we could.

The beds are very new and quite comfortable.  The room had a nice décor and we enjoyed how the slider opened to the peaceful courtyard.  The grounds are very well maintained. Breakfast had many options and was always monitored and refilled as needed. Every staff person we interacted with was pleasant and friendly.  We did ask for a room towards the back and weren't bothered by any freeway noise. It was very easy to find off the freeway and a less than 10 minute drive to countless restaurants. According to the check out hostess they have plans to upgrade the lobby, which was in good shape already, and the room bathrooms, which I agreed are due for an upgrade, but still quite useable and decent.

It is an older, 2-story layout surrounding a large pool and spa with a nice grassy area that is child-safe. The first floor rooms open out onto the grassy area, which is perfect for relaxing outside without going into the gated pool area (I read while my young daughter played with some other children). Each time we returned to the room, I propped open the front & sliding back doors to allow the breeze to flow through and that removed the common smell found in older hotels after just a couple minutes. There was a small refrigerator/freezer, microwave, coffee maker, hair dryer, t.v. and free in-room wi-fi connection, everything I needed to make our 3-night stay very comfortable. There are plenty of shopping centers, eateries and coffee shops close by to make a home-away-from-home stay convenient and relatively inexpensive. We will return to this location when we want to be north of San Francisco, but with easy access to the city as needed. Note: I'd suggest asking for a room away from the Housekeeping storage areas if you are a late sleeper, one morning they were very noisy, the other two, I didn't even hear them.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Bakersfield, California","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-07-13T09:49:24Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Families","categoryLabel":"Families"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"7942","reviewId":"20399123","photos":[],"itinId":"377719347","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Laurie","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Good, deal, very pleasant environment.","reviewText":"This is the second time I have stayed here.

Seemed like it had been renovated recently. Staff was very friendly, check-in was kind of a wait but what can you do? Plus, their vending machines for pop only cost $1.50. When is the last time that happened?\r\n\r\nThe walls are a bit thin, so if you're offended by late-night/early-morning love-making, maybe get some earplugs or check elsewhere.

They charge for everything and anything including like almost 20 a day for parking and it'snot really that secure and very small spaces. If you have a truck than I wish you the best of luck getting in and out. The positive about this was its close to where I was supposed to be during my trip made my life easier. The sleeping conditions well bed was horrid and the sheets and stuff they put on there even worse.

For the price of almost 200 dollars I was fairly disappointed at the conditions of the hotel. The hotel is near the civic center and has paid parking which is an additional 43 or 47 dollars and is not included with the room. The parking garage has warning signs that they are not responsible for anything that may occur to your vehicle while it's parked and not to leave valuables. The lobby looks fairly nice, but once you walk into one of the rooms they look like they are not very well kept and need some maintenance. I had requested a non smoking room and the first thing I noticed was that the room I got smelled like cigarettes, not only that but the shower drains where not working properly. I switched rooms, but was not fully satisfied with the hotel. As soon as I steped outside there were people asking for money in front of the hotel entrance, not only that but inside the rooms there have warnings signs not to let strangers in your room, valuables left out, and never to open the door even if someone claims they are hotel staff. Which is not horrible, but I didn't feel safe and comfortable staying in that location and going outside. For the price I expected better. I suggest paying a little more and staying elsewhere, especially if you have children with you.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":1,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Corona,  Ca","reviewSubmissionTime":"2015-09-07T05:56:49Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"18204","reviewId":"55c012d48deca10906a222ea","photos":[],"itinId":"1112688924460","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"HMP MMD","managementResponses":[{"isFlaggable":false,"userNickname":"Jami","displayLocale":"en_us","date":"2015-08-08T00:00:38Z","id":"e12273ff-1640-4be3-862f-4d2e86bd5e33","response":"Thank you for reviewing our hotel.

Again, DeeDee was very helpful with directions and we arrived at the hotel garage, got our ticket and drove on through. Had to use the same ticket to get in door. Upon arrival at the hotel, we were greeted by a friendly staff member at the desk. (sorry I don't remember his name) He informed us that we were booked a handicapped room and asked if we really needed it. I replied that we did not want to be in the room if it was needed. The gentelman at the desk was able to switch us to another room. He did inform us that there was a daily parking fee. We were aware, it was stated on  our itenerary. The room and bathroom was very clean and neat with a TV. There was even a desk. I felt like a VIP. No microwave or small fridge, but we were only staying one night and was no problem for us. I think they would have been available upon request. There was a construction site across the street, but construction didn't start until 7:30am the next morning. No bother for us since we usually wake around 7. When we left the next morning, the cleaning staff was very friendly in asking how the game was and then told us to have a nice day.

I stayed at another hotel around the corner (Hotel Whitcomb) during my previous trip to the city, and I can honestly say Holiday Inn Civic Center is MUCH better. The facilities are clean and modern. The Executive Room I booked was clean, updated, had comfortable beds and best of all, a Balcony!! My only complaint was the $42 fee for SELF parking?? Really? The Whitcomb doesn't even charge that much and they actually valet your car. The bartender in the hotel restaurant (a middle aged woman with dirty blonde hair) wasn't very professional. Both times I went into the bar during my stay, she was more interested in talking to the various people in the bar she seemed to know personally. For example, her son and his girlfriend who were sitting at the bar, got great service... I guess maybe you need to share blood with her to get attention. It's a little awkward to stand there for 10+ minutes being ignored while she casually talks about nothing work related with her friends/family.

Once in there we're told they dont serve food and to go to the restaurant where the host finally seated us. We then waited for about 15 minutes for our server to come by.

But I don't like luxury hotels for a variety of reasons (don't like the tiny fees tacked onto everything, and don't like the attitude most of the time), so I have started booking my own rooms.\n\nMy stay at the Civic Center Holiday Inn was a huge, eye-opening treat! It reminded me of all the hotels I stayed in as a kid. It's true the area is unsavory, but you have to know that going in. If you're okay with that part, the staff are VERY professional, the rooms are clean, the WiFi is free, and everything is \"just right.\" Even on weekend nights, my room was quiet.\n\nI had a problem with my key one day, and the desk listened well to my issue, despite being busy, and sent an engineer to help me right away. I was impressed with every aspect of my stay, and recommend this place to anybody sick of the B.S. that the more swanky local places put you through for twice the cost.

Front desk service was, unfortunately, not so good: we asked for a cab to a local restaurant (some of us were in 4-inch heels) and the man who took our call actually said \"are you kidding me? It's three blocks away.\" He never called the cab. We hailed one from Market St, the nearest cross-street. Guys, I don't care how close the location is. If your guest asks for a cab, get them one, or explain how to best get one. Pretend your guest has never been in the city before, and be helpful. I've stayed in worse places in the city.

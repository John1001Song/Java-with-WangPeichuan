I enjoyed that stay, except I was disappointed they charged for parking, $10 per night. Overall -- except for some very loud guests -- I enjoyed my 2 night stay.\r\n\r\nMy recent stay was quite unpleasant. I arrived at the hotel and the lobby/reception area is in the process of renovation. This information is not listed on the website and does make a difference to guests. In fact, when I was in the elevator, a woman who had just checked, told me she would not have stayed at the hotel if she knew it was undergoing changes. At check in, I commented on how different the lobby area looked and was told about the changes being made to the restaurant and reception area. I went to my room and turned on the lights. Ants were on the desk. I immediately gathered my things, returned to the reception desk and asked for another room. I told the reception clerk about the ants and she assigned me to another room on the second floor, room 202. She told me it would be quiet, etc. Room 202 is across from the gas station and the freeway. There was another loud sound emanating from a structure on the hotel. I have NEVER stayed in a room that noisy, and I have stayed at many hotels. I was too tired to ask for another room and put in earplugs and tried to sleep. I awoke several times during the night because of the noise, which sounded like a generator. \r\n\r\nWhen I checked out, the reception desk had been moved into another location and workers were in my way.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":2,"ratingHotelCondition":1,"ratingService":1,"ratingRoomComfort":1,"positiveRemarks":"Nothing.","negativeRemarks":"If a hotel is in the process of renovation, that info should be on the website.

While this property may not be in the actual city of San Francisco, if you have a car, the city is but a short drive away. My only (somewhat minor) gripe was that our window faced the freeway, and there was a bit too much noise coming through the window even though it was closed. We had to fiddle with it a little to minimize the noise. I would recommend requesting a room on the opposite side for maximum comfort. All in all, a great hotel. Maybe not your 5-star hotel, but certainly a step up from some of the hotels in the surrounding SFO Airport / South San Francisco area.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Los Angeles, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-06-02T06:33:13Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"790579","reviewId":"18079660","photos":[],"itinId":"318596181","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Hal","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Good Deal","reviewText":"Well worth the Expedia rate.

Well located to Milbrae for Dinner, Daly City for shopping, excursion to Half Moon Bay. Ample free parking space (covered). Frequent shuttle to SF airport (although we didn't use it). Self-service laundry. Relatively inexpensive at the time (early Feb,'08). Disadvantages: Does not deserve the 3 star rating, and a misrepresentation of the Sheraton brand! Run-down Condition! Carpets Urgently need replacing, beds creak, beds & pillows too soft, doors need extra shove to lock, elevator is old and dirty. No bathroom scales in the entire hotel(guests need to check the weight of their suitcases to avoid hefty airline surcharges). Permanently waterlogged basement carpark. Front desk not very knowledgeable about local shops and gas stations.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":2,"ratingHotelCondition":1,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":1,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Seattle, Wa","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-02-15T08:00:33Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"790579","reviewId":"18079545","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Jackie","brandType":"Expedia","title":"We enjoyed our stay.","reviewText":"The friendly and professional staff made our stay exceptionally pleasurable.

The rooms are clean and the service is good. Their advertisements say they have double pane windows to prevent noise from the freeway. Actually, I was a bit hesitant to stay here as I thought there would be a lot of noise. But I guess the double pane windows work fine and there is virtually no noise in the rooms. The heater/AC in the room did not work. They offered to change our room or give us a portable heater. We took the heater and worked just fine. (We stayed there in December). It is just nect to Freewat 101. Take So Airport Blvd exit and it is right at the exit. Overall, this is a very nice, warm and quiet hotel and would definately recommend it.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2004-12-26T08:56:58Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"790579","reviewId":"18079669","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Bob","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Overnighter","reviewText":"Stayed her with wife overnite between flights on way back to NY from Honolulu to try to break up the jet lag.

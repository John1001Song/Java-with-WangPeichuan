The room was impeccably clean and plenty spacious. We were on the second floor and the view was directly across the street to the sides of other buildings and we were not very far above the heads of the folks going by on the top of the double decker buses. Street noise wasn't an issue except a car alarm went of briefly about 0530. A higher floor might have been a bit better view but now that I've seen it we'd likely not get a VIEW room next time. Location was maybe 50 feet from the Chinatown Dragon Gate. Perfect . The staff was friendly and helpful. I loved the toiletries and the bed was amazing. The crowning gem was that when our friend came to pick us up we set 5 bags of various sizes down on the sidewalk before putting them in the car. We each grabbed one or two, commented about where there was more room to stuff things, got in the car and left..leaving one of the bags on the sidewalk. 30 minutes later we got to our next destination only to realize nobody had picked up the last bag. Quick call back to the hotel and they reassured us they had it (with not contact info on it) behind the counter! We'll be back!!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"Location. Staff. Cleanliness.

Once I got over this, I started searching for the bargains. I'm moderately fussy and wanted to stay quite centrally but a few blocks away from the major attractions. Orchard Garden seemed to fit the bill and looking through other reviews made up my mind.\n\nI was made very welcome on arrival (and received warm greetings as I departed) and was able to check in at 11 despite not having requested early check-in ahead of time. The room was spotless and well presented, and incredibly quiet. I had requested a room on the upper floors at the back so it would be quieter, but I imagine most rooms would be quiet as they are all double-glazed and the doors are thick.\n\nThe location is great - about 20 yards from the Dragon Gate of Chinatown - so you could be at Union Square in 10 minutes, on the BART in 5 and at Embarcadero in under 15.

Don't expect all the amenities of a big hotel chain though. The room was clean, a bit tight (but its the city, so its expected), huge bathroom (which I love and need more than a large bedroom), and FREE WIFI. We had a bad view, but did not care since we didn't spend much time in the room. This hotel would be bad for children, its a very small hotel (small lobby, small restaurant, narrow hallways) and you can hear outside the room a bit (the walls to the hallway were a little thin). Even though the restaurant and bar was small, it was still a great place to grab a drink or snack before going out to dinner. Drinks were good and the one dish I tried was really yummy and fresh. The bartender was great, knew her stuff and remembered what we liked to drink. The whole staff is really nice, always greeting you and saying to have a good day/night on your way out. Also the location is BRILLIANT! Walking distance from the Financial District and Union Square but without all the touristy crowds and noise. Also it borders the entrance to China Town, which was great if you need to run out quick for souvenirs or snacks. There is a Starbucks less than a block in each direction and bus stops are between 2-5 blocks way depending on where you are headed. And you are literally surrounded by restaurants.

They didn't notify us, they just left a replacement glass from the restaurant. Very strange. When we complained, the guest services gave us a ~$20 bottle of wine. Reasonable trade given the broken glass was a souvenir. Although, the hotel probably should've been more forthright about the incident.\n\nThe rooms are clean with new furniture.

You can walk through Chinatown to get to Little Italy and right to Fisherman's Wharf. Go to Pier 39 for the eating and shopping. The Gharadelli Chocolate Factory is wonderful and if you get one of those tourist guides you can claim 10% discount. The Golden Gate Bridge is a must but if you take a boat make sure you bring a jacket as it gets very cold and windy. You can also hire a bike to cycle across and take the ferry back.\n\nYou can walk to almost anywhere so make sure you bring your walking shoes as those hill tops are very steep or take a cable car.\n\nThe Cheesecake Factory in Macy's is fun, but try to get there early to save waiting for a table. The Westfield is not that big so don't expect a huge shopping mall. The majority of the high street and designer shops are on Union Square. There's a Walgreens at nearly every block for toiletries, medicines, food and drink etc.\n\nSan Francisco is a fun city and you will enjoy it as much as we did!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"London","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-06-16T12:56:43Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Kelly","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"hotelId":"1515923","reviewId":"18798421","photos":[],"itinId":"361166638","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Hans","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great location with great food and tourism options close by!","reviewText":"This place is in a great location, literally across from \"Cafe de la Presse\" (very good breakfast) and \"Le Central\" (great dinner). 2 minutes from the Bush Street cable car stop and literally 20 steps away from the Chinatown gate.\n\nThe hotel itself is great, clean, friendly and helpful service (we asked for maps, help with cabs and limos, all dealt within minutes and with a smile).

The room was small, but very clean and comfortable. The AC worked well and kept the room from becoming stuffy. Although, it is a completely non-smoking hotel, someone in one of the neighboring 2 rooms was smoking and it came under the door into my room. This happened at night, and when I complained to the night clerk at the front desk, he said that he couldn't do anything about it and that the maids would check it out the next day. I had to put a bedspread under the door to keep the smell out. The next morning, the same person was smoking again, so I complained to the morning desk clerk. She immediately sent someone up to the floor to investigate and said that that is what the night clerk should have done too. It is not the hotel's fault that someone was smoking, but I do think that since it is a non-smoking hotel, the night clerk should have been more responsible in seeing that the smoking ceased. In spite of this, I would stay here again. My hotel stay here was much more comfortable and quiet than my previous stay at the SF based chain hotel around the corner that is famous for accepting dogs (which tend to bark all night.)","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Seattle, WA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-08-31T03:41:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"1515923","reviewId":"18798542","photos":[],"itinId":"316567713","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Kevin","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great hotel","reviewText":"The hotel was very nice and clean, and the staff was very accomodating.

I'm no eco-warrior but am in total agreement with the hotels request not to change the bedding during our short stay. And well done for including recycling bins. I'm glad to see the Gideon bible won't be going to landfill. Take the BART from the airport to the Montgomery stop for about $5 (a taxi will cost you $30+) and take a 5 min walk to the hotel. Invest in a MUNI passport for your stay which will get you free access to all public transport, apart from the BART.

It was conveniently located. We walked to the SFMOMA, Union Square shopping, Chinatown, etc. I had read in other reviews that the room was small, and it definitely was smaller than expected. The bathroom was quite unnecessarily large, and I think they should have added that extra square footage to the room. The bathroom door slides closed, but doesn't close all of the way. If you are at all embarrassed by someone overhearing your bathroom business, this might not be ideal. I also had read that the hotel offers Aveda products, but this is not the case (at least not in the room where we stayed). The room service menu is quite lacking which is a downfall because the Financial District (where this is located) doesn't exactly offer a sit down breakfast. Expect to pay quite a bit for just toast and coffee. The valet parking was 4 bucks more than listed on the website, but I now wish we had done it since this really is the going rate in town. Overall, the hotel was good. It was quiet, clean and simple enough for our needs. I wouldn't recommend this for families, but might be great for a business traveler or a couples' weekend getaway.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Scotts Valley, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-06-25T18:49:08Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"3","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_gb","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"1515923","reviewId":"18798356","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"2057","userNickname":"Jeremy","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Excellent Hotel, Excellent Location","reviewText":"Fairly new hotel just on the edge of downtown financial area next door to the Chinatown Gate.

Is it clean? 2. Does it attract a quiet sort of fellow traveler? 3. Is it affordable? 4. Does the staff practice decent customer service? By these standards, the Orchard Garden is a great hotel. Our room was clean, quiet, and comfortable. We had a room near the housekeeping closet, and although we could hear the staff talking as they were working, the noise was not intrusive. The other guests did not seem rowdy or loud in their rooms or in the halls. The hotel was quite affordable since we got a great price (by San Francisco standards) through Expedia. The front desk staff seemed pleasant and helpful enough. The concierge was extremely helpful and friendly. The only caution I would mention to people considering this hotel applies to those with mobility issues. The door to our bathroom was a heavy, wooden sliding panel. It looked great, but if you have any motion or strength restrictions (as one of us did on this trip--an injured shoulder), this chic feature becomes a bit of a pain to operate. Even this should not dissuade you from staying at the Orchard Garden. I mention it only for information.

From bellman to waiter, the entire team is animated about making it a wonderful stay. Be sure to have dinner in the restaurant - the cheese plate is exceptional. Could use a few more veg options, but the chef put together something for me on the fly and I loved it. The fitness center is just a treadmill, stepper and bike, but it did keep me from skipping my workout if I'd had to go out in the cold in the morning. A wonderful environmental concept and executed beautifully.

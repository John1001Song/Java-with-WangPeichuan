That being said, it was pretty smooth sailing from there. We got a room upgrade (with free WiFi), which made the whole family happy. The pool was great, the complimentary breakfasts were FAR beyond what we expected - EXCELLENT! Very healthy, many choices, great cooking...a definite selling point for the hotel. The free shuttle into town on Friday and Saturday was awesome, as well - a great program!

It was ok - the food was fine but service was a bit slow. We went back Sunday night, and our meal  was so delayed (over an hour!) that our meal was comp'ed.

The two room suites and the inclusive breakfast serve us well. Overall this is a very good hotel. We had a couple of minor issues that we raised. Firstly our daughters (aged 16-18) were in the queen beds and my wife and I slept on the double fold down sofabed. The mattress on the fold down was basically shot and we could feel every spring. It was the most uncomfortable night I have EVER spent in a hotel. The staff gave us a mattress pad the next day which made it bearable, however it is clear that the mattress really needed replacing, and I didn't get the impression that the staff ever checked the fold downs. Secondly after a days sightseeing in San Fran we wanted a quiet swim in the pool. The hotel has a rule that it should be adults only in the pool after 10pm, however it is not policed, so at 10.10 I asked reception to intervene with the significant number of totally unsupervised young kids. By 10.20 I was still waiting so I ended up asking the kids to leave myself. Eventually a staff security member showed up at 10.25. It would be a simple thing to have a rota to check the 10pm cut off. \r\nIf you are sightseeing in San Francisco it is not a convenient hotel. It is around 8 miles to Fisherman's Wharf, the local train station is not somewhere you want to be coming back to after dark, and taking the hotel courtesy bus to the airport and then a train takes over an hour.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"Overall comfortable and great breakfast","negativeRemarks":"Quality of sofabeds!","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"N","userLocation":"London UK","reviewSubmissionTime":"2014-07-29T14:01:17Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"2981","reviewId":"10000207588","photos":[],"itinId":"177629373741","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"MatLaz","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Recommend to anyone going to SFO for bus./pleasure","reviewText":"They are upgrading now so will be all 5's when they are done.  \r\nParking fee was the only drag.  \r\nFree breakfast / bar snacks / 2 cocktails everyday of your stay.\r\nFree shuttle to Pier on weekends\r\n\r\nWas nervous about the location having not been there but after deciding to get a car it worked out great to be not tied to just fishermans wharf area.

However, once you're downtown your return to the hotel via the shuttle is not guarantied (believe it or not !). The trip to San Francisco is on a first come first serve basis with the driver controlling how many people are boarding, while the trip from San Francisco is more on a ''I'm big and impolite'' basis. For the return, the guests are told to meet at a specific address downtown which is fine in theory, the problem is when people line up (or pile up...) at this address, the first come first serve principle does not seem to exist anymore and some people will seriously show a different nature by pushing and cutting people off to get on the bus (I've seen it live before my eyes). The hotel should introduce a reservation system with confirmed return times putting the responsibility on the guests to plan their return accordingly: you have a time-stamped ticket = you board, you don't have a time-stamped ticket (or one with the wrong time) = you board only if there is room in the bus.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"- Proximity to the South San Francisco CalTrain station, 5 minutes walk - Atrium atmosphere - Complementary breakfast & manager's evening cocktail","negativeRemarks":"- Complimentary breakfast should stay open later - Not enough variation in the breakfast - Return on the complimentary shuttle from downtown SF","locationRemarks":"- Not too many things to do or visit near the hotel.

The kids were very uncomfortable in the fold out couch. Te police were called to someone’s room and I had to speak to someone twice about removing a mistaken water bottle charge. But I had to call the front desk again to ask for 2 blankets and 2 towels. The blankets arrived about an hour later. It was 11:00pm how busy could they be?

Embassy Suites proved vigilant as the rooms were quiet all night long.Then we went to the pool; I overheard the posted security turn away a mom with 6 kids, one adult per 5 children - she was over the limit!. Later when we got to the pool, it was total chaos! Obviously no one ensures the adults STAY. There was a group of 25+ kids & only 3 adults chaperoning them. These kids were obnoxious, loud & disobeyed pool rules. The guard came in a few times to shout warnings then the next thing I know the pool was shut down. The large group got out without complaint, getting kicked out was not new to them! A few parents like me who actually paid attn to their children tried very hard to reason with mgmt but we were punished with everyone else.

The rooms look good since they have been newly renovated. As I discovered, these renovations were cosmetic not substantial. The room smelled like smoke to me. The entire floor was supposed to be smoke-free, but it seemed that staff had sprayed the air with some deodorizing spray and when that cleared the smoke smell was noticeable. The design of the hotel makes it an echo chamber for noise generated by patrons down in the restaurant and bar. There were people running up and down the hall and at one point I heard drumming, as if from big bongo-like drums, coming from a room nearby.

The heat and air conditioning are both centrally controlled by the hotel; you cannot adjust your room temperature. Not a good thing!! The suites are roomy but cannot enjoy the stay due to frigid room temperature. It is not easy or fun to wrap Christmas presents with gloves and a coat on. The blankets are thin so ask for a few extra. The most uncomfortable night I have spent in any hotel, even colder than in Minnesota.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":1,"ratingRoomComfort":1,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Sacramento, Ca","reviewSubmissionTime":"2006-12-27T18:55:47Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"2981","reviewId":"17818770","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Angie","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Family fun","reviewText":"Great place, excellent complimentary breakfast.

The complementry evening reception hour and made to order breakfast, really made the hotel the best value for your money when visiting San Francisco that is only 20-25 minutes from downtown. Other than not having a business center, they did give guest access to the internet by using the system in the gift shop. The most important part of my stay at the hotel was the customer service I received from the hotel staff. They were really helpful and very informative on information pertaining to things to do while visiting the Bay area. The front desk personnel also helped me to expedite the confirmation of return plane tickets back home. Hope all travelors that visit the San Francisco area try a stay at the Embassy Suites to experience the great stay I had while on vacation!!!!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Las Vegas","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-06-01T03:48:24Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"2981","reviewId":"17818733","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Karen","brandType":"Expedia","title":"excellent stay","reviewText":"many amenities that I wasn't expecting. hot breakfast, happy hour munchies and drinks. beautiful scenery inside with koi fish. picked me up and dropped me off so i could sight see.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Phoenix, AZ","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-05-27T19:49:16Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"2981","reviewId":"17818800","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":2,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Corina","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Would not return","reviewText":"IT was TOOOOOO LOUD!!

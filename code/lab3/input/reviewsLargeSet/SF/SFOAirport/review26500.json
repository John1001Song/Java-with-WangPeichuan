I also think they should have at least some baked goods at a minimum in the morning. Much lesser hotels have a nice breakfast. The room, not bad, but not good. Toilet paper holder inoperative, really? Pull the roll and it hits the floor. Old shower/bath fixtures, hotel is under renovation and it needs it. Housekeeping couldn't even bother to replenish the soap. Had to find some buried in my suitcase from another hotel on the last morning to take a shower.The bar, overpriced watered down drinks, stick to beer and even that is high. Hit or miss with bartenders, some very good and wonderful, some not so much. Insulting, I am a working man, so I don't have a 3 piece suit on, still deserve to be treated with respect. This place lost a lot of sales from me for their service, not just drinks but food. A very disappointing experience.

The desk, night stands, the bathroom counter, COVERED in a thick layer of dust. I have allergies as do my children and this room triggered an allergy attack. Since each surface was covered in dust I imagine the pillows and bed covers were as well. When room service brought up our breakfast I was too grossed out to eat my meal because as the trays were set out there was dust blowing around. I took it upon myself to clean our room. Not something I really want to do when I'm on vacation- and I NEVER go on vacation so I was really upset that a hotel of this rating and such great standards let this happen. I also found a note that was signed saying that our room was prepared personally. It absolutely was not. The hotel was also under construction and it was LOUD. There was a jack hammer cutting through cement and thats all I could hear while at the hotel. I would never stay here again.

The hotel is spacious and airy, a bit noisy with the waterfall, but that tends to act as white noise. This trip had a couple of glitches. The night I was there, this large hotel had two restaurants open: the bar restaurant, which is noisy and dark; and the mezzanine restaurant--not the large one, the small one with maybe a dozen tables. I waited for over half an hour for a table. That is ridiculous. The food was good--not great, but definitely edible even though I was cranky after waiting so long. The other glitch was in checking out. I called for a bellman, waited fifteen minutes and finally hauled my collections of bags down to the lobby.\nIf you are not willing to use the services, when you can get them, the place is a lot of work. It is large. The parking ramp is detached, so it is a short walk between the hotel and the ramp.

Everything is of a very high quality but i was disappointed that our deal didnt include breakfast. I was also not able to tell when booking this room, what the bed situation would be. I called the hotel immediately after booking it on Expedia but they were not yet aware of my booking. They promised to take down my details and ensure i was given a room with 2 queen beds, but on arrival they didnt seem to have that information on record. The out door spa requires renovation and is not to the standard of the rest of the hotel. There are a few little tiles missing and paint peeling off the concreted edge. Overall a great experience but in future a cheaper hotel that includes breakfast would suit me better. Still nice to have the free shuttle to get to and from the airport.

The Millbrae station is just about 2 miles down the road with an abundance of parking for you to leave your car at while you're in 'Frisco (which most BART stations don't even provide). And it's far enough away from the city, that once you're wore out from the fast-paced lifestyle downtown, you can return to your hotel via BART and enjoy some peace and quiet. The only downfall to our whole time there was...once we arrived and went to check-in, we were informed that the \"Bay View\" room which we paid extra for was not available because they give first priority to those who book directly through them, and don't use third-party sites, such as Expedia. So instead we settled for a freeway view room and they tried to make it up to us with free parking (normally costing $20/day). It would've been nice if they could have contacted Expedia prior to our arrival and told them to shoot me an e-mail and let me know, so I don't need to find out at the registration desk.

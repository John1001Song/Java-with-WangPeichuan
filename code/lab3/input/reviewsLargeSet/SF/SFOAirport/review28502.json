The shuttle to crowns plaza sfo skipped out stop, even as we chased after the bus. My girlfriend and I waited over an hour for that same shuttle to finally pick us up. When we called the front desk, they once said the shuttle would be arriving in less than 20 minutes. 30 minutes later, we called again and they said that the shuttle was at the terminal right before our stop. Other shuttle drivers who had made circles around the shuttle circuit offered to give us a ride \"if we gave them something on the side\". I wasn't happy about that treatment either. \r\n\r\nThe shuttle driver arrived 30 minutes after that call. When I informed the concierge about the experience, she just said she'd let the manager know. \r\n\r\nI know it's awful to knock points of the rating for a hotel based on the service of a complimentary shuttle, but over the week we were there, we'd become pretty familiar with the drivers (who, it turns out, all drive for other hotels, same company I guess). Transportation to the hotel was simply too inconsistent, and I was left with the feeling that if the driver's weren't incentivized, there was little they were willing to do to help us out.

The products (shampoo, conditioner-I had my own soap) smelled just like PineSol! I had no choice at that point, and had to suffer with the smell all day on a long, multi-stop, plane ride home. Lesson learned! My daughter had to pay $2 to park in the parking lot for 1/2 hour so she could say goodbye. There was no complimentary breakfast, but they did have a lounge on the 10th floor that \"might\" have donuts by the time I had to leave in the morning, and had 24-hour latte's.

I thought she was just being accurate.  We got to our room and we're shocked. One bed for my wife, my two sons and I. We went back to reception and said this was not possible.  She said that was the reason she kept repeating the size of the bed. She was a little miffed, but stayed polite. She changed our room to two beds. TWO VERY SMALL BEDS! I though maybe they were two full beds.  THE Room WAS VERY SMALL.  She was not happy about having to change our room because Expedia should know what they are doing. The hotel looked busy also, so she had to look for a room. The lady in reception actually allowed us to check in early. That was very very nice.  The \"breakfast included\" was only for two people.  I don't remember this being stated When I made our reservation. We stayed 3 nights. I guess parking is like gold, because we had to pay $20 parking per night. That was stated in my reservation,  but odd for renting out a hotel room. Parking in San Francisco is extremely expensive. We actually paid $575 for our mini room, PLUS $60 for parking!  YES, A TOTAL OF $630 for 3 nights! I have made reservations from Expedia many many many times. This was the first time I have been disappointed. I guess no one is perfect.

We are currently finalizing our plans for our hotel renovation, part of which is replacing all the windows, which is set to be completed early this year.\n\nThe fire alarm was a result of another guest smoking on their floor and setting off our fire alarm.

However, anytime we do not have enough space on the shuttle, we always provide cabs to the airport and make sure to pay for the transportation for those guests.

Overall, the facility is mediocre and in need of renovation (feels a bit like the set of Mad Men). But, it's an airport hotel, so our expectations were minimal (decent night's sleep with minimal hassle, reliable airport transportation). Unfortunately, those minimal expectations were not met.\n\nFire alarm at 2 AM the first night (false alarm); long lines at check-in both times; first set of room keys didn't work (we were not the only unfortunate guests), and no apparent bellman or luggage help at all.\n\nBut the most egregious experience occurred on the morning we left for the airport. Shuttle van pulled up on time (7 AM), but the driver had another stop to make (Holiday Inn down the road), and therefore kept half the bus empty, telling about 15 people (airline personnel, tourists with luggage, families) that they would need to wait another 30 minutes. Shouting, shoving, profanities, all of which could have been avoided with more responsible management.\n\nThere's a big sign at the front desk that says \"This Crowne Plaza hotel is managed by Rim Hospitality\".

For the price, the accommodations and service were OK, pretty much what I would have expected. The main downside was the traffic noise. The hotel sits on US 101 and the traffic is constant through the night and permeates the rooms. We were on the 5th floor, nowhere near high enough to escape it. Given the high prices of decent hotel rooms in the San Francisco area, I would have hoped they could make the rooms a little more quiet. Additional fees for internet and parking, standard I know but still seems unreasonable given what your are paying. We got one of Expedia's \"mystery hotel\" deals, which only knocked $20 off the price we would have paid. Restaurant on the premises with a full buffet breakfast for $15.

Many customers have to wait for a long time until they get service, and this is due to the fact that there were only three people working at a time when there were over fifty customers.\n\nOverall, this is a very good hotel.

This had bars of soap that were nothing by the end of my shower, shampoo that was good for 2 uses and no q-tips or anything else. When I went to the front desk to ask about getting a couple of Q-tips, they said that they did not have anything and I would have to wait till the gift shop opened. That of course, did me no good at 7 am. When I checked in the afternoon, the gift shop wanted $3.95 for a package of 20 Q-tips.

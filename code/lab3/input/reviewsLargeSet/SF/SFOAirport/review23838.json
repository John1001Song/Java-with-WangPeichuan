They have invested heavily in keeping it contemporary with strict attention to the comfort of their guests.  The lobby itself is so visually appealing with beauty everywhere in terms of the interior design.  Sometimes after I check in, I just stand there and take in the artistry in the lobby.  I want their interior designer for my office and my home!   The shuttle service to the airport is excellent, too, running every 10 minutes.  I'd recommend allowing some extra time, as the shuttle stops at another hotel on the way to the airport.\r\nMy only suggestion for improvement of this hotel is to have longer hours for the Starbucks that is in the lobby.   During the time I stood there taking in the beauty, I saw several people go up to the Starbucks near the reception desk and then be a bit surprised that it was closed.   I know I felt the same way.   It forces people to purchase items from the hotel \"gift shop\" and a pint container of Haagen-Daz ice cream costs $7.  More options would be great.  But overall, this place is awesome.

Apparently this is a practice for Marriott, and you can find a Washington Post story about it. I wish I had known before we booked. I doubt we'll ever book Marriott again. They will place a holding fee on your card equal to your total charge plus an additional amount. Unfortunately for us, they charged the holding fee twice and when the final charge was put through, the holding fees didn't come off. So we wound up with around $1,750 of pending charges for a two-night stay, which maxed out the credit card during the middle of our travel. Instead of enjoying our vacation, we had to spend time talking to the Marriott accountant and the credit card company trying to get the issue resolved so that we could continue traveling.

The room was large with a very comfortable bed and it was extremely quiet. The hotel was in excellent condition. The rooms have excellent views of the water (and also the airport depending on what side you are on).\nThe hotel provides a free shuttle back and forth to SFO which is very handy. From SFO you can either catch a flight out or take BART into San Francisco. Bart is $8.10 and approx 35 minutes to Moscone or 45 to Fisherman's Wharf connecting with the trolley.\nThe only downside to the hotel is the parking. Parking is around $35 per day - about the same amount as parking overnight in downtown San Francisco (which is a pain). First 30 minutes is free.\nFree shuttle to the airport starts at 4:30 in the morning and stops at the other hotels. Other hotels evidently all share a shuttle. There was only one other stop between this hotel and SFO. SFO is extremely busy early in the morning with flights to the east coast. So, if you have a 6 am flight you'll want to leave around 4 am which will thus require a cab. We barely made our 6:00 am flight on a Sunday because the airport was so busy!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"New Haven, CT","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-10-08T03:25:37Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"23838","reviewId":"17950271","photos":[],"itinId":"339317158","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":2,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Glenn","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Only if you have no other options","reviewText":"This was one of the worst expensive hotel rooms that I have ever stayed in.

It was hard to breath in the room and the windows were screwed shut, no relief. There's nowhere in the neighborhood to eat so you're captured and the food prices in the lobby cafe reflected it. It did have a Starbucks in the lobby but was poorly stocked with pastries and no sandwiches. The shuttle bus to and from the airport was nice and fast so that's a plus.

This is quite convenient if you want to take the BART into the city as well. The hotel is lovely and the room was beautiful and immaculate. Service was great. Restaurant offers buffet breakfast starting early which is convenient. My only suggestions would be to call the hotel for a shuttle if you arrive after 11:30pm, and expect a wait that late at night. Otherwise shuttles come pretty frequently routinely. Also I had a room on the same floor near the meeting rooms, and it so happened a party was scheduled in a meeting room one night of my stay. Some of the noise did carry to my room, and lasted until midnight. You might inquire about room locations and scheduled events to avoid this problem.

The lobby was immaculate, but our very expensive dinner in the steakhouse was very disappointing, they failed to have the champagne waiting in our room (as had been prearranged and paid), we had long waits for car valet service on several days, our non-smoking room was directly across the hall from smoking rooms which made no sense to me at all. Overall our room was not befitting a four star hotel - in my opinion. It was a tremendous value for our rate though, and they did remove the restaurant charge from our bill without us asking, so they redeemed themselves somewhat with that service.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Orange County, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2006-03-15T07:53:17Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"23838","reviewId":"17950300","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Ryan","brandType":"Expedia","title":"The best hotel at the San Francisco Airport","reviewText":"Very nice hotel and great location","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Modesto, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2006-01-10T05:06:40Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"23838","reviewId":"17950204","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Satish","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Okay","reviewText":"Overall the hotel was okay but had few negatives.

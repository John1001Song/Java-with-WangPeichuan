Also, other customers smoked just outside the entrance to this building, so we had to walk through a cloud of smoke to enter the building. In addition, room 446 had a shower head, but no shower system. Only the bath fawcet worked and there was no lever to switch over to shower (see photos attached). Room 444 did have a lever and the shower worked so we all shared the one. Finally, when she unplugged our iPad from the outlet in 444, there was popping sound and smoke and our daughter's hand was zapped and the electricity went out.

The poop bag dispenser was empty the entire 4 nights I was there, and though I had my own bags, others clearly didn't and poop was left in numerous places on the grass. Hotel staff picked it up over time, but supplied bags in the dispenser might have helped it stay cleaner.\n\nContinental breakfast was fair, but to get to it I had to leave my building, cross over the unused railroad tracks, and then walk past most of neighboring building to get to breakfast room. Wasn't very conducive to having breakfast with having to put my dog into my car or leave in my room.

She suggested that we park in the Denny’s parking, which is located next to the hotel. When we checked about this with the manager at Denny’s, of course she disagreed. We didn’t want to risk our car being towed. We finally parked in front of the hotel in the fire lane upon the recommendation of the front desk. It was a very stressful experience after traveling long hours.\n2. We were assigned to a smoking room although we reserved for a non-smoking room. The room was really disgusting. The carpet had many dirty spots. After just spending one night in this room, our clothes, including our jackets, smelled very strongly of cigarettes. All of us found ourselves coughing.\n3. The toilet’s was not working. When we called the front disk, no one came to help us for a long while. When we called a second time, the security guard came to our room and handed us a toilet plunger!

The room was very clean and cozy. There are actually two seperate buildings to the hotel. I stayed in the rear building past the railroad tracks(sounds scary and loud but it wasn't). This was far enough from the warehouse so I didn't hear anything. I would recommend this building if your worried about the noise from warehouse. The only noise I heard was from the occasional departing jet traffic from SFO. Not a big deal in my opinion. The walls seem thick enough to block out the noise from our neighbors. \n\nThe hotel room itself was very clean and our non-smoking room did not have any odor at all. Everything worked and the staff was friendly. I did not have the continental breakfast so I can't comment on how that was... I would recommend this hotel if you don't mind driving 10-15 minutes into SF and getting the most for your money at a hotel that was nice and clean with free parking too.

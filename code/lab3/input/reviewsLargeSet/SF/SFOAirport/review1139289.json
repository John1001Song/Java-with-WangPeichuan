I was a bit wary after reading the reviews, but I needed a place to stay for a few days in San Francisco and this one was great. We ended up getting there after 2 am in the morning due to a flight delay but the owner had absolutely no problems with it and gave us our room key quickly. Parking was super useful, a bit cramped, but we never had a problem finding a place to park in the covered lot for any of the three days we were there for. Room was larger than I expected with a sofa, huge bed, and desk, coffee tablet, dresser, etc. Everything was clean and the cleaning facilities were spot on each day. Breakfast was each morning with a variety of tea, coffee, fruits, packaged danishes, etc It was enough to get your day started and for the price, the hotel was great. Close by to the airport, they called us a taxi on the first day to go pick up our rental car which was great, and everything that we wanted to see was close by by car.

They gave us 2 breakfast coupon and keep offering us more (I stay only 2 nights, why do we need that much) No apologies from a manager while we are waiting in the room. No call, no show, nothing.

We checked in very late (3:00 A.M.) as we had already given the heads up we would be doing. Upon check in it was difficult to find our second room because it came through as two separate reservations one under my last name and one under my last name with a 1.\n\nThe wi-fi worked well and we got it free which is always a plus. Wasn't sure if it was supposed to be free but it was. Upon returning the first night, our entire floor smelled strongly of Marijuana. With a 1,2,3 year old between our two rooms we told the staff we could simply not bare the smell as it was now creeping into our rooms once we had opened the door. We were immediately sent to a different floor and a member of the staff came to our door within minutes with the new keys. We were also given access to free breakfast in the lounge (though this is something I'd love to see Hilton's simply offer for their price, along with free wi-fi at all locations). The staff the first night was not personable, the staff the second night was great. Checkout was again not a very personable experience.\n\nAll in all the hotel is nice, not amazing for a Hilton property. The price we got was nearly $40 cheaper on Expedia than when we had looked on the hotel site. We could stay here again in the future for the right price, but other hotels in the immediate area have been higher on our experience list in past years.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"Staff meeting needs which were out of their control.

Upon arrival, the staff were friendly, helpful and attentive. The free airport shuttle was definitely a plus as well! The only negative, and I felt it was a big one, was our room service experience. We were pretty tired and hungry, and had to get an early start the next morning, so we chose to dine in our room. I ordered a turkey sandwich and fries. My wife ordered eggs, bacon and rye toast. It took about 40 minutes to get the food. When it came, the person delivering it took the lids off, waited just long enough to get his tip, and disappeared with the food covers. The food was barely warm and my wife's toast was missing. I tried to catch the server, but no luck. I immediately called room service and explained. They were apologetic and said they would fix it right away. Finally, after another half hour elapsed, I called back and told them to forget it.

We were never asked if we needed help with our luggage, and we were never asked if we needed or wanted to valet our car. When I needed to have my room keys reprogrammed (because they didn't work), I stood for at least five or six minutes waiting for someone to aknowledge me.

It is close to the airport, yet far enough from the hustle and bustle of downtown San Francisco. It sits right on the bay for a relaxing atmosphere. It became our home away from home and a sanctuary for our souls. The room was amazing, the staff even more incredible. We actually got to know them from our extended stay..and they treated us like family. Our family also came to stay there and loved it as well. It has a free shuttle to the airport and to the Burlingame shopping district. It is close to Caltrain which was our primary means of travel in and out of the city.

It's trapped in a 70s time warp & everything was as battered as if it really had been around since the 70s. Corridors are like a prison. Don't think the bathroom had been cleaned, there were marks on toilet seat & overflow was moudly. Bath so old the bottom was black. Valance sheets on the beds were covered in stains. Stains on furniture, walls & unrequested connecting door. Maid clearly hadn't dusted anywhere she thought people wouldn't notice. This is the noisiet hotel I've ever stayed at, the noise from the airport was unbelievable & doors & walls were so thin I could hear everything from every direction. Sleep was impossible and beds uncomfy. Paid for a bay view but had to crane my neck to see further than the airport car park & dirty lake. The pool's tiny, claustrophobic & dirty. Burlingame shuttle's good but only runs 11:47-7:51. I was here for the Shoreline Amphitheatre & the only reason I stayed here was because the reviews are so good.

We had a nice room with water view. Room service was good as was the service at the lounge downstairs. We were able to use the shuttle at 4:00am to the airport and our driver even produced two cups of coffee while we waited to go to the airport when we asked it of him. Overall very pleased with the choice to stay here prior to our flight.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Union Hall , VA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-08-26T13:04:32Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"12345","reviewId":"18424860","photos":[],"itinId":"286915005","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Shannon","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Parking Problem","reviewText":"The only problem we had was trying to park on the weekend.

The nearest BART station is at SFO and the shuttle from the hotel to SFO was running every hour. It was also about $8.00 per person to take BART one-way into the City which adds up quickly for a family.

Good facilities with known name brand.","reviewText":"I would say this hotel is great for its room overall, balancing out its room quality, tidiness and maintenance (which is not very good). However I felt upset when I found out at checkout that they do charge $16 per day for self parking at the hotel where no other businesses near by even need a gate for their parking. And there is no alternatives for parking except on side streets at the residential streets close to the hotel. They said everyone else (hotels) near the airport charges parking. But they are 4 miles off the SFO airport. Also, no one tells me at check in and other places except on a sign at the parking gate at the less obvious place. I felt like I am being asked to pay for a meal on a 15 hours flight without advance notice which you don't have much choice at the moment. Talking to the manager to complain only yield one day waived parking out of the 3 days stay. I didn't take the offer since I dont' think it is right biz practice and the one day charge isn't really that significant. That left a very bad impression at check out to say the least.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":1,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"LAX","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-07-03T22:49:56Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"4044","reviewId":"20152930","photos":[],"itinId":"280349295","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Dewayne","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Weekend Getaway","reviewText":"I have stayed here multiple times and the experience has always been excellent.

The shuttle schedule is frequent (between 10 - 20 min/bus depending on the time of day).  I believe there are at least 2 shuttle buses running at all times. \r\nThere is free wi-fi in the main lobby. \r\n\r\nThe nearest BART station is Millbrae, which is an easy 15 min walk from the hotel.  Or, you can take the free shuttle to the airport and take the BART from the airport.  From Millbrae station to downtown SF is about 30 min at $4.85/adult. From the airport to downtown SF is about 25 min at $8.65/adult (one less stop but added fare because of security costs).  At night, if alone, I would use the airport station + free shuttle if only because the 15 min walk is pretty empty (the area is suburban sprawl).  There are some restaurants within walking distance.  \r\n\r\nMy only complaint are the thin walls.  I am a deep sleeper but the walls are pretty thin - I could hear my neighbours hollering at each other during an early check-out, staff in the hallways, and at one point, I woke to someone else's cell phone alarm.  Surprisingly, I was never bothered by any noise from the airport. If you have an early flight, this is an ideal hotel to stay at.

Shuttle was right on time, and the driver could not have been more helpful. We noticed that several airlines seem to use the Westin for their crew layovers. We had an excellent meal at the in-hotel restaurant, Grill and Vine. My son gave high marks to the exercise/fitness facility as well. Check-in was expedient; valet kindly held our rental car (for a nominal fee) for thirty minutes while we got settled, and I then returned the rental car to the Airport Rental Car Center. We had a great walk on the linear park across from the hotel- excellent for a quick run or stroll along the Bay, with great views of planes landing and taking off from SFO, and at night, the lights of the East Bay. We all were impressed with the \"green\" environmental approach of the Westin- not something one finds in many other hotels, but this is improving.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"The logistics of returning a rental car and then getting back to the hotel.

I have made this request at numerous 4 Star hotels in the past and have never had to be escorted. The room appeared clean and tidy although more align to a standard room in contrast to the deluxe bay view promise. After checking in, we decided to go site seeing. We asked for the Concierge desk and were shockingly told that it was the handled by the doorman. I was then directed to go outside in the wind, where the doorman suggested I take out my smartphone and use that. REALLY??? That evening, we returned to find both Valet and self park were FULL. To their credit the front desk apologized and offered to comp our vallet for the remainder of our 3day stay. This would have been nice had we not found out upon checkout that we had been charged anyway. We then explained what events had led up to the front desk offer and were questioned as to who we spoke with and that no notes had been made on our account. After a brief investigation the charges were reversed. Sadly, we will not return to this hotel. Our daughter will be attending SF State in the fall and we were looking forward to many visits.

The mark up at a bar is generally validated by the social experience--the bar/restaurant here is just an expensive way to drink or eat alone.\r\n\r\nAesthetically, it doesn't really try.

The Embassy Suites, the Hilton Garden Inns, offer nicer accomodations and much better value. Westin charges $20 for parking. The others do not charge parking. I am an SPG member, but Westin would not credit my stay since I made the reservation through Expedia. Will never stay here again.

But the price was right on the weekend; it was good value (at least temporarily). [Note: I generally avoid hotels in the Starwood chain when traveling on business because I have been burned in the past by their 3 day advance notice cancellation policy at some of their hotels.

There's a nice walking/running path that starts across the street from the hotel and runs along the bay, and the hotel also has a small gym with a good variety of equipment. The restaurant and room service prices seemed a bit expensive, but there were a couple of restaurants within walking distance, and the staff had good recommendations for offsite eateries. I agree with other reviewers that charging for internet access in the lobby seemed excessive---I'm guessing that most people who stay here are on business, and probably travel with their laptop (and the hotel had internet access available in the rooms), but I've stayed in much less expensive hotels that offered internet access to their guests in the lobby or business center at no charge.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Seattle, WA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2006-10-13T05:41:36Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"4705","reviewId":"17730729","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Pat","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Can't wait to go back!","reviewText":"We found the hotel to be perfect for us.

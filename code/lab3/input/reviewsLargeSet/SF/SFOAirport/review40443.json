We took the top floor. When we got to the room, the carpet was wet, also the veneer was broken aroung the sink basin. The carpet had been cleaned,my partner slipped as she went into the bathroom, not realising that the carpet in the bedroom was wet. We asked for a room change & were given the ground floor room, That overlooked the Bay but the view was hidden behind the sea wall. That room also had a bathroom ceiling panel that was sagging, possibly due to dampness. Another main problem is the air conditioning -- WHATEVER you set the controller in the room to you get what reception has set. The room was warm when we arrived, so we set the air con to cool whilst we went out for a meal. When we arrived back the room was like an oven, the air con was pumping out hot air. When I went to reception the rather unconcerned agent said that because it was cool outside reception had set the air con to warm, so we had NO direct control over the room temperature. You do not need this when arriving at 10pm at night. The breakfast was quite good but with only 2 tables on the inside of the building - the others (about 4) were on the outside. Whilst waiting in the reception 2 other guests went to reception with complaints. In general the hotel looked tired and in desperate need of a face lift.

The computers in the lobby, which seem to date from around 1997, were surprisingly quick considering, but the printer had barely any ink, and didn't print the passes properly.  When I inquired about replacing the ink, the desk clerk replied they didn't have any more ink cartridges, and if they did, she didn't know where they were.  Again, you're kidding, RIGHT?!

We were not met with smiles or any show of friendliness whatsoever from the gal who checked us in. I asked for a quiet room and she put us right by the front desk, room 103. I was wondering how it would be quiet with the foot traffic of people going to the front desk area for breakfast, people parking around there to check in/out and it was near the street. It ended up being ok. Maybe it is quieter than being on the airport side. I was pleased with the breakfast and the running trail. If you go one direction all the way to the end and then do the same going the other direction from the hotel, you can get in a 3 mile walk/run. The view is very nice and you will see a lot of interesting birds etc. If you are planning on heading to Napa or up the coast at all, stay on the other side of San Francisco. We had to go through the city for all of our destinations which definately adds on travel time. The hotel provides healthy and not so healthy breakfast options. I opted for the oatmeal and fruit each morning. They also had sausage, scrambled eggs, potatoes, yogurt, cereal, juices, muffins, toast, bagels and waffles. We ate at the nearby Mexican restaurant (2 parking lots over) and it was very good. Finally, the cookies that the Vagabond serves at night are quite good.

Right next to the SFO Airport which not only makes for an easy trip to and from, but also makes for great view. Don't worry, it's not loud at all. The hotel is backed up to the bay which also has a great view and is very relaxing. There's a sidewalk that runs right behind it that leads from one end to the other and passe's through many nice restaurants etc. The room had a king bed which is great for 2 people unless someone doesn't mind sleeping on the floor. There would be space for 1-2 more that way. The bathroom is a little out dated, but still clean. The sink etc is located outside the room so if someone is trying to sleep, that maybe a disadvantage. The general layout of the hotel is nice. It has a more vacation feel like you're in a time share vs. just staying in a hotel. Rooms are easy to get to with elevators access. Vending machines are stocked. Parking is easy and close. With the parking permits they issue you, it keeps others from taking up space. Laundary is available too. I didn't eat breakfast there, but they did have a nice set up. It's not huge so if there are tons of people at the same time, that may be a problem, but looks comfortable. There are (3) waffle makers, tons of beverages, and all your standard stuff. Very clean and kept up. The lobby is relaxing to. Not a ton of traffice. Overall I would say it's a 4 or so. For the price, location, view, service, it's great.

All hotels in the area seem to jack up their rates for that week, and I'm guessing I paid more than twice the usual rate. The service was good, I found the people at the front desk to be very nice and willing to help/answer questions, etc. The room itself was just ok ... had a bay view, which was nice, but doors are open to the outside (so motel vs. hotel), which isn't my preference as being a woman traveling alone it felt sort of creepy coming in at night. The room was clean (no nasty rug stains, didn't smell like disinfectant), but the room and furniture were clearly old and not of the quality you'd find at, say, a Hampton Inn, where everything always feels updated. The free breakfast was good, do-it-yourself belgian waffles and the usual continental breakfast type stuff. Real close to the airport, which was fine except I had to travel to downtown via cab every day which ran between $45-$55 per ride one-way. I didn't try the two restaurants within walking distance because I didn't find them particularly appealing, would be nice if there were some more choices nearby. Would also have liked it if there were some sort of convenience store within walking distance. Overall, not a horrible place to stay, but if you're picky about appearances or don't like a place that feels \"old\", you probably won't like this place.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Baltimore, MD","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-10-11T19:44:18Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"hotelId":"40443","reviewId":"19355347","photos":[],"itinId":"338942775","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":1,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Richard","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Smelly, noisy, and hot, oh yeah...rude and definitely OVERPRICED.","reviewText":"If I had a check list on how NOT to run business \" The Vagabond Executive Inn San Francisco Airport\" would be a primer.

After the fact, I called the regional office and was advised to contact the manager. This proved even more frustrating because the manager took an incredibly aggressive defensive posture. She inferred that both my wife and myself had lied regarding the smell and air. Her rational was that they were always full therefore I must be full of beans. Well maybe the fact that they are located five minutes from the airport and can get away with the horrible overpriced accommodations on unsuspecting people like us might be what she was alluding to. Excuse me but where does the customer fit in her equation. I think this little tid bit of insight says it all. My wife and I were provided with two small bars of soap and no bath towels.

When we arrived we were picking up a car from SFO next morning so used the shuttle bus to and from the airport.Apart from about 1/2 hour wait this wasn't a problem. Check in took a wee while due 2 3 parties arr @ the same time. No worries though, the receptionist was very nice. After a very long flight we just wanted to chill out, I went down to ask about eating options, the receptionist recommended a local chinese and was kind enough to call them to fax a menu. She also rec'd The Elephant Bar next door. After a discussion we decided to try the Elephant! It was very busy but they have a booking system similar to F&B's in the UK with the flashing lights and we were soon shown 2 our table. 2 cut a long story short the food and service was A1 and we couldn't do it justice after a long flight. We went back on our last night and had a FAB meal!!! Back 2 the Hotel, Rooms seem 2 be hit and miss, 1st night was really spacious and clean but no view. Last night was smaller room and cigarette burns on furniture etc. but superb view of Bay.

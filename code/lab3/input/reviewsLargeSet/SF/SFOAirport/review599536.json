Morning, departure day: an odd power outage disabled only the restaurant (but not any other part of the hotel), so I could not even use the breakfast coupon!

We had stopped by that morning to drop off our luggage (too early to check in) and spend the day in San Francisco. It was nice that we could store our luggage even before we checked in, but when we finally did check in around 8pm, we had to wait 20 min or so for someone to retrieve our luggage because the staff were busy checking in other people. The guy who finally came to help us did apologize sincerely, but it was irritating after a long day.\n\nThe floor we stayed on was being renovated, so walls on every part of the hallway were down to the sheetrock with strips of old glue, so that wasn't what you would expect for the price. There were chocolates on the beds (one on each bed), which the kids were excited about, but when they unwrapped them, it was obvious that the chocolate was quite old, and it tasted stale.\n\nAll that said, the room was well insulated and clean, and we didn't hear any noises to bother us in the night.

The manager told my husband that someone from our party must be in our room and the deadbolt must be engaged. How can that be....we had just arrived! So a security guard accompanied him back to the room and put his key in to disengage the deadbolt. He then attempted to open the door but the security chain was engaged. He told us that someone must be in the room, so he called the front desk to verify whether or not the room was vacant. In the meantime, my husband went back to the front desk to request another room. Fortunately, there was another room available right next door. The security guard kept wondering aloud why no one from housekeeping was responding to his request to open the security chain lock system. We thought it was careless of the hotel to assign us a room that was apparently \"occupied,\" and we also thought it was unusual that whoever was in the room did not respond to our attempts to open/unlock the door.

It didn't really matter, though, since there were two others (one in the bathroom even!).\n\nIf you don't want to drive into the city, the main business area of the town Brisbane is just on the other side of the freeway, and has a few fast food restaurants as well as some local eats. We didn't try the restaurant in the hotel, since there were other, cheaper places so near.\n\nWe rented a car, and it proved to be a bit confusing getting around the various major roads, along with parking inside San Francisco, but we had a disabled man in our party, who was unable to take public transit.

It was a great meal to have before starting off the afternoon. Once we arrived into our room, within about 5 minutes of settling in and looking around, we received a call from the front desk to make sure everything was good. The hotel itself has several door notes indicating it is an \"eco-friendly\" hotel and that unless specified, will only clean every two days. So if you prefer having your room cleaned daily, then leave the note on the bed each day before you head out. We ended up getting a room with two queen beds, non smoking, bay view and it turned out to be just the resting place we were looking for.\n\nOverall, it was a clean and well kept hotel and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to explore San Fran but needs a nice bed to end off the day!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Edmonton, Alberta","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-07-15T00:54:09Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Families","categoryLabel":"Families"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"599536","reviewId":"18245551","photos":[],"itinId":"377154493","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":1,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Martin","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Excellent quality at a very decent price","reviewText":"We booked the slight upgrade ($10more) for the sleepnumber beds - very worth it.

Hotel was affordable and extremely comfortable. Rooms are huge and the heated pool and jacuzzi are indoors. It's about 10-12 minutes from Union Square, so long as you have a car there's no reason to stay closer to downtown. Location is very safe and clean, not crowded, no unsavory characters around whatsoever. Beautiful views, well decorated. We usually stay in the boutique hotels in the financial district or union square area, but from now on this will be our first choice, it was fantastic. We spent most of our time out of the room but it was so big and the jacuzzi was so nice that even staying in would have been very comfortable. Our room had fridge and microwave in it at no charge, but I don't know if that's true for all rooms.\n\nCons: There is a restaurant in the hotel, but the food is AWFUL. We had the lasagna (which is usually a safe bet, hard to mess up) and it was INEDIBLE. We had to order a pizza to the room, it was so disgusting. And we eat macaroni and cheese at home, so we're not very picky! Aside from the restaurant in the hotel, the closest food is about ten minutes away, so if you don't have a car that could be a problem. The only other issue was that the hotel advertised sleep number beds, which was a big selling point for us. When we got there they told us that only certain (more expensive) rooms had them. I complained & they did upgrade us for free, but beware if that is a big deal to you.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Chico, Ca","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-07-21T17:21:17Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"599536","reviewId":"18245497","photos":[],"itinId":"329255401","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Leslie","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Best bang for your buck!","reviewText":"Lovely hotel, suited our needs perfectly, traveled with our 3 kids, they loved the indoor heated pool and spa, experienced the sleep number bed, it was just ok...loved the fact that they had plenty of free parking, close fwy access, approx 10 min to downtown San Fran, would stay here again., Not much nearby but the rooms come with a mini fridge and a microwave, so dont forget to bring drinks and microwave popcorn!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Southern California","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-07-17T23:07:31Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Families","categoryLabel":"Families"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"599536","reviewId":"18245779","photos":[],"itinId":"322663267","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Cantik","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Feedback from a frequent customer","reviewText":"I called a few hours prior to my arrival and spoke to the front desk regarding my requests for room of my preference.

The hotel room was clean and fairly large, the staff was friendly and helpful. We couldn't ask for much more since we were only passing through. However, if you are planning to take in San Francisco on an extended stay, you would probably be better off staying in the touristy areas, since this hotel is a distance from the city. You can still drive into the city, but driving/parking is a nightmare.

Later we decided to go to the resteraunt to eat dinner and while in the elevator we noticed that you have to have your room key to access the 8th floor. So I decided to go to the font desk because this was bothering me. When I told the girl at the front desk our situation she corrected the problem and told me only the 8th floor was thier executive tower level just as I had thought. She was more than courtious and very appolagettic to us gave us free room service breakfast for the rest of our stay. Im not sure why that man did that but I am glad he did because we enjoyed room service because of it.

We called again to the front desk & they said that they can't send anyone right now cause it's too late, so they'll do it tomorrow... on the 3rd day we went early in the morning to the front desk & demand that they will solve the problem till we get back, they said \"don't worry\". Guess what? We came back & it was still freezing in the room... then they finally send technician who told us that he aware of the problem & there's no unit inside the AC, so that's the reason there's no heating... REALLY? So they gave another room, at the last day of our vacation, which the electricity didn't work there.

The only real complaint I had was on the first night we were in the hotel, I had a cold and was feeling terrible. My husband had to go out and search for a pharmacy to get me some medicine, and when he came back he stopped off at the hotel's restaurant to get me some soup. The restaurant closed at 10PM. When my husband arrived at the restaurant it was 10 minutes to 10PM and there were still quite a few people eating in the dining room and the cooks were still in the kitchen. When he asked for a soup to-go, he was told in a cold tone \"sorry kitchen closed\". As restaurant owners ourselves and being in the hospitality industry for a very long time, we always bend backwards for our customers and clients. This is a big hotel and I am pretty sure they could have reached into their walk-in fridge or from their stove and simply poured some soup into a to-go cup. When my husband got back to the room and told me the story I was not so happy. On top of that, we had three pillows and we both use 2 each. We looked around the room for an extra one and when we saw there weren't any, I suggested he call down to have someone bring us one, and my husband's reaction was \"yeah right - if I can't get any soup from an open restaurant, do you think they'll bring me a pillow?\".

The shuttle service follows the drivers schedule, not the one printed at the front desk. Some of the drivers are friendly, some aren't. I wouldn't say the shuttle is old, but it's quite rickety. The food in the hotel restaurant, Xebec, is good, unless they are understaffed and the owner goes on vacation. As with the shuttle, they follow their own schedule, not the published times. I would expect more of a resort type atmosphere for a hotel that is so inconvenient to get to. This hotel is good for corporate meetings and people wanting to rough it. Bring all the necessities with you because there are no convenient shops or services around. The free parking is good if you rent a car, but I recommend saving the extra $10 a day that you would spend on the BART to get into town from this hotel and spend it on a hotel downtown.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":1,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Honolulu, HI","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-01-03T04:21:02Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"60000","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"599536","reviewId":"18245647","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"","reviewText":"","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":true,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-01-02T20:34:02Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"599536","reviewId":"18245347","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Brigitte","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Nice Place to Stay","reviewText":"This hotel is modern, clean and comfortable.

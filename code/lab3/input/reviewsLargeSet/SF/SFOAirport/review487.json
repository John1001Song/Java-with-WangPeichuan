The room is just OK, the bathroom, closet, and sink area is very small and cramped. The wallpaper was peeling in spots, the paint was sloppily applied, the air vent was dirty. The mini fridge was pretty useless, our beverages were cool at best. I ended up throwing out some milk because it was so warm I didn't trust it. The customer service sucks, the nicest people there were the two cleaning ladies that did our floor everyday. Our TV remote didn't work and it took 3 calls to the front desk over the span of an hr and a half before someone finally came up with a new one. Since we were on a business trip we had a lot of computer gear, and since there are no in room safes we declined maid service. A few days in I had to call for a fresh set of towels, we waited at least 45mins for someone to bring them. The #1 complaint is the free wifi they boast about. It is so bad my husband hardly got any work done. We wanted to connect our ChromeCast to the TV for the bigger screen but the wifi was so bad it wouldn't even transfer the stuff from the laptop to the TV. It's honestly good for...not much. The attached restaurant is inconsistent.

First issue, the refrigerator did not work at all. We found that out by leaving drinks in the morning and came back in the evening with hot drinks. The next day, it was a little chilly and turned on the heater. Found out that did not work also. Both deficiencies were repaired. There was one front desk representative that gave us a free breakfast at Houlihan's for our troubles. That was very much appreciated. Throught out our stay in this hotel, there was always a very unpleasant smell in the hallways. The last day of our stay, it smelled like rotten fish by the elevator. The day we checked out, we were charged over $100 for parking. Parking? We never had stayed in a hotel or motel that required to pay for parking. The front desk representative pointed out to us that there were parking by the front of the hotel.

In that time, staff only cleaned the room once. We called and asked for fresh towels since they had not touched the room, and they sent up 1. There were 4 people in the hotel room. We then had an issue with the TV and called maintenance. It took maintenance 1 hour and 2 phone calls to show up. When they came, he only changed the remote and said he'd come back in 5 minutes to fix the rest. We waited awake for an additional hour and he never came back. When we called the front desk to complain, he was rude and very unhelpful. They didn't even offer to switch our room to a working TV. The ice machine on our floor was broken, the elevator was very fussy- sometimes needing a room key to switch floors, other times not, and there was no breakfast or free parking. Just when we thought the hotel was positively awful, we met Joey, the guest manager and complained. He was SO apologetic and unbelievably nice. He took off the extra charges to our room for parking and could not apologize enough. I wouldn't stay at this hotel or recommend it to anyone, but if you must stay, make sure Joey still works there to fix the mess the rest of the employees and services create.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":1,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-07-16T19:53:35Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Other","categoryLabel":""}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"487","reviewId":"20217925","photos":[],"itinId":"374595070","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Lana","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Was there for a conference and it met all my needs","reviewText":"My daughter was there for a conference and my grandson and I came along.

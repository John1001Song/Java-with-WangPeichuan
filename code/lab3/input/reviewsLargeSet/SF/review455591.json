It came off as kind of rude but I know he didnt intend that. Room was excellent and clean, quiet too. It was advertised at $100 adn totaled around $113 after tax. There's one computer to use for business purposes. I was looking online at other hotels and for $115 I could have stayed at The Westin airport hotel. You can never go wrong with a Westin and I regret not booking with them. The shuttles only came once an hour, which is not efficient especially when you have people needing to catch a flight. I came downstairs in the morning and he said the shuttle was already gone. I wasnt late either so why was it not there waiting? I ended up taking Uber that got lost trying to find my destination to my interview and didnt make it on time, so my trip was a complete waste. Atleast the Westin has shuttles coming every 15-20. At checkout me and another guest were waiting about 10 minutes for someone to come to the front. How can you run a business with no one there to run it???

There was also OJ, apple juice and plenty of fresh, hot brewed coffee, regular & decaf.  No need to go ANYWHERE for breakfast!  Also, in the sitting room, there is a computer for printing out your boarding pass.  Convenient!  The decor could use some updating, but it didn't affect my 3-night stay there.  In the room, there was cable TV, WiFi, a microwave, small fridge and plenty of hot water (good pressure too).  The best part of my stay without question?  THE BED!  OMG...my double bed was so comfortable, it felt like I was sleeping on a cloud.  Seriously!  I am used to an extra firm bed for my back, but once I got in the bed, it just surrounded me in softness and within minutes, I was OUT!

I gave the manager the list when we checked out so that his staff could take care of it before the next guest's arrival. I felt that those issues should have been monitored by the cleaning staff. They should have been aware of these when they were cleaning the room.\n\nThey should shampoo or steam clean the carpet on a regular basis. I was walking around in my white socks on the first day and they were \"blacken\" at the bottom when I removed them. Fortunately, I packed my slippers so only 1 pair of socks got the worst of it and I washed my slippers before re-packing them. Also, a few days later, my wife misplaced her ring on the new room and I was on my hands and knees looking for it.

The breakfast buffet is minimal with no eggs or sausage, something that was available in the three other hotels we stayed during our recent trip to California. The good points is that is about 1.5 miles away from the Millbrae BART and CalTrain station which is a very convient way to get into San Francisco as we did the one night we stayed there to see a SF Giants game.

Beds are comfortable and TV (and other electrical items) worked well. Rooms come standard with microwave oven and mini-fridge which is helpful as there are several excellent restaurants [Patio Filipino and Mi Tequila] in the area (leftovers) as well as a few convenience stores with grocery items. The Tanforan Mall (small, but it has most of the staples) is only a short bus trip away (San Bruno BART and Sam Trans bus terminal is also at one end of the mall) and there is a Kohls, Walgreens, and Office Depot all within walking distance. The hotel also offers a van shuttle that can pick you up and/or drop you off at SFO. In my opinion, this is the best of the Days Inn hotels in the San Francisco area. The BART trip into San Francisco proper only takes about an half hour and is amazingly inexpensive.

We booked a room at this Days Inn through Expedia, so we could take advantage of the airport shuttle.\n\nI called the hotel several days before arrival to ask if I could park my car there for a week while we were away. It turns out there is a \"park and fly\" special that would have been a really good deal. It was too late to book that (we'd paid for the room already), but they gave us a decent daily parking rate.\n\nThe hotel is easy to find. Parking is inconvenient -- there is no direct access to the hotel lobby from the parking lot. Overall, the place is worn and run down. The doors were severely scuffed by luggage and the carpet is balding. But the room was clean-ish, and the bed was comfortable. The blanket was a little yucky.\n\nThe walls are quite thin; we could hear conversation-level voices from the adjacent rooms but we couldn't really make out the words.\n\nThe SFO shuttle runs hourly. We took the 6:10 AM shuttle for a 7:35 AM flight and made it in plenty of time, even with a stop at the ticket counter. The shuttle's last departure from the airport is 12:30am. We just missed it and had to pay $15 + tip for a cab ride.\n\nDespite the dinginess we felt like we got a good deal and an extra 2 hours of sleep.

The 3rd night of my stay, I returned to my room late in the evening to find that the cleaning staff had not cleaned the room as I had requested, instead making up the bed with the same sheets and the bathroom floor dirty. What really got my goat was was when I realized that someone had opened and eaten some of the snack food that I had purchased and left in my room. I did go immediately to the front desk to and was told that when the manager returned the next day, he would replace the snack food that had been eaten. What a mess. Do you really think that eating the snack food was as important as the fact that I felt violated and did not know whether my possessions had been sifted through??? I quickly made other arrangements for the remainder of my stay.

The desk told me that I did not, although this information was on the confirmation I signed when I arrived. When at 7:30 I asked for the bed, she told me she couldn't have it until 10:30 p.m. She did end up getting a crib to me, but without the slats. The child ended up sleeping on the mattress on the floor, but the desk's response to my requests (you didn't request it, I can't do it, here's something inadequate and unsafe) was totally inappropriate. -We saw the same desk person at the desk for over 24 hours. We were very uncomfortable with this arrangement. It also seemed that, although friendly, she had not been fully trained in customer service (did not repeat our requests to us to confirm, did not confirm requests with a definite yes or no, made excuses rather than solved problems). -When we asked for a bus or train schedule, she said they had no schedules.

The appliances were in good condition and clean. The king sized bed had a generic mattress and was stiff and unforgiving, especially after my 3 hour drive and rush to the airport. The television was an old fashion tube but had good picture, sound and plenty of clear channels to choose from - and the remote worked! The desk clerk could not give directions to the hotel over the phone from the nearest freeway (101) so I was wandering around El Camino Real for 5 minutes longer than necessary ( take the San Bruno exit if going Northbound). She was helpful in calling their cab service (free to guests going to/from SFO) prior to my arrival. The cab ride is about 10 mins long to SFO. Make sure to call them from the Arrivals Taxi line - or you may miss the cab to come back - or give your cell# so the cab can call to find you. The continental breakfast is minimal - coffee, Danish, cold cereal, banana, juice and waffles - not enough to sustain you on your flight or drive home - but not bad for the price of the hotel. Overall: I would use them again for turn-around trips. If they had extended and covered parking for park&fly I would put them at the top of my list.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Fresno, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-06-25T06:20:50Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"455591","reviewId":"17303761","photos":[],"itinId":"268445911","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Judy","brandType":"Expedia","title":"good for the price","reviewText":"Easy access to bus service, not far from restaurants and BART system.

Bathroom extremely small.  Did have a/c and heat, but temp hard to control.  Throughout San Francisco, windows and doors are often left open for ventilation.  Without our knowledge, our room window was open the first night, making it very noisy.  Shutting the windows  helped a lot with noise, but the hotel is located on a busy street, so traffic could still be heard.  From reviews I read before choosing the Opal, hotel rooms are small and expensive in SF, so I would rate it as a good value for the room rate we paid. All of the staff that we encountered were very friendly.   Marnie and Claudia at the front desk were extremely helpful and accomodating.  \r\n\r\nFood- Limited Continental breakfast included and served at 6:00.   Fruit, cereal, boiled eggs, muffins, and toaster items, such as bagels, waffles, and English muffins.  Mel's Diner is attached and has extensive hours, but we found it to be expensive for the type and quality of food served.  Tommy's Joynt, which is just across the street, is a bar and restaurant, which looks unimpressive from outside, but the food was wonderful! The plate lunch ($12.88) is generous portions and was delicious!!!  (Corned beef, smoked brisket and turkey) Wish we had tried it earlier instead of Mel's when we needed to eat dinner near the hotel.  \r\n\r\nThe MUNI bus stops at the corner very near the hotel, which goes to Fisherman\"s Wharf for about $1.00 one way.

The carpet looked pretty old. The room was adequate but on the corner of two busy streets so it was noisy (at least with the windows up).

If you are visiting San Francisco for the first time and have the intentions of spending majority of your time, and only need a place to clean up and sleep without any real luxuries- this is the place for you. If you are the type to spend a good amount of time lounging in your room as well as out, you may want to consider another choice. For the price you will pay, it's about the best option there is. A few things to know about first time goers: You will be staying in the Civic Center area- meaning if your intent is to spend most of your time on the warf then you will be either walking for the better part of 45 minutes or public transit. This would not be so bad if it were not for the over population of homeless in the area- so good chances are that you will be sitting next to some interesting \"characters\". Would I stay there again? Yes, if I was trying to save money and only needed the bare necessities: SMALL bathroom, bed, tv stand ( which you can touch easily from laying in your bed), and desk.

No business center. No pool - unless I missed it. Gym is very small and poorly equipped. Even the cleaning personnel is unfriendly and does not say \"hello\" back. The front desk is pretty much useless. I asked for a car charger, which they did not have. I also called the front desk and they frequently don't pick up or take too long to answer. I asked for a wake up call, which was not made nor has anyone come to knock on the room door. My overall impression is that this hotel was a very poor quality hotel that charged a lot of money for the location close to downtown. They even charge an extra 46 dollars a night if you actually need to park your car. There is nothing, but meters around the hotel, so parking is scarce. I also noticed there was a continental breakfast, but you'd probably save a bundle staying somewhere else and get a nice breakfast in a restaurant instead of this packaged deal. Overall, you would expect more for a hotel in downtown with an asking price as high as it was. Besides, SF is not exactly NYC to warrant such rates. You could get a better deal for a cheaper.

Being a group of young 18 year olds, we were looking for somewhere cheap, but of course we didn't want to be getting some shack in the ditch. The Opal exceeded all of our expectations. Check in was a breeze, parking was much cheaper after the clerk led us to a parking garage down the street (keep in mind there are no in/out privileges for this one), and breakfast was perfect. It's not a 5-star meal, but it's nothing unbearable. The room was very clean, big enough for the 4 of us, and the bathroom was bigger than we expected. The hotel lobby was always comfortable and tidy, and the doors to get inside were only opened with a room key which made our stay feel even safer. As for the location, if you want to stay somewhere less sketchy, get the hell out of San Francisco b/c everywhere you go in the heart of a city is going to be \"sketchy\". Our stay was everything we could have imagined and more, with absolutely no troubles or complaints to leave behind.

The kids even said they felt it was one of the better hotels we've stayed in. The location made it easy to traverse to all the tourist spots we had on our agenda and the staff were very helpful. The breakfast room did leave a bit for wanting, It's a small room for the amount of guest the hotel supports and was crowded pretty much all the time. We tried breakfast at different hours each day trying to find a less crowded dinning time and were not successful. However there are many coffee shops in the area in walking distance. Though we didn't have any problems checking in the family before us did and the hotel staff quickly found a solution for their stay in a calm and controlled manor.  The bathroom of our room was a bit lacking in counter space but we all came prepared with our travel bags and made it work, just like in the dorms or the gym.

We were there for business so not a big deal.  Other decent hotels in the area were going for $300-$400 a night.

The positives were the free continental breakfast, free wifi, and the wine and cheese tasting they had on Wednesday.  The hotel was also very close to many good restaurants.

The bathroom door is parallel to the bed 3 ft away & opens to face the toilet. I prefer a bit more acoustical insulation & privacy when having a romantic trip..\r\n- Paid a deposit to the hotel (half the overall commute cost) to have a van service deliver us to the airport. The van was very late and we were then told it was a non-refundable deposit & a separate company from the hotel so they held no responsibility. Shady. \r\n- Food was no satisfactory but we eat very healthy. The fruit tasted like there was sugar all over it. The yogurt had a lot of unnecessary ingredients, (I'm gluten free so did not eat the bagels, toast, muffins).\r\n\r\nThe Pros: \r\n- Great location for those that like to walk. Central to Golden Gate Park, Fisherman's Wharf, Chinatown, etc. Also on a main road so it's easy to take a bus to the door of The Opal. \r\n- The room was very spacious and clean. There was a tv and heating/cooling system we could control.

I have stayed at the Opal over the years and love it.\nYet, I am saddened by management's recent decision to remove boiled eggs from the breakfast menu, and hence a main source of protein.\n\nThe only other material area to be improved would be having a refrigerator, particularly in the more expensive rooms. I would like to have cooled juices such as carrot, etc. not available for the three and half hour morning buffet. It would be a matter of convenience to be able to keep food/snacks/drinks in refrigerator rather than using the bathroom window sill hoping it remains cold enough. Obviously, in summer this does not work. There is no convenient organic health food store nearby, so I express this concern. I often travel to the Haight for such, and there is a Trader Joe's up Geary (on the 38 bus) and Masonic stop to the right. Yet again, it would be nice not to have to shop everyday for one's drink, other than tap water of course. There is ice available, but it is not sufficient to keep food or a large juice container cool for the next day.\n\nGiven the above two, I would go with the return of boiled eggs.

The hotel is on the edge of the Tenderloin which is seedy and populated by bums (there are bums everywhere in San Fran though) However the hotel feels very safe and the street it's on, Van Ness, is large and not seedy. Van Ness is a kind of divider between the tenderloin and another neighborhood and the location was actually quite good. It's 5 blocks from the Asian art museum and convenient to Polk which has a lot of good restaurants. There is a restaurant, Mel's Diner, which is in the hotel block and provides room service. Breakfast was toast, yogurt, fruit, boiled eggs, muffins and coffee. Across the street is a popular restaurant called Tommy's Joynt which serves large, cheap hunks-o-meat meals cafeteria style and is also historic (since 1947) and seemingly fairly unchanged. I'm a vegetarian so neither place appealed to me much but veggie options are everywhere in San Francisco. Up Van Ness is a good sushi place with 99 cent Sapporo drafts.

They also gave us a complementary bottle of wine when they found out we were on our honeymoon. We stayed in a deluxe king size room, it was nothing extraordinary but it had all the basics, which is what we needed since we were out touring the city most of the time anyways. I had no complaints on the bed and pillows, they were average and I slept just fine. The room was very clean. The complementary breakfast isn't as bad as some reviewers make it sound, they had bagels, different kinds of bread/toast, a few different kinds of muffins, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, and juice/coffee. Again, it was nothing extraordinary, but definitely good enough for a quick breakfast. The route 47 bus is right outside the hotel, which takes you to the Fisherman's Warf area, and has stops near the cable car routes as well.

Because we know what to expect in an old hotel in San Francisco, we were not expecting granite counters in the bathrooms and gigantic closets, or even a large room. We were surprised at the spaciousness of our room, which was described as a mini-suite. The bathroom was very small, as expected. When the owners upgrade next time, they should put in curved shower curtains so there is a little more room in the tub during showering. Our party consisted of three adults, and we had two queen beds which was fine. The biggest challenge was getting ready for a wedding the next day; with two women using the bathroom to get ready it was a little inconvenient. The lighting inside the room could have been better and so a person could use a mirror outside the bathroom for makeup etc. quite easily. And ironing a pair of black slacks in the dim room was difficult--I had to keep walking to a better lit area to see how I was doing. But the price was excellent. We didn't make it down in time for the breakfast. There were a lot of European travelers staying while we were there--the hotel must be on someone's list.

It is a central location for travelers on a budget who would prefer to be near everything without having to stay in a distant motel or a seedy rooming house. It is not a sleek, modern hotel nor is it the Four Seasons. However, for the money it works just fine for those who know where they are going in SFO and simply don't want to break their budget. I rented a family suite that slept 2 grown-ups and 3 teenagers comfortably. The continental breakfast is complimentary and really helps the wallet. The hotel is on busy Van Ness Avenue and just 3 blocks from the California St. Cable Car stop. It is also just a 20-30 minute walk to the Wharf or the Financial district.\nIt should be noted that some of the side streets near the hotel appear a little spooky at night with street characters looming in the shadows. Just know your surroundings and have your street smarts on alert and you will have no problems. The hotel wanted $35 a night to park (and a large refundable deposit for the garage door remote). I found a better option 2 blocks away for $22 a night, but carefully read the hourly rate sign and understand the hours of operation.\nPerhaps most importantly, the staff at the Opal were just great to us. They were cheerful and most helpful with our various requests. We would stay there again without any hesitation.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Southern New Jersey","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-11-14T17:15:02Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"919198","reviewId":"34859146","photos":[],"itinId":"394421374","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Surprisingly great","reviewText":"You can't beat the service here.

While daytime walking through the Tenderloin is probably safe, it is definitely not a safe area to walk in the evening. That said, the hotel is well priced for the location, which is about ten long walking blocks to Union Square. The rooms are adequate though not updated. The staff acts rather casually to complaints and requests, including courtesy at check-in. It appears that many foreign visitors and some groups utilize the hotel which may account for this attitude of complacency. The breakfast seems to have improved since comments made by others. While lacking yogurt and cereal, it's certainly an acceptable continental-style breakfast. Our only major complaint was that we were given a room in the \"motel-like\"portion of the hotel. When we asked why, we were told that rooms were given out in the order of check-in. Though the room was what we requested and it was quiet for the most part, we had to walk out of the hotel and around the inside parking lot to get to the room. This wasn't a great inconvenience for the two nights we stayed there, but the explanation seemed inadequate to us. Some travelers could be upset by this development. We were offered the chance to change rooms for the second night, but did not want to move our items for the one remaining night. Overall, this is an acceptable hotel as long as you don't pay the posted prices.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Austin, TX","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-05-29T15:42:48Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"919198","reviewId":"17672307","photos":[],"itinId":"369459721","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Harvey","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Was very much what we wanted at a decent price.","reviewText":"Very nice \"Boutiquey\" Hotel.

Reviews of the hotel stated that it was close to everything. However, it should have said was that it was in the middle of everything, but close to nothing. The neighborhood is dicey and the sounds of sirens are frequent. However, that wouldn't have been a problem if it weren't for the way we were treated by the front desk staff when we later had a problem with our room. On Saturday we headed out into the city to see the sights and returned late in the afternoon to find that our room hadn't been changed over. We approached the front desk about our situation and were told it MUST have had a 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door. (I am not a fan of those in customer service who insist on suggesting that any problem you may have with their service is entirely your own fault). I assured him that this was not the case and he assured me that he would take care of the problem. When we returned later from dinner our room was still unchanged. Furthermore, when I asked the front desk clerk for towels so that we could at least take a shower with fresh towels before seeing the show, the man at the desk became rude and said that he would take care of it. We never did receive our towels. I have read that the staff at this hotel is courteous and helpful, however, if you stay there just pray that everything goes smoothly, or you may find the front desk staff rudely blaming the whole thing on you.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":1,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":1,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Rohnert Park, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-10-15T09:08:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"919198","reviewId":"17672282","photos":[],"itinId":"290199582","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"celso","brandType":"Expedia","title":"The Hotel has met my needs.","reviewText":"As I went to a business travel the Hotel met my needs.It is located in a excellent place with easy access to the downtown and near San Francisco\"s sightseeings.As I was out all day, I used it only for breakfast and sleep.The breakfast and accommodations are good.The Hotel is nice and well kept.I\"ll come back again.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"S√£o paulo, SP, Brazil","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-09-27T17:08:59Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"919198","reviewId":"17672237","photos":[],"itinId":"288932514","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Valerie","brandType":"Expedia","title":"good place","reviewText":"The room was very clean.

The hotel is clean, in good condition, and the staff are incredibly courteous and professional. I did not find a single problem as far as cleanliness goes. The room was very nicely kept and the cleaning staff were friendly. The front desk staff were pretty knowledgeable and helpful on top of that. One day I asked for a map and the guy asked where we were going. When I told him, he suggested a different route to avoid an INCREDIBLY steep hill, for which I was grateful.

Van Ness is US 101, a wide boulevard lined with shops, restaurants, bars and the occassional hotel. We chose this one because we had read bad things about the Civic Center area regarding it being dead at night with nothing but homeless people, so this was the other reasonably-priced alternative. This turned out to be true, as we saw later. Although not on a BART, streetcar or MUNI rail line, there are several buses that go to points of interest. The room was smaller than I had anticipated, but the high-speed internet (wired) was really nice, the full cable TV (but no pay stations) was also appreciated. Complaints: - The small bathroom was a little annoying, as you couldn't really lean into the sink. - The maid stopped filling the towels for a couple of days (she left clean ones, but not as many as we had had before), although she may have been mad after my friend broke a hotel glass in the bathroom. - This is an old building, so the layout is pretty quirky, with two elevators and stairwells in strange places. The room was also a bit drafty. - The free breakfast, although good, was set up in a tiny room off of the lobby and was packed after about 8am. - Our room was next to the fire escape. It was a little too cold to enjoy it, and it blocked what otherwise would have been a nice view of the busy street corner.

Luckily, having small children I always plan to have a lot of time for everything I do. Had I been in a rush, it would have been a problem.

My only criticism if at all was the buffet breakfast. 6 til 10am. We arrived at 0930 and it was chaos!. The staff were all over place trying to clear things away. Reluctant to serve us, served us the wrong drinks, little or no food available( still got the bill though!!). no cutlery or crockery. It was a shambles to be honest. Maybe just that day I couldn't tell you. The last three days we got breakfast out on our way to the city.

Long story short, it was crazy busy, but this might have been because it was also running a promotional discount and was the cheapest hotel I could find close to the airport. Anyway, so I get to the front desk after having booked with Expedia and the guy at the check in desk tries to look me up...\n\n\"Sorry, I don't have your reservation.\", he says. So there I am, sick as a dog, in a loud lobby, fumbling around with my cell phone to try to prove to him that, yes, I did reserve this hotel. Does he go out of his way to look at the printed reservations, no? Meanwhile, I'm standing there just waiting for him to figure his stuff out, fumbling on my phone, showing him the receipt, and other front desk people are going out of the way to welcome guests. Doubletree does this thing where they hand you a warmed cookie on check-in - now I don't need a cookie, but I am hungry. And, five minutes go I'm still standing there with a somewhat standoffish guy telling me he doesn't know anything about my reservation...\n\n...he goes to check the printer in a cursory manner.

Our server/bartender was very attentive and the food was wonderful--very fresh and cooked to order. We couldn't have been happier with the quality and service. The next morning, we ate breakfast in the restaurant and again, the service was very attentive and pleasant. I thought the breakfast buffet was very good--an excellent assortment of items. My husband ordered the Eggs Benedict and raved about it. My only negative comment was the room was a bit dusty around the baseboards (no one else noticed it but me, but then again, I look for this stuff#, and the beds were quite small for my husband and me #and we're not big people), but we were definitely crowded.

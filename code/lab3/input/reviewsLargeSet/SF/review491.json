Although conveniently located, it does not offer the services of a major urban hotel. I was shocked in the morning when I couldn't find a room service menu in the room, and was told they don't offer room service. When I went down to the restaurant (more of a rinky-dink cafe behind the larger lounge), I was told they only offered a buffet -- even on a weekday -- and had no menu one could order from. I am not a big breakfast eater, and buffets are not a good deal for me, so I had to wander down the street to find someplace to have breakfast before an important business meeting -- not what I expect at a major downtown hotel in a big city. Also, when I came back to my room that evening about 7 pm, they had a musical group in the lounge, which is right off of and open to the lobby, playing extremely loudly. They were so loud it was hard to speak to the concierge or front desk staff without shouting. This was not a problem in my room, which was on the 11th floor, but just an annoyance to have that much noise in the lobby. Some parents with children rushed their kids out of the lobby into the elevators with the kids holding their ears. Also, in the business center, access to the internet is pay-per-minute, at $7 per 15 mins, and copies were $1 per copy. On the whole, pretty chintzy and money-grubbing for a hotel with room rates $200-300+. I will not go back.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"LA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-09-03T21:48:25Z","roomTypeId":200541735,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":true,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"491","reviewId":"57c6d4a7624dfb0b51624adc","photos":[],"itinId":"1143445340152","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Nice hotel close to everything ","reviewText":"Very nice,transportation was excellent next to everything wish had more time to see more San Francisco ","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"san fransisco","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-08-31T12:59:19Z","roomTypeId":200541735,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":true,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":2,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":2,"hotelId":"491","reviewId":"57c50b1710b6f10b84044e27","photos":[],"itinId":"1144093035048","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"AJAY","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Nice Hotel Best Location","reviewText":"If you are going first time to San Francisco, and you are ready to pay 300 USD per night, I am sure you cannot find a better place to live.

The rooms are spacious and clean, but be prepared that this is not a luxury hotel along the likes of a Ritz, St. Regis or Four Seasons.   This is much more of a standard, business-type hotel. The rooms are appointed with very basic, minimal furnishings and decor (really, there is no decor).  No mini-bar, no room service -- but we did ask for and receive a refrigerator for no charge.  The bathrooms are small, somewhat dated and do not have double sinks (also only a tub with a shower curtain as opposed to stall shower), though they were clean.  The daily fee for internet service is annoying, as is the fact that every 24 hours we had to re-enter our request to access it.  At these rates, the internet should just be included.

Certainly was not expecting such a response.. it seems like the kettle is available only on a first come first serve basis. And, I would have to spend my time, waiting for someone to check then deliver. \r\nOn top of the booking fees and taxes, there is also a mandatory resort fee that is charged for every night stayed. This figure is also taxable. What does this mandatory fee cover? Only one or maybe two items that I will require - Internet access and the gym. I can probably do without the gym.

It was a short walk to the Powell Street cable car and there was a bus/street trolley station less than a block away.  Getting around town is very easy. We purchased a 3 day Metro pass which can be used on cable cars, buses and the electric trolley cars.\r\n\r\nWe took the BART train from SFO airport to the hotel and that was a breeze. (I recommend buying your R/T voucher online ahead of time so you can skip the ticket line at the airport.) The station was just a block from the hotel. I can't imagine the need for renting a car unless you plan to head far out of the city. While checking in we asked if we could upgrade to a room on a higher floor. They happily obliged and upgraded us without any additional charge.  We had a corner room on the 14th floor which made looking out of the floor to ceiling windows even more spectacular. The only negative comment I would have is the street noise.  San Franciscan drivers clearly love using their car horns.

When you look on expedia the hotel looks like a great price for a city center hotel. However at check-in you have to pay an extra 30 dollars a day \"resort fee\". This is an outrageous bait and switch on headline pricing. This fee (according to expedia) covers internet, however my experience was wifi in the room was still 24.95 extra a night (per device connected!!!) - I refused to pay this and used the hotspot feature on my phone quite happily.\r\n\r\nIn addition parking was 66.95 per day! That is also outrageous (although I did use it). I noticed on my second day that directly opposite the hotel is a parking structure which is likely a lot cheaper (turn right down a small street immediately after driving past the hotel lobby)\r\n\r\nThe shop is nice but 3.49 for a bottle of coke is too high.

Great location, photos seemed nice and the price seemed about right for what I was getting (despite the hidden \"resort\" fee).\r\n\r\nWhen I got there the staff seemed friendly enough, no complaints there. The room was a little tighter than I expected but that was fine considering the location. \r\n\r\nThe biggest issue I had was the thin walls, every sound, creak, voice and bump could be heard as if it was in the same room. I don't know where they were but I could hear someone constantly vomiting or something very loudly at about 2am and it sounded like it was in my bathroom. When that subsided all I could here was creaking framework and I had to put some music on to get some sleep, which I'm not used to doing.\r\n\r\nI could have looked past this but when I checked out they told me I needed to pay an extra $30 per night for some reason, I though I had already paid this as a \"resort fee\" but apparently it was something different. I was too jet lagged and tired to care so I just went with it. I asked how long it would take for my bond to be returned to my card and they said 4 days! As I was travelling, this was part of my spending money. I wasn't warned at all of the amount of time it would take when I checked in, and the attitude of the staff seemed a lot different like I should have known all this.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't consider this a quality hotel at all.

My room was directly above it, and laying in bed at night could hear the rhythmic thumping of people running on treadmill on the floor beneath me. \r\n\r\nFront desk staff not particularly friendly or helpful when contacted a few times from roll phone. No apparent sign of available room service or menu. Had to manually check out on morning of last day, no bill waiting for me under door that morning, as is customary most places.

Once they finally did, I told them the room only had a Queen bed and I had paid for a King. They said someone will be up with keys to another room and hung on me again.

The drain plug of the shower was ripped out and hanging on the bottom of the shower, which did not have a light and was quite dark while inside\r\n2.  Due to the triangular shape of the room, when closing the bathroom door from fully open to closed, it would get stuck on the bathroom counter (made contact with the counter about halfway through and required some force to continue swinging shut)\r\n3. The toilet was inches away from the shower and blocked about half of it making it tough to get in and out\r\n4. There were no outlets on the left bedside table or below.  The outlet on the right was very close to the ground and hard to access as it was under the table.  The only other outlets were across the room\r\n5.

It did not come with a chair and ottoman that the pictures show, so no sitting room. The bed however was delightfully comfortable.  The location is great.  Walking distance to ATT park, Union Square, and embarcadero. They allowed us a late check out, which was quite nice with a little one.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the lack of stars in my review is that the bathrooms were not cleaned upon our arrival!  The toilet was disgusting,  and hair in the bathtub.  Every hotel folds the corners of the toilet paper to show they at least looked at the bathroom and this was not done here, so I know it was untouched. \r\n\r\nI thought the man who checked us in could have been more friendly.  He certainly was to the well dressed couple in front of me. I was traveling with my family and tending to my infant son, so I'm sure I did not look my best, still no reason to treat people differently.  You never know a person's background.\r\n\r\nI couldn't tell you about the hotels facilities.  I felt uninspired to go to the gym after the person checking me in said \"the gym is on such and such floor, but I'm sure you won't be going.\" Again, quick to pre-judge. I went for a jog outside instead.

We paid extra for an upgrade which we thought was worth it when we got to our room as we were on the 28th floor with great views.\nUnfortunately we discovered that our 'upgrade' meant we were right next to the elevator shaft so we heard it loud and clear all night. The walls were so thin that we could hear people going to the bathroom and showering.\n\nThe breakfast was probably the worst buffet I've had in years- I can't understand why a 4 star hotel would make scrambled 'eggs' from dehydrated powder. With credit to the check out staff, they took it off our bill when we said something.\n\nThe entertainment system is old and outdated. Most 4 and 5 star hotels these days allow you to purchase a 24 hour pass so you can watch as many movies as you like as opposed to paying for individual fils. The new movies at the Westin cost $18 which is more than most people pay at the cinema. Also, you're only able to pause and fast forward for a small period of time.\n\nAll in all, it felt like The Westin has a way to go before really competing with other 4 star hotels in the area. It's ok but it's just not getting the finer details right that take your stay from ok to fantastic.\n\nI wouldn't recommend it to anyone as I know that your money can go a lot further in so many other well known hotel brands in the area.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Los Angeles","reviewSubmissionTime":"2014-03-24T17:45:30Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Ellie","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"3","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_gb","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"491","reviewId":"67906117","photos":[],"itinId":"15697639645","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[{"isFlaggable":false,"userNickname":"Debey","displayLocale":"en_GB","date":"2014-10-04T09:06:59Z","id":"605106","response":"Thank you OS for reviewing your stay with us and sharing your experience with others.

When we walked around to the front entrance, the night desk person did not even know an alarm had been tripped! Where were the guards at the entrance to the hotel? Who allowed this to happen?\nThe second night, in the room next to mine, it sounded like there were at least ten people in there and they proceeded to play a game that began at 11pm and lasted till 5am, which consisted of running in and out of their room over and over, running up and down the halls yelling and screaming and running up and down the fire escapes. I called to complain once, but it changed nothing.\nThe third night, I asked to be moved to a different floor since my neighbors were staying a second night. The staff was very sympathetic and made the move right away.\nThe Westin is an enormous hotel and I don't feel like it is under very good control. The kinds of behaviors I have described would never be tolerated by a smaller hotel, paying essentially the same price.\nOne very nice thing is that the rooms were extremely comfortable with comfy beds and pillows.

We had a beautiful city view, all the way to Alcatraz Island and the Bay Bridge in the distance. The room was spacious by SF standards and the bed linens were 100% cotton and very fresh. Although we could hear the elevator, the hotel provides a white noise machine that masked the sound just fine. We probably could have switched rooms if the sound bothered us, but we didn't want to give up our view!\nFrom the hotel, we were able to walk to Yerba Buena Gardens, which has a children's museum as well as other attractions. Many restaurants and museums are within walking distance.\nThe 12:00 check out time was really convenient for us as we needed to take care of a business matter in the city prior to our departure.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"San Jose, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2013-08-12T16:43:45Z","roomTypeId":53,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"491","reviewId":"56044373","photos":[],"itinId":"160121142404","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Front desk was great.

I started to investigate where the aroma was coming from and realized the rim of the base of the toilet had a streak of feces. I immediately called housekeeping and reported the smell and what I noticed. They send housekeeping to the room to clean it but knowing this completely upset me and made me disgusted with the hotel. For this reason, I do not recommend this hotel. If u don't care for cleanliness and only concern urself with location then this is a good hotel cause of location. Market street is the best location for hotel stay cause all the stores, restaurants and etc are located there plus transportion. You will find the cable car, bus, trolley and other transportation stop on the market st strip leading u all over San Francisco. If you decide to go to Westin wish u a better experience stay there. As for me, no more stays at the westin not at San Francisco or anywhere. This is not my first time staying at a Westin hotel... Didn't like it in Ny and the one in San Francisco. In both hotel found it to be filthy. Courtyard Marriott is cleaner and nicer furniture for less. Don't believe me check them out yourselve and you will see. It's truly ashame...

I hope they were charged for the difference in the rooms so the hotel made money because I can't understand otherwise why the hotel would not give me a room that I booked. I don't work in the hotel industry so I don't know what the reasons or procedures are, I'm just annoyed I didn't get the room I paid for. They supposedly made up for it by giving is a 'deluxe' queen room but there wasn't anything deluxe about it but the fact that it was on a higher floor with a bad view. We couldn't really unpack because I wanted my king bed that I paid for so we moved rooms the next day. They have us a higher floor again to make up for the previous night but the bathroom mirror hasn't been cleaned properly because the previous guest got toothpaste residue all over the bottom of the mirror and I could still see it everywhere.

The room was initially very warm, and after running for 3 hours the air conditioner would not bring the temperature below 74 degrees. I called housekeeping, and to their credit, they sent someone from engineering to my room within about 20 minutes. He was able to fix a connection in the air conditioner and had a vent thermometer to show me the temperature was dropping. That corrected the problem. The king bed was comfortable. I found the desk chair uncomfortable. The commode in the bathroom was ridiculously small and uncomfortable for a room that cost over $250 a night. While not very large, the room was clean and pleasant enough overall. Deserving high praise was the housekeeping staff and also the servers who took care of us during the private breakfasts, lunches, and dinner we enjoyed during our conference at the hotel. They were extremely friendly, and the food was good. Can't comment on the hotel restaurant, as I never ate there.

Westin is good.","reviewText":"The Westin is certainly not the most expensive place to stay in San francisco, but the Westen is exactly what one should expect when staying at a large international-chain hotel: daily room cleaning, nice bathrooms w/ lighting, a full length mirror, option of bed sizes and room arrangements, room service and lobby/hotel restaurant, a \"couple\" of good concierges, prompt service with easy check-out, small hotel gym, and the assortment of amenities (hair dryer to laundry services) and free printing for airline boarding passes. That said, the natural trade-off is ridiculously expensive food, mini-bar items, and internet access. We're not talking rocket science - You got $1,200 - 2,000 to throw-down, you're gona have a great hotel experience. Be sure to read the fine print on the in-room items, such as room-service and laundry service. For example: room service (for breakfast at least) is the exact menu and pricing as served in the downstair's restaurant. At the time of our stay, there was a 20% gratuity added, plus and additional $5 delivery charge. Lesson: don't pay the room-server a gratuity, just sign the bill and say \"thank you\". With the exception of the $5 delivery charge, you won't pay any more for room service. So, if you're a busy conference/business traveler, suck-up the $5 and have a relaxed start to your busy day, at your own pace.

Went and got the resturant manager who honestly I don't think got it. Not a word of appology, just seated us. Now not even fine resturants would have offered a comp of some sort, nothing.

The first night there were young women screaming, laughing, and knocking on doors at 130 am. When I called the front desk, I got no answer as I let it ring over 20 times. We eventually confronted the girls and they eventually stopped making noise. The following evening, we were awoken by gentlemen in the room next to ours at 330 am. The were yelling and laughing in their room so loud that it kept us awake. I got up and went down to the front desk and explained the situation to the lady and she apologized and said she would send security right up. Security did arrive within 5 minutes and talked to the noisemakers. This issue can happen to anyone. But the lack of making an effort to right what had happened is what bothered me. When we went to check out of the room. They asked how our stay was? When we replied honestly, their comment was, \"Sorry to hear that!\" \"That will be $97.90 for the valet. Would you like to leave it on your card?\" They made no sincere effort to take care of our issue in any sort of manner.

Courteous, friendly and beyond helpful, you couldn't ask for better. On presenting my SPG card when checking in, I was even given a room upgrade, many thanks Westin! I take a good look round when checking out to ensure I've got everything, and the room was spotless, even in corners, behind curtains, under the bed etc. The bathroom, if a little small, was also in excellent condition.\n\nOne thing to note: There is an electronic system that monitors the in room refreshments, and will add items to your account within seconds. You are cautioned to this, but the system seems a little too enthusiastic to register knocks to the tray as items being used. A word with the staff on the front desk had these charges voided, they know it can cause false alarms which is good, but curious children repeatedly lifting items could be a problem.\n\nThey lose a mark for the cost of in room internet access - just shy of $15 a day these days is a joke. The Westin isn't the only one charging this amount either but thankfully you can get access for free in the Starbucks across the street and in a few other places.

I told management, and expected they might investigate and make sure whoever owned the building that had the alarm was alerted so it might be shut off, but they said they weren't able to do that, and offered to move us to another room instead.\n\nWe did, and it was a much nicer room, with an awesome view, but we found out the next morning it was next to the service elevators, and the utility room where the housekeepers put their carts and things together, and it was quite noisy against our wall. Also, ours was a room designed for adjoining to another room and we could hear the neighbour clinking his ice bucket. Also, they didn't seem to know that ice buckets require plastic baggies (even after I requested one, they said they didn't stock them).\n\nSo, some drawbacks. But generally, a good experience.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Calgary, AB","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-07-12T03:41:10Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"491","reviewId":"17954950","photos":[],"itinId":"374650139","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Tony","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Close to main venues: Giants Stadium, Performing Center, Museums, Wharf.","reviewText":"I was pleased with the convenience and access to the various venues I intended to visit this time.

Granted, it was a long walk but what a wonderful way to see the city and sights. There are bus lines close to the hotel so you can just hop on and ride to your destination. The hotel was very clean and I loved the body pillow they had on the bed. I need to get one of those. The concierge was very helpful getting me directions to different places to eat and the desk clerk who checked us in was very polite. I loved the floor to ceiling windows in our room and the outside patio was beautiful! The resturant (Ducca) at the hotel was a bit pricey so we ate at other places. I loved the fitness room which had a lot of machines to workout on and everything in working condition. I will definitely go back to the Westin and recommend it to all my friends. Next time, I'm going to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art which is one block from the hotel.

Quite frankly, the \"heavenly bed\" fell a little short for me. I'm not sure if the chamber person accidentally put the feather bed with the comforter rather than as a mattress topper where it should have been or what but there was no \"cloud-like\" feel for me. Also, because the window could not be opened, I found the down comforter extremely warm, and ended up using the feather bed as my comforter. The A/C vent in the room kept making a clanking sound all through the night, which made sleep a major challenge. I was able to avert that next day by cranking the A/C on really high throughout the day and just turned it off before bedtime. This allowed the room to stay relatively cool till morning. Other than these two factors, everything else was great. The hotel upgraded us to the 18th floor with a view of the Yerba Buena Gardens and the Bay. The location could not be beat. We were minutes from Union Square but we didn't have any of the noise factor. I did have one other beef though...I think $14 for internet usage is ridiculous and they didn't even offer free WI-FI in their lobby and/or business center.

However, I was more than impressed throughout my entire stay here. Staff may not be quite as plentiful as they are at a high end hotel like the Fairmont, but their level of service came close. Through the revolving door and in under 10 minutes, we were checked in with a complementary room upgrade, bags whisked away, and seated in the bar with one of the best martini's I have had in a long time. The rooms were clean and ample enough by San Francisco standards. The beds were wonderful and the bathroom/ counter space was more than sufficient for a couple of ladies. The location was awesome and the views were impressive. Moreover, the next day we requested a late check out and they said \"of course\". When I told them 2 pm would be sufficient, they one upped me and told me we did not need to be out of our room until 3. The only downside I noticed was the parking rate, but there are plenty of parking garages nearby with more reasonable rates, if you don't mind walking a 1/2 block or so with your bags. Overall, the staff was gracious, the room was nice, and the location can not be beat for shopping, museums, and nightlife.

The other lady just needed to pick up the map, and we just needed to ask 2 questions. We waited at least 30~40 minutes just to make some kind of eye contact with her, she intentionally IGNORED us completely!!! Just a simple word, \"I will be right with you\" could have done the job. But this rude lady was just purposefully trying NOT to look at us, trying NOT to hear us. I finally snapped and said, \"Is there ANYBODY else who can help us, please?” She totally ignored me anyway. I was having such a great opinion toward this hotel until I encountered this lady. The hotel needs more training on the service people. She changed the whole trip to SF experience into negative. Also I wrote a complaining NOTE to the hotel directly, however ZERO response. I think that is rude too. So the service at this hotel scores the LOWEST ever.

Security comes up and can't open the door either. He calls the tech guy who says over the walkie talkie that \"maybe someone already occupies the room. It's happened BEFORE.\" Sure enough, we knock and someone answers, \"hello?\" This is a bad start. Apparently this person has the same last name as me.\nAnyway, before the boyfriend and I get too grumpy, the lady at the front desk kindly offers to upgrade us to an executive suite on the same floor and comp our wireless internet. The room was great! Views to the north of the bay bridge and the east, spacious bathroom, and of course the always wonderful heavenly bed of Westins. Thanks to the wireless internet, we quickly researched that the in house Italian restaurant had terrible reviews and decided to order from Cheesecake Factory a few blocks away. I do wish that the front desk mentioned there was a CPK right in front of the hotel instead of being completely unhelpful when we asked what we could order from around the hotel.\nParking is expensive ($54 after taxes) but it's for 24 hours - if you plan it out right, you can leave your car there and walk around the city or take cable cars around to the sights.

When we checked-in, we were told that the hotel did not have a two queen bed room available. Since we booked through Expedia, we were told that they do not guarantee the type of bed in the room. They offered us a king bed room with a rollaway cot to make up the difference. Not amused by our situation and remembering distinctly selecting the Westin because of the two larger bed option, I asked to speak with a manager. Although he reiterated the Expedia booking issue, he was sympathetic to our problem and offered to pick up the breakfast for the rest of our weekend stay there. The free breakfast was a nice touch, but what I cherished about my interaction with the manager was his sincere attempt at making our stay at the Westin as comfortable as he could. Although we settled for the single King bed room, he put us up on a higher floor with a great view of the city. When we checked into the room, we realized that the bathroom did not have a tub that we could use to bath our child. When we called down to be moved to another room, the same manager personally helped us move our luggage to another room with a tub. In fact, he had visited the second room personally to visually confirm the tub. I've stayed in many Westins and W Hotels, but I've never had a manager make a sincere effort to make our stay so comfortable.

From the moment I walked into the lobby my fears disappeared. The staff were all friendly and helpful, the lobby was very nice, so was the room, we were on the 20th floor in a Grand Deluxe ( I did read that upper floor rooms are nicer, don't know if that's true) and yes the bathroom was not big but it was fine and it had great shelving for toiletries. And of course the Heavenly Bed - the reason I stay at Westins - there's nothing like it. The location of the hotel is excellent - right around the corner a couple of blocks is Union Square. Also around the corner are the streetcar & bus stops. We didn't have a car so the parking cost was not an issue but you don't need a car in San Francisco - their mass transit options are everywhere. Also we didn't have our computers so not having WiFi was not an issue. As far as the MiniBar goes - if you don't touch the stuff you don't get charged for it. I read reviews that made it sound like if you just breathe on the tray you get charged - that's ridiculous.

I spent a great deal of time on the internet trying to figure out the SF transportation systems. If you prefer to ride public transport and save your money like we do, the BART subway takes you from the airport to the Montgomery station for $8.50 and you are only a few blocks from the hotel. You can then buy a 3 day pass at the trolley station for $20 and ride all MUNI transport around the city (trolley,cable car, bus). After doing this research, I called back the Westin to confirm my plan for transport to the hotel and the clerk told me that they did not know anything about BART! We were able to easily get to the hotel, but at arrival there was a very long line of people waiting to check in. It was a looong wait with only two people checking in and each having some issue with their current guest. The manager would pop out of the back room once in a while without acknowledging the line or offering to assist. Our assumption was that this was the norm at the Westin SF. Once checked in, we really enjoyed the hotel.

We only waited 5 minutes and the employees were very friendly and gracious. The parking in San Francisco is horrendous and we planned on taking everyone's advice and parking in the garage across the street from the hotel but decided to just do the valet parking at the hotel so that we didn't have to walk down the street with our luggage. It was $50 plus a $7 surcharge but we expected that ahead of time. The location was great. We were close enough we could walk to the ball park and also within walking distances to Union Square. The rooms were very clean and the bedding was very nice and comfortable. Our room was close to the elevators but you couldn't barely hear them - plus we agreed to that location because of the early check in.

Then he took our luggage out of the trunk, held it while we went around the building, and then had it at the check in desk when we got back. We checked in, got a room on the 20th floor, not the 4th, and the view was great. The only drawback was that our room did not have the double showerhead that was stated online. Not sure if this was only our room or all the rooms, but definately a 1 head shower. The bed was great, like all Westin beds. Would definatly stay here again if I had to choose a hotel downtown.

My only caveat is that this is clearly a renovated property from a lower-scale hotel. The ceilings are low, and the bathrooms are small.

The Westin looks like a business man's hotel that is attracting vacationers as well, probably by discounting, although it continues to have the business and conference/convention types. While bedrooms are perfectly pleasant, in a chain hotel style, the public areas are reminiscent of an upmarket airport departure lounge with little of distinction and certainly no atmosphere. However, the staff all seem to be very attentive and keen to meet the needs of guests. While bedroom cleaning was adequate, some of the passageways looked as though they would welcome the attention of a vacuum cleaner and one of the ice machine rooms had an empty wine bottle and a beer bottle top lying on a badly stained floor for 4 days. The offered room was not what had been requested and this did not seem to be a unique problem as others booking in at the same time also failed to get what they wanted in a fully booked hotel.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Hardgate","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-08-14T20:48:12Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"491","reviewId":"17956102","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"choi","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Close to All","reviewText":"We stayed here last year and we came back this year.

Good quality Starbucks Coffee / Tea, however we had a gripe with the paper cups (it's a hotel, not a coffee shop!) which took 2 days and a couple of conversations with housekeeping before they would bring us proper mugs. The fiance said the shower wasn't hot at times, though I never noticed myself. For international travellers, the hotel doesn't provide complimentary power adapters, so don't forget them!

I figured it wasn't worth wasting my time. Overall, The hotel was comfy and concierge was helpful. Our room view was a disappointment and there was no free wi-fi.

Walgreens in less than a block away, just in case you forget your toothbrush like I did. (or run out of baby wipes) There is a mall and lots of shopping just blocks away. We only had one tiny issue with this hotel....don't pick anything up from the mini bar or the snacks left out on top of the dresser. They are very expensive and as soon as you pick anything up you are charged. We didn't realize this and picked up a few things just to look at them (the snacks are very enticing and exotic looking) then we place them back without eating them or disturbing the packaging and found we were charged anyway for them.

No-one at the front desk seemed to bothered and were happy for me to trapse up and down the hotel trying to find a room.

The staff were warm and friendly and the bell hop was especially helpful when we arrived providing us with free maps and tips on where to go with the kids. We were impressed by the floor-to ceiling window view (we stayed on 24th floor) and could see Alcatraz and the Bay bridge. The beds were a bit soft for my taste but my wife liked them. The walls were solid and very quiet. The only sounds we heard at night were firetruck sirens passing on the street below and even then it was not too loud. The bar/lounge was interesting with the ultra modern seating arrangement of low pillows and a round room. The drinks and food in the lounge were expensive. We had to leave the hotel to find children friendly food but there is a Starbucks, McDonalds and Dennys all within walking distance. Attractions within one block are SFMOMA, the Yerba Buena Gardens, and lots of name brand shopping.

We were in a lower floor (the 7th), but had a corner room which gave us a little more of a \"suite\" feel as it was larger than the other rooms on the floor (from looking at the floor plan on the back of the room door). The hotel was perfectly situated in the heart of San Francisco and everything was so easily within walking distance. We walked to the Ferry Building (about 15 min.) to the Cable Car lines (about 5 min) and to Union Square (about 5 min) and we walked to Fisherman's Wharf (about 30 min). In terms of service, we really had little to do with the hotel staff. We stayed for 5 nights and only interacted with the doormen. We called down to the front desk to ask for a wake-up call, but never received the call the next morning. Good thing we had set the in-room alarm clock as a back up. It seems as though the hotel has finished with their 30 million dollar renovations as we encountered no construction while there. The Reebok Gym was well equipped with top of the line elliptical machines, treadmills, stationary bikes and weight systems.

I enjoy its proximity to both the SF Museum of Modern Art (SF MOMA) as well as the Moscone Center. Union Square is close by and transportation is a breeze from the hotel.\n\nThe rooms have been nice and appear well maintained, however I have noticed on my last two visits that the shower/bath tile grout has mildew on it. This bothers me as a top-rated hotel should have spotless bathrooms. The furnishings were comfortable and the high-speed internet service is handy.\n\nThe service by the is great. The doormen were really helpful and the people who work the bell service desk were extremely curteous and quick. They made my stay very pleasant with their attentive, cheerful attitudes and good advice\n\nI cannot comment on the Jester's Restaurant as I did not dine there on my last trip. There are so many wonderful restaurants in the area that I skipped it this time. I have had nice meals there, but that was back in June 2004.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"San Diego, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-01-20T06:48:50Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"491","reviewId":"17955072","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"agustin","brandType":"Expedia","title":"nice place, near union square, very close to every where i wanted to go.","reviewText":"i would go again just to go.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"los angeles","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-01-17T20:29:32Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"491","reviewId":"17955070","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Margaret","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great Location","reviewText":"Enjoyed a wonderful couple of days in the Argent.

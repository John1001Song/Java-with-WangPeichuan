Went back down and another person said no, that was a smaller room but they ran out and had one out of service.  So rather than telling me the truth they were deceptive.  When I asked how the would compensate for the difference they said they couldn't since I prepaid.  Yeah, right!\r\n\r\nNext day they moved us to the proper suite for the next 4 nights and only provided $25 of compensation.  Amazing.\r\n\r\nThen issues with housecleaning not cleaning my room when I asked because of a mix up with their enviro program.

We went there for cocktails on Saturday night  and ordered a drink for my father, a double absolute on the rocks with a splash of cranberry. It came back as an absolute and cranberry. The server thought we were unsatisfied because the drink wasn't filled to the rim when it actually shouldn't have been as full as it was.  So he put a few more ice cubes in and thought we wouldn't notice? The next morning, we went down to have breakfast there. We were seated and 15 minutes later, no one had even come up to see if we wanted coffee or anything to drink. When we flagged the only man that was working at that time down, he said \"we are busy, if you don't want to wait for service, I would suggest you go somewhere else\"...?

They were also generous on the towels. Staff was very friendly and courteous and enjoyed that they seemed very attentive. My room didn't get made up on Easter day as I stayed in until 10 AM. I thought usually they would come back around but would give them a break since it was the holiday so don't want to judge that too harshly.\r\n\r\nI think my only disappointment was that this hotel isn't a block or two further to the east or north. As long as you head east or north out of the hotel, the surrounding area is nice, great shopping and close to market where you can jump on the muni or bart. Head west or south and the neighborhood gets a bit iffy very quickly.\r\n\r\nTheir associated restaurant, Jaspers, had wonderful hamburgers and beer in the evening but the breakfast buffet was overpriced and underwhelming. I would recommend them for dinner but might try somewhere else for breakfast.\r\n\r\nOh and they do have a room safe in the minibar which I didn't realize until the second day...

It's so small that the toilette sits within about an inch of the wall, under the towel rack, so you have to sit sideways on the seat and the towels rest on your shoulders...be careful not to accidentally pull one down, and into the water, when you stand up!

Even this isn't easy because the sink sits under the aforementioned ledge so you don't even have full use of it's minuscule space.

Of course the hotel is a block away from San Francisco's skid row, which seems to grow larger all the time, so if that really bothers you maybe you should skip the Serrano (unless your taxi or limo delivers you to the door and you don't plan to do any walking in the neighborhood). \r\nMy only critical comment may be more about Expedia than about the Serrano:  I chose the Serrano because it was the least expensive hotel on Expedia that was close to where I was going (the Great American Music Hall on O'Farrell).  As I proceeded with doing my booking on Expedia, I noted that the price quoted in the headline did not include an additional mandatory \"resort fee\" to be paid directly to the Serrano on my arrival to cover things like use of the hotel's fitness center (which I never visited during my fifteen hour stay).  If that resort fee HAD been included in the price of the room, the Serrano would no longer have been the cheapest hotel in the area -- probably the Super 8 across the street would have been.  So despite the nice, reasonably quiet room, attractive lobby, courteous staff, etc., this is what I remember about my stay.  Hotels should think about this sort of thing when they set their pricing policies.  People remember most instances when they believe they are being misled or manipulated.

I can get so many ideas on a place just from pictures, but seeing it in person was great. The lobby was superb- Spanish/ American décor with iced cold water available for the guests waiting for the room, or pick up. The rooms were clean, comfy and I love the fact that you can open your windows to get a breeze of the wonderful San Francisco air. The staff was nice for the most part. All of them smiled despite the fact they were swamped by customers at times. There was one Asian lady who seemed like an iron fist though, fortunately I was helped by another nice gentleman. Our hotel room was in the 10th floor, right by the elevator. To my delight, the room was quiet, couldn't hear the elevators open and close, or the \"ding\" or the bell when the elevator arrived. The location of the hotel was perfect, just a few blocks from Union Square Poweel Muni and Bart Station, but it's in the nucleus of a circle of culinary treasures. Fino Italian restaurant and Sadana Japanese Restaurant is only 2 blocks up. The Curran Theatre and other great thai restaurants is just 1 block up.

The staff were helpful and friendly. The hotel is located in a convenient location, close to shopping and plenty of restaurant in the surrounding. Convenient parking right next to the hotel for $31.00 /day, minivan and large cars are $20 more. You have to check in early to get the best view of the city.

It is also close to public transport (bus, muni, BART) options that makes traveling around the city a breeze if you don't intend to walk all the way to the Golden Gate Bridge. The location comes with a minor cost though: you don't want to be on the wrong side of the hotel after a certain hour. Stick to O'Farrell and you should be safe.\n\nThe bar which is directly connected to the lobby (Jasper's) is VERY nice. Once you're in it is a bit noisy but the food and drinks were great. I missed the free morning coffee in the mornings since I can't drink coffee without eating anything but luckily there's a Starbucks just 2 blocks away so a quick breakfast was not an issue either.\n\nThe room I stayed in had a very nice view on 16th floor without much street noise (if any). Shiny on the mornings, dark enough to fall asleep easily at night. The amenities are quite good. I never used the TV or the minibar though. There is an awesome power socket/system on the desk inside the room that has 2 USB ports -one for a phone one for a tablet-, and multiple normal jacks. Not sure if it had universal plugs or not but it was impressive. The internet was free, very fast and reliable too.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"Location, price and the utilities in the room were simply great.

We were greeted very promptly the minute we pulled up to hotel and our luggage was loaded off and car parked in no time at all. Chris at the front desk was very nice and courteous and when we mentioned it was our wedding anniversary he gave us two free cocktails for the Jaspers bar. The bell hop brought our luggage up to our room and even got ice for us. Our room was small but decorated very nicely and was very clean and had top of the line toiletries.

The restaurant next to the hotel lobby was also highly rated and chic, however, we didn't get a chance to try its menu, despite its delicious selections.

The front desk agent was very polite and let us know that they didn't have any rooms available at the time but they would have them available around 2:30 - 3pm. We were not surprised and left our luggage with the bellman and toured the city. Upon check in, we were greeted by a new front desk agent who was also very amiable. He offered to have our luggage delivered to our room and let us know of the amenities the hotel offered. By the way, they offer complimentary wine tasting every evening in the lobby for an hour. The room was gorgeous, cozy and very clean. They even had bathrobes in the room for us to use. Housekeeping was extremely nice. The bellmen were very helpful when it came to recommending places to dine and nightlife options. I loved the decor as well.

Given some time we were able to walk to most other neighbourhoods (Chinatown, Japantown, Fisherman's Warf, North Beach). Its best to avoid the tenderloin neighbourhood on which the hotel borders.The hotel service was for the most part excellent! Staff were always very helpful in providing directions or answering questions. My only criticism is that it would be helpful if staff were more in-the-know about good places to eat or get a drink around the hotel. For example, staff were unaware of the funky Bourbon and Branch, a throwback to a 1920s speakeasy, located just around the corner from the hotel. A couple times we were also directed to places that had closed down or staff gave us the wrong address entirely. That being said, MOST of the staff were able to look up and give excellent and accurate directions.\nThe complimentary wifi was extremely helpful as we brought a laptop to plan our days or to purchase online tickets to events such as a Giants game.\nWe loved the complimentary wine hour! It was a great way to meet fellow guests and share ideas/advice on what to see and do around town. The 6-speed bikes provided by the hotel were fantastic and a great way to get around town for those who prefer some exercise over taxi or public transit.

There was no sign in the lobby, no notice given at check in or in my room. I had made a reservation at a restaurant nearby but cancelled it after seeing that room service had some great items and decided to stay in and relax,watch the Oscars and order from room service as I had an early appointment for work tomorrow morning. I called at 8:30 to place my order and got a message that said they were busy and to leave a message with my order. 50 minutes go by and no food, so I call the front desk and am told that room service is closed and that they were not able to change the message because they did not have the key to the office where the machine is. What?!? Ridiculous. It was then 9:30 and all the decent restaurants near the hotel were closed as it is Sunday night and any crappy food that was available would not arrive at least for 30-45 minutes.

I was smitten with the excellent service, location and charming old hip ambiance. This was my 4th stay, and it was as superb as ever, except too short, and I hope to stay longer sometime when my work allows. The crowd was decidedly different this time - many more tourists - so the glorious lobby wine reception was a bit more grim than in the past, but the excellence of the staff is truly a draw for me. Likewise, the location is literally the epicenter of everywhere I need to reach [art venues], and close to great eating and walking. The search on Expedia was for Kimpton chain hotels solely because of the fine experience I had with Serrano before [I had thought they were booked for my dates], so I was cheering aloud when I understood I could stay a location I am coming to consider a home away from home. In conclusion, as a New Yorker, I would say that the Serrano reminds me of the best place in the world - my home.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"New York, NY","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-09-12T03:56:23Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"4","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_ca","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"12493","reviewId":"18306013","photos":[],"itinId":"332550364","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"4105","userNickname":"Susan","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Our favourite hotel so far!","reviewText":"We recently stayed at the Serrano for 5 nights.

The king-sized bed had crisp, white linens, plump pillows and was one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in! The bathroom was small but adequate; nice and clean with hot water, good shower pressure and the Aveda products were a nice touch.\nThe hotel offers free coffee, tea and hot chocolate every morning in the lobby, along with a good selelction of newspapers which my husband appreciated; in the afternoons there was iced tea and lemonade with all the fixings to make \"Arnold Palmers\". The hosted wine tasting was very nice; the staff were very generous and the wines were good.\nAll of these little \"extras\" add a nice touch but the thing that makes this hotel a real gem is the staff; everyone we encountered from the front desk staff to the bell staff, the doormen, the bar staff and even down to the cleaning lady were fantastic! Friendly, pleasant accomodating and nothing was too much trouble for them; we received excellent advice about trips, car rentals travelling around town etc. They were all wonderful!

Later that day followed up with front desk, Nothing...No answer-they have no idea what is going to be going on with the construction. Nice.\nI was floored. Mainly because 1) I have been to hotels that are under construction and it is all over their website and completely disclosed BEFORE you arrive 2) usually there are discounted rooms because of the construction 3) Not disclosing that there is interior construction was amazing to me. 4) No offer to move rooms. I left a message for the manager. Next morning sure enough, 8:45am pounding, drilling same thing. This noise resonated through the room, it was miserable. Called downstairs, they will have the manager call asap. Received a call from manager who was nice and gave us a discount from our bill.

It was nice to have Macy's and Nordstrom and Bloomingdales and all the rest a short hop away, but in the evenings it was hard to find a good place to eat--it was all driven toward tourists with overpriced mediocre fare. All in all though it was a nice place to stay.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"DC","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-07-21T14:13:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Families","categoryLabel":"Families"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"12493","reviewId":"18305988","photos":[],"itinId":"328857800","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"myrna","brandType":"Expedia","title":"my kids love it..awsome hotel","reviewText":"great hotel.

On Monday morning, my nightmare began. Workers were literally hacking the extrenal wall of the room in which I was sleeping at around 8.30am. At first, the hacking was intermittent and I tried to cover my ears and continued sleeping. However, it was no time before the hacking intensified to the extent that I could not hear the front desk after I called and complained about the noise. All the frontdesk could say was we will shift you to another room. How ridiculous that was! Knowing that I'd be checking out in a few hours time, aren't they adding more inconvenience to me by suggesting that they can move me to another room? In the 1st place, they should have the decency to consider the existing renovation works in allocating rooms to guests such that they will be least affected by it. Serrano did not and their attitude towards the entire incident was indifferent. This is a good example of poor customer service.

After reading hundreds of excellent reviews from many different sources i decided to 'give it a go'. Wow, the reviews were right! The lobby (where complimentary morning beverages & evening wine is served) was plush and tastefully decorated. The bedroom (i booked a deluxe king and was given an executive suite) was nothing short of fabulous. A gigantic comfortable bed, a sofa, two huge widescreen TV's, one with a DVD player, fridge plus separate honor bar, huge bathroom with a jacuzzi bath for two, super luxury (brand new) bathrobes, Aveda toiletries................ the list goes on! The decor was immaculate; no chipped walls or scratched furniture here. The rooms were cleaned to the highest of standards every morning (you'll find no dust on skirting boards or inside drawers at the Serrano). Plenty of fluffy soft white towels and toiletries were replaced daily; as was the bed linen. Everything you could possibly want was to hand; ice machines, cold fridges, selection of glasses in room, very well stocked honor bar, selection of pillows etc. I seldom stay at a hotel and have nothing to moan about; however the Serrano ticked all of the boxes and surpassed all of my expectations.

The Serrano was also close to good dining and theatre.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"San Diego","reviewSubmissionTime":"2004-12-14T23:50:19Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"12493","reviewId":"18306043","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Jocelyn","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Would not hesitate to return!","reviewText":"Our stay at the Serrano was wonderful.  I'm fairly picky about hotels, particularly with regard to cleanliness.  Not an issue here.  The building is clearly older, and the rooms are a bit small, but I guess that's what a \"Boutique Hotel\" is. However the lobby, elelvators, hallways, and our room were all very well maintianed. I was very, very comfortable.  They offer free coffee and tea in the mornings, and wine in the evening in the hotel lobby, and it was great  fun to socailize with some of the other hotel guests. And the restaraunt Ponzu!  I have been generally skeptical about of a lot of the new asian-fusion cuisine, but Ponzu has broadened my mind.  We usually try to avoid the hotel restaraunt in our travel, but this time we  couldn't pull ourselves away.  Staff was helpful, warm and very freindly, and the concierge Stephan helped us with all of out tour arrangements.\n\nAll-in-all, a wonderful stay.  Thank you Serrano!!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Nation's Capital","reviewSubmissionTime":"2004-11-18T13:34:34Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"12493","reviewId":"18306041","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Colleen","brandType":"Expedia","title":"What an incredible find!","reviewText":"We had a terrific time at the Serrano Hotel.

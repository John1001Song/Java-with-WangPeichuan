When we arrived the entire hotel was under renovation. The gym and computer rooms were closed for renovation. This is fine, but when we booked not once were we notified of the condition of the hotel. This was a very disappointing experience. It taught me a lesson and questions to always ask prior to booking a hotel e.g. Is your hotel under any type of remodel? Are the amenities mentioned on your website all available? The valet person working all week would get into arguments with the front desk people every single time I saw him. This made me uncomfortable with him handling a rental car I was responsible for. The front desk staff were all great. There is even a amazing Mexican place and Starbucks directly connected to this hotel. I think once all their construction is complete it could be kinda cool, but unfortunately we had a terrible experience due to the construction. The bathroom in our room was tiny. There was literally no counter and we had to leave or stuff in the sink. Last, do something about the valet driver. He even double parked my rental in the bus/taxi lane right in the CENTER of the lane. What a bad experience.

Our overall experience was okay.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The room itself was a little small but decorated perfectly for the size.  The in room refrigerator smelled and didn't seem clean.  We opened the window covers to discover that we couldn't look through it.  The window was quite from the outside.  We felt that the air quality in the room seemed stuffy and full of pollutants.  As a result, we had difficulty sleeping throughout the night.  I did notice that the air conditioner in the room and the vent in the bathroom was really dusty.  It had not been vacuumed for a long time.  Also, the water pressure of the shower was really weak.  It was hard to take a quick shower.  LOL.  Lastly, we were excited to take advantage of the Sake happy hour.  However, we were disappointed to see that the Sake was in the front lobby on a small cart near the entrance of the hotel.  There was really no where to sit and relax.  We thought it was going to be in a lounge where people can sit and talk.  Again, our experience was okay.  It was good enough for the night but not good enough if we had to stay longer.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"Hip/ Contemporary and decorated nicely for a small room with a queen bed","negativeRemarks":"The hotel can improve on the way they clean the room and fix the pressure of the water in the shower.

But I paid nearly $300 a night which was way too much for a hotel without a bar and restaurant, merely a Starbucks tagged to the side and a Mexican. No help to take cases to room and when I arrived in the room I found it pretty underwhelming. The room was very small indeed, bathroom even smaller. You can tell the rooms are tired from the multiple layers of paint on the doors. The toilet seat would not stay in the upright position, something which infuriates me immensely! However, the bed was extremely comfy and lighting in the room good. The TV quality was poor with a grainy picture - clearly not digital. I would stay here again should the price be lower, I left feeling ripped off which is never good. I found the service good but the lady that checked me in albeit very polite was maybe just a bit too much! I guess you need to judge your customer as to how to act to them, not an easy task I know and perhaps just a difference in culture and taste!

The hotel is not bad but the hotel did not meet up to the expectations of the pictures. Therefore the hotel was underwhelming. Hotels in San Francisco are very expensive and I usually like to stay at something under $200. That is impossible to find in San Francisco other than dump hotels or airport hotels. Hotel Diva was around the $300 range. I dont think it really looked like a $300 a night hotel.  The room was ok. It had some nice design elements to it. Interesting head board, etc. I did have a separate sitting room/den with a flat screen tv., fun window  screen, beaded curtain for the coat closet. But like i said, not the luxury hotel i was thinking of.  The location was ok. It is on theater row. So it reminded me a lot of Times Square in NYC with all the usual party animals staggering about at night and all sorts of sketchy people during the day.

Inside the lobby was run down and the elevator didn't work. The hotel doesn't have parking and the nearby garage charged us $50 to park our car for just one night. When we got up to the rooms, they were disgusting. The walls were dirty and scuffed. Rooms were incredibly small and the bathroom looked like it had never been cleaned. One of the pillows had makeup on it. The TV and air conditioner didn't work. We called to complain and the front desk said that there was nothing they could do because maintenance had already left and so did house keeping. We wanted to leave and asked for a refund but they refused to give us one because they said the manager wasn't there and we would have to take it up when they got there at 8a.m. We then called Expedia to see if they could help us out. Expedia talked to the front desk and they were told the same thing but made a note and said they would follow up with us in the morning. Since we are from out of town and didn't know our way around the city, and $450  out of money from the cost of the 2 hotel rooms we were forced to stay overnight. I called the front desk at 8am but the manager still wasn't in, she didn't ge in until 10 in the morning and when I told her everything we had been through over the night and complained also about the cold shower in the morning she said there was no records of me ever having filed a complaint and she would not refund the money!

I found her comment so offensive.

The door led to an entryway with 2 separate rooms on either side. No living area to pass it off as a suite. One room was bare with just 1 small table, dimly lit, & had a murphy bed in the wall.  I guess since we were \"two ladies\" she thought we should stay in separate rooms?! We both ended up staying in the one room which was a normal hotel room. This setup is only good for a couple traveling with young kids.\r\n\r\nLater: The lobby door locks at 11pm. We got back several hours after. From the door we could see the lady at the desk. She was helping 2 men check out. We tugged the door handle to get her attention. It was 5 steps away to come open the door. The men saw us, she didn't even look up.

Right across from major theaters on Geary, beside a Starbucks and just a few steps from the famous David's Delicatessen, a block from Union Square and about four blocks from China Town. The staff was nice enough and the room was clean enough. However, don't make the mistake I made. Upon check in, I was given the option of a room in the back, where I was told it would be quiet, or a room with a view in front, where I was told it was noisy. Well, my husband and I sleep with white noise so I figured it would cover the street noise in the front. WRONG!!! Geary is a very busy street, and for the most part, the street never slept, and neither did I. I take full responsibility for this, as the clerk did tell me the truth. But you can trust me on this! Nice views of the street and its vibe, but not nice at night. Wear ear plugs! Or get a room in the back where it'll be quieter. Last complaint, the bed was like a rock. If the bed had been more comfortable, I'd have given the hotel five stars, but I have been sore since I slept in the bed (three days now).

After an early flight that was a particular blessing, and Christine was dear in facilitating it. The rooms are very small and appointed in modern (I suppose) art that borders on disconcerting. There were two troubling encounters with the concierge. On the first, he sold us tickets to one of the bus tours and disregarded our appeal for a five dollar off special, though we pointed it out in the ad that his hotel distributed. Second, when he told us he would handle reserving airport transport and there was a delay in doing so, he asked why we had gone to them in the first place, telling us that they were notorious for bad service. (As it turned out, they got us where we needed to be at the time we needed to be there) I felt it was rather like telling me a restaurant had been tagged with a poor health rating after learning I'd eaten there. This is mundane I suppose, we found that the menu button to order movies did not work, and when we told this to the front desk we were told that they needed to be alerted first in order to turn on the service. We did, and it still did not work. Finally though, this was Pride weekend, and the night before the parade they had one fellow on the front desk. He was good, but he should not have been asked to handle the myriad of woes that might, and did, come his way. It might've have been wiser to have someone working with him.

What an unpleasant way to greet a first time guest or to show partnership with groups like Expedia that bring them business. I did tell her that I didn't like her unpleasant attitude, at which she replied sarcastically, \"Enjoy your room.\" No surprise, no apology.\n\nI found an interior room with one small window that couldn't be opened unless you wanted your neighbor viewing inside. The bathroom was large, since it was a disability room, but it had no sink or mirror. For that, you went back into the room and around the corner near the closet. It was certainly an odd layout. But being interior, no street noise to bother.\n\nThe furnishings were great and the bed was super comfortable. A nice touch was a small shaving kit of \"Art of Shaving\" cream and some make-up remover pads. I thought it was a little \"cute\" that they had a price list of all the removable pieces like pillows and throws - I guess they must get a lot of theft so I appreciated the honesty and throwing it out there.

Once you walk out the doors, there are a million things to do and places to eat. The gym also has small lounges for guests to meet at and also a small gym with cardio machines and free weights. (Just enough for a nice workout). There is also cable TV in all the rooms and a safe in the closet.\n\nI honestly loved this hotel. I didn't want to leave. I would highly recommend it in s heartbeat, and I will definitely be going back.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"Modern look, everything was updated and innovative and friendly staff!","negativeRemarks":"Nothing.

Depending on how & when you arrive at the hotel, the traffic could make a taxi ride a little more pricey. But, the location offers walking distance to everything! Shopping & public transportation down on Market Street are only a few blocks away. There's a Starbucks just off the hotel lobby that opens at 5:30 am which was super convenient for me, as a runner, who had to be up early for the race. It's also great for tourists heading out early for sightseeing. There's also an authentic Mexican restaurant- Colibri off the lobby as well and a pizza place next to that so while SF has endless other dining options, these are great places to keep in mind if you don't feel like going too far. Also convenient was a Walgreen's just 2 blocks up from the hotel where you can pick up snacks, bottled water or anything you may have forgotten to pack. The hotel staff, especially Eileen, were lovely and always happy to help. They made me feel like an old friend as I returned to the hotel each time.

I attended this hotel for business meetings in SF and have stayed here in years past. The room I received was decorated in modern style with a leather sofa sleeper, two leather swivel chairs and a huge king size bed. I had a street facing view (whereas other rooms have an internally facing view of other rooms) on the second floor which faced the Curran theatre, however, my only gripe was that my particular room did not have any AC! Given the recent humid heat wave, it was quite unbearable and forced me to open the two windows inviting all aspects of street noise, smoke from people passing by (due to being on the 2nd floor), and lack of privacy. When I addressed this with the hotel at check out, they informed me that I should have asked for a fan when I was thinking that they should just leave standing fans in the room so the guest doesn't have to bother the front desk. I'm also thinking that the room has poor heating since an electric resistance heater was unplugged and didn't look adequate to cover the entire room. The room also had poor lighting and I had to turn on every floor lamp, bed lamp and overhead lamp to light the room.On a positive note, the room had an alcove by the entrance with a dedicated office/bar with a mac mini.\n\nHotel Diva is a very eclectic hotel and if you want something with personality, this might be up your alley but be sure and avoid room 222!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"Contemporary feel","negativeRemarks":"Dedicated AC or at least standing fans in room 222!","locationRemarks":"Very convenient to Union Square, SOMA (South of Market Area), etc.","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Los Angeles","reviewSubmissionTime":"2013-06-28T13:37:15Z","roomTypeId":1221,"userDisplayName":"Derek","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"11771","reviewId":"54011720","photos":[],"itinId":"156828702011","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"KK","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Overpriced and noisy!!!","reviewText":"We booked this hotel because of the location and that was the only positive thing.

The elevators are slow but didn't seem to be well used. I took the stairs being on the third floor. The hotel is an old renovated building- like many in San Fransisco. The room was small but being out all day seeing the sites - who cares! I would recommend an inner room (i.e. not facing the street). The narrow streets in this area amplify street traffic, not to mention the constant sirens. Only real compliant was the 3:00 am garbage pick up.

It was painfully loud and so annoying to a tired traveler, I don't remember what time it ended - pretty early (9 p.m. or so) but we were unfortunately irritated by it. The second negative - since we had prepaid with Expedia they needed to put a hold on our credit card. They said they would hold $50 but actually put a hold on $1,250! When I discovered this over halfway into our stay I brought it to the attention of the staff and was told it would be corrected and \"I hope you didn't need the money for shopping!?

In the fitness center it was hot and the air conditioner did not appear to cool sufficiently. A nice sized plasma TV, had a smashed screen. (This was taken down Saturday). The equipment was nice, 2 treadmills and an elliptical, 4-5 weight machines, free weights and a bench. The computer lounges need help. Do not put a MAC in there and then tell the user to log in using IE. They are not compatible and you get an error on 90% of any site. The monitor was up high, with a bar stool. The key board is at chin level, very uncomfortable to use. Update this area soon. The business center was much nicer was being used much more.

I have stayed in a few more expensive hotels around the city, but the Diva feels a lot more 'homely'. While the building itself feels a little old, the rooms and the service are very good. There are free internet machines on some floors for those of use without laptops (there is also wifi of course), and snack machines, DVD rental, fitness room. The only downside is the slightly dodgy location west of union square, and that one of the rooms I got had a window onto the street which was not airtight, leaving a lot of street noise in.

My room was really small and the window was frosted so I couldn't see outside. The concierge never seemed to be on duty so I had to ask at the front desk how to get to a tour I took one morning. They were kind of rude and threw a map at me. Also, when I checked out they had an incorrect movie charge on my bill that I had to have taken off.

I missed my flight and they were willing to accomodate me for another night at the same rate. My original room wasn't available anymore but they let me check out a couple of other rooms to make sure I found one that was to my liking. Depending on what room you get, the mirror and sink might be outside of the bathroom. Oh, their heating and air conditioning worked well, which was great since the other hotel i stay at before Hotel Diva had a system that didn't work well at all.

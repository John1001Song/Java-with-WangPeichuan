Many of the rooms have a view facing the parking lot - this was disappointing as I had requested a waterfront room weeks before stay and was told by hotel staff that it would be no problem and that my request would be placed in the comments. Halfway through our stay we were moved to a waterfront room which was very nice. Added a day to our stay on a separate reservation and it appeared to cause problems including the hotel not wanting to honor the expedia price, even though 5 nights of our stay were via the expedia reservation. We were not complaining, as we had a good stay and enjoyed the hotel, just wanted to pay the price our reservation dictated. This caused our trip to be delayed as the front desk staff told us we had to wait for a manager to come in 15 minutes. After waiting 15 minutes; no manager arrived and we were again told the manager would arrive in 15 minutes from then. This second staff member became argumentative and unpleasant even though I showed her the paperwork displaying my 2 separate reservations and the fees associated with both. Left the hotel feeling very frustrated with how we were treated and likely would not choose this hotel again.

We stayed just 1 night for  a graduation. Rooms were clean, spacious, beds were very comfortable. The king room was very nice with a view of the marina and to have an outside patio so I could sit with a glass of wine, was a good way to end 7 hours of driving. Also you can watch the planes coming in for San Francisco from the patio. The king room had a Keurig, we didn't use it -but is nice to know you can bring your favorite coffee along.  I liked that there was a small couch to sit on while reading/watching tv.  Both rooms had vanities outside the bathroom, they also had showers with clear glass doors and the toilet is also in there. So a bit awkward if needing toilet while someone is showering. The king had a spacious closet & mini fridge, the queen had a tall narrow armoire-no fridge (maybe upon request?).  The breakfast had make your own waffles, fresh fruit salad, canned slice peaches, cottage cheese, hard boiled eggs, cereals, oatmeal, toast, bagels, muffins, fresh whole fruit (banana, apple, orange), pastries and coffee, milk, tea, juices to drink. We arrived at a great time!..they had just put out fresh baked cookies-Otis Spunkmeyer! We had no issues with either room, front desk was very friendly and helpful.

Very near the airport, yet surprisingly, very quiet. The staff is exemplary, always polite and pleasant and helpful. One nice touch for air travelers is the computer with printer for boarding passes right in the lobby area. An excellent breakfast is included. So do not let the \"old\" look of the halls turn you from this gem of an inn.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2012-03-28T19:41:59Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"51116","reviewId":"29186811","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"gem","reviewText":"Friendly staff, comfortable room and bed, very clean.

Note: sincere. The location was nice, quiet, and away from any major freeways. My room even had a nice view of the sunset overlooking the San Leandro Marina. Horatio's, the adjacent eatery, provides their room service; however, if a full bar is what you desire, make the short walk across the parking lot. It's all well worth it! Lastly, the price could not be beat as compared to comparable chain hotels in proxmity. (Oh, that tiny detail I found annoying?

Excellent service and price. Not super well located in terms of public transportation, but the shuttle to BART and area amenities takes care of much of this.\n\nSan Leandro is centrally located to much of the Bay Area, and would make a good home base for anyone traveling on business to SF, San Jose, and points east. 15 minutes to Oakland Airport, less than an hour to SFO and San Jose airports. For vacationers, it's quiet, has free parking and transportation, and a nice view of the bay outside. Only a couple of bland restaurants at the marina, but a park with spectacular views.\n\nRooms were just fine, not fancy. Did have a microwave and fridge. But only a shower, so maybe not best for tots. Quiet, decent mattress, clean. What more do you need for this price?\n\nI stayed there for business, while my hubby tagged along. He was able to get the shuttle to public transportation while I was able to zip out to 880 for meetings around the bay. Breakfast is above average for this level of hotel, with actual fresh fruit, waffles, boiled eggs and the usual pastry, bagels, etc.\nThe staff was very, very nice.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Central Coast, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-04-18T15:15:59Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"chutti","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"51116","reviewId":"19007479","photos":[],"itinId":"334223593","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Sandi","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great stay in Oakland area.","reviewText":"We enjoyed staying at the Marina Inn in San Leandro.

If you want to pay (or bill your company) more, and insist on super-plush and a luxurious lobby, try elsewhere. If you enjoy personal service, conscientious employees, open, scenic surroundings with plenty of walking trails, an excellent restaurant just a100 yard walk away, and high quality basics at a great price, try the San Leandro Marina Inn. The continental breakfast is basic but very good, and very carefully tended. A boarding pass printing computer is set up conveniently in the lobby, in addition to the FREE computer room for other needs. The room TVs are new, large flat screens. The walking trails along the bay are great for a short or long walk or run, or just for the view. You don’t even have to get on the expressway to get there from the Oakland airport.\n\nFor my purposes I enjoy the San Leandro Marina Inn far more than the much higher priced chain hotels.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Ann Arbor, MI","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-02-17T17:23:28Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"60000","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"51116","reviewId":"19007480","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"","reviewText":"","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":2,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2006-07-28T15:37:27Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]}]}}}

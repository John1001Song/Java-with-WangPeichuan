I book end my stay in SF , as I used to live there and love to visit my old town. I stay on Geary - either at the Adagio or the Monaco. This time, I booked the Adagio, which was recently taken over by Marriott , as a boutique hotel. Rates went up a bit , the facility looks much better, rooms refreshed, but there are some things that they could improve.\n\nThe rooms are nice , spacious. I asked them to check my old ' preferences' but those were lost during transition.\nLovely water with fruit in lobby!\nNo real concierge, but a nice bar and sitting area. Coffee in the morning complimentary.. but it was weak ( yes.. we love our coffee). Also, we had a problem with sour 1/2 and 1/2 that we had to point out to the coffee staff. Really , sour cream? Yuk!\n\nThe room was comfortable. But the bath needs improvement. No place to put anything. Dryer not good for ' real' hair drying or styling. And that darn fan. Women need to use a mirror to put on makeup, do hair. Bath fan off.. not an option.. so annoying. Same with trying to quietly slip in late at night while spouse is sleeping. Separately switch the fan please!!!\nI hope that Marriott gets the fine details nailed soon. No shower cap.

We loved all the art galleries on Geary St and the square was buzzing with all sorts of entertainment and activities. We had tickets for the City sightseeing hop on and hop off bus tour. We were very impressed when they told us they had a shuttle to their office some blocks away to collect the actuall tickets to do the tour. San francisco is a very \"walker friendly\" city.

We decided against renting a car and found that to be the best option, parking here isn't cheap and public transportation is pretty reliable. Staff at the front desk were very helpful with questions about how to navigate the city.\n\nWe were disappointed at the lack of continential breakfast but it seems this is not out of the ordinary for San Francisco hotels. There are plenty of delicious coffee shops for breakfst in the area. We did take full advantage of the free tea and cofee in the lobby. There was also fresh water in the lobby with nice fresh fruit soaking in for a water bottle fillup on the way out or a nice refeshing glass after a long day of walking.\n\nThe room was pretty spacious and clean. Sharing a hotel room with two other women, we had enough space to spread our things arround without feeling cramped. We were on the six floor with a window view of the parking lot, but honestly we spent more time exploring the city so the lack of a breathtaking city view didnt take away from our stay.

However one of our TVs was not working properly and I was frustrated with Maintenance because the guy pretended to fix it, left the room and it went out again. When I called the front desk again, the guy never came back. I finally called after an hour and told them we were going to bed and to replace the TV the next day while we were gone. The room had a mini fridge and microwave. I don't know if this was just our room or not, but I have never seen this before - a hole cut into the ceiling in the shower area with a pipe coming out of it. We were nervous that either a camera would poke out of it while we were bathing or some kind of nasty water would leak out. Neither happened, but it seemed like a lazy way to fix a problem and I didn't like it. Long lines at breakfast and they frequently ran out of plates, bowl, trays, and silverware. The food was decent. Right outside the hotel is a nice greenway next to the water. We took a nice stroll. The hot tubs were closed for maintenance and the pool was not heated because of that. Needless to say the water was probably only 70 degrees. And they close the pool 8-8:30 which is pretty much the exact time you want to use it- after sightseeing and before bed. The atrium was pretty.

What we were not told, until we discovered it upon our arrival, was that the hotel was undergoing major refurbishments. This meant no use of the pool (although we could walk over to the neighbouring Hilton.... and walk back soaking wet !!). The main central part of the hotel which should have been full of exotic plants and fish was a building site. There was scaffolding up almost everywhere with plastic sheeting covering certain areas. I do understand why this hotel is under refurbishment .... it needs it. The parts we were allowed access to were old.The room where breakfast is served had a \"sticky\" carpet and the bar where free drinks and snacks were available had a bad smell about it. This put us off going in there for our free refreshments. The room itself was spacious. The bed linen and towels were clean, in fact the room as a whole was clean ..... just old. The toilet wasn't fixed to the wall properly and moved when sat on. The balcony door was dirty which spoiled the view of the bay a little.

Instead we waited 25+ mins for the hotel shuttle to pick us up at the airport and we finally got to the hotel to find out that although I was informed that transportation was included that it actually was NOT. My husbands and the other couple then had to make a decision about how we would get around for the length of our stay. We decided to rent a car and we ended up paying a much higher price to rent a vehicle once we arrived instead of the price we saw online beforehand. In Sept I had decided not to reserve a car based on the information provided to me on 2 separate occassions by hotel representatives. To rectify the situation the staff did upgrade us at no cost to a bayview room which was beautiful and much appreciated, however I was still very disappointed in the incorrect information I received which resulted in us having to spend extra money not budgetted for.

But we do hear railway noises (not sure late at night or early in the morning since I didn't check the time), I believe it is from Caltrain.\n\nHotel needs touch up work on those wood panels especially the wooden frame of the elevator. It is not run-down, they just need to make the appearance inline with the hotel brand.\n\nComplimentary breakfast is great, lots of varieties.\nWhen we checked-in, we were given incorrect breakfast service ending time. The first morning when we came to the breakfast area, service staffs told us that breakfast just ended. But they were very helpful, since there were some food from the cook-to-order counter, they asked us if we would like them, of course, we took them.

We inquired about what time the shuttle started and were told. \"The information and schedule are at the end of the counter.\" Upon review of this information we discovered that you needed to request the shuttle for early morning pick-up (prior to 4:30am). We were then told we needed to \"call\" and request it despite standing at the desk. We also inquired about where to catch the shuttle back as we wanted to return our car that night and take the shuttle back to save time in the morning. We were told, \"exit the airport, go to the curtesy shuttle lane and look for the Embassy Suites shuttle.\" We did this only to discover that there are 2 Embassy Suites with airport shuttles and we ended up at the wrong Embassy Suites (which seemed much nicer and had very helpful front desk personnel). The front desk called our hotel and asked if they woul pay for our cab back to the correct hotel. Although they paid the cab fare, they did not provide the driver a tip, so we paid that out of our pockets. Additionally the computers in the business center were down and our hotel room had horrible cell reception (for muliple carriers). When we asked for a reccommendation for a local shopping mall, we were told, \"I don't know\" by the unfriendly front desk personnel.

It was also the site for breakfast, which included made to order omelettes, french toast (only served on the first day), pancakes, eggs, potatoes, and also an array of continental breakfast offerings including oatmeal and cereal.\n\nWe were on the 7th floor with a great view of the whole hotel. The room itself was relatively standard, but adequate and with well-thought out amenities. Very appropriate for the price I paid.\n\nThe pool had really warm water and the work out room, though small, was nice and adequate and attached to the pool area.\n\nThe hotel was right next to the hotel, within 5 minutes driving time, and had a free shuttle. Unfortunately, the day one of my family members left for the airport the shuttle was very behind and there was a situation where the driver was refusing to take passengers. It was unfortunate and caused some panic among our family members, and may have caused others to miss flights. Would recommend caution for anyone relying on the shuttle to go to the airport.\n\nOverall, a very convenient and well-priced hotel w/ a great view of the bay and a beautiful lobby with a full service breakfast.

The room was clean and comfortabel for the most part, but the sofa bed was in very poor conditions. A note to the hotel managers: Please understand the major reason I chose this hotel was because I was traveling with children and therefore needed the sofa bed. Also, the temperature control in the room did not work. (Yes, I know I could have called the front desk, but it was very late and we were just too tired!) The front desk staff was nice and friendly, but I am afraid I cannot say the same for the staff at the breakfast stations. The breakfast was good and convenient, though.

My son was going to be sleeping on the sofabed. It looked like they didn't change the sheets, the nightstand next to our bed was dirty,looked like someone had drinks on it and left round dryed stains on it. I also found hair in the tub which really was bad. I called down to the front desk to tell them what I had found and they apologized and sent housekeeping right up to clean everything. They also told me I could switch rooms if I wanted to but we decided to stay as long as they took care of everything. I have to say that the remaining nights our room was cleaned very well. Everyone from the front desk to housekeeping were very nice. The grounds are beautiful as well as the lobby and breakfast areas. The breakfast was great. You will not find a better one anywhere. We did have the bay view which was very nice and fun to watch the planes flying in and out. We never really heard the planes when we were sleeping. Our bed was really confortable.

This was by far the worst experience we've had with this name brand. Opportunities: When we arrived in our room the fans in both the suite area and bedroom were extremely loud. Also the bedspread and blankets were dirty. When they replaced the blanket they brought one with burn holes in it. They eventually repaired the loud noises from the fan by unpugging it. This happened after several phone calls and visits to the front desk. Housekeeping was terrible as they didn't change out the drinking glasses in our room during our entire 4 day stay. After day one we went to a local store and bought plastic cups. Housekeeping did not replenish the tiolet tissue. They didn't remove the trash that was left on the floor. We had to sit this outside the room each day. The refrigerators in the rooms need replacing as they are outdated and dirty. Strengths: The views are extraordinary and the location is great. We moved throughout the San Frncisco Bay area without any issues and the freeway both north and south is easy to access.

The room had two flat-panel TVs and other amenities as well. They served cook-to-order complementary breakfast (omelets and pancakes were cooked in front of us). The access to SFO was very easy and only 5 minutes (I think it would take you only 10 minutes to get SFO even during rush hours). You don't have to take US101 if you want to use local streets. No worry with getting lost on the way. Two disappointments about the hotel. 1) The lobby was a little unorganized and noisy for this class of hotel. When we arrived, some children were running around. I personally don't like a hotel to where parents take their children, but nothing annoyed us in our own room, so it was OK. 2) The hotel has a bar named Ring(if I remember right). Some attendants were rude and didn't know how to treat their customers. The bar itself has nice bay view with SFO and Bay Bridge in the background. Overall, we enjoyed our stay there and will go back again if we have a chance.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Reno, NV","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-03-05T21:46:05Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"42336","reviewId":"18257401","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Mary","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great Stay....will stay here again","reviewText":"Very nice stay..clean rooms and very comfy beds.

They also told us about local pizza places that were delivering as well, which we used. They gave us about 10 chem-lights to light the room while we waited. Once the lights came on WOW! Big rooms! It was hard to tell in the dark. Overall a very nice place, and our check-in went surprisingly smooth even thought there were obvious hardships they were dealing with no power. I would stay there if I had to be near the airport, but not if I were vacationing and wanted to go downtown every day. BUT... The room was a lot cheaper than the downtown hotel we had, and a lot bigger.

The pullout sofa bed in our room fell apart every night - very uncomfortable. The heating was very noisy and not level in the two rooms - over hot in one, cold in the other.

We stayed here upon our arrival to SF and upon our departure from SF. SF was not our final destination. Our first night, we had problems with the heat. The room was so hot you couldn't breathe. It wouldn't turn off nor could we cool the room. The heat was being controlled by the hotel and we were told it would be taken care of. I don't believe it was because we left our window opened all night and it was still hot. Needless to say, we didn't sleep soundly. The next day, after returning from breakfast, the door would not open with our key card. We had to go downstairs for a new key card. That didn't work and had to go back downstairs to have the desk clerk try her key card. That didn't work. Then we had to wait on maintenance to come and fish underneath the door to pull the handle from inside, which took forever. Upon checkout, the desk clerk promised a room with a view upon our return later in the week. We returned and did get the promised room. However, later that night the toilet stopped up and no we didn't put anything that is not suppose to be in there. The next morning we went down for breakfast and the courtyard was full of people. There was no where to sit or stand. Most of the bread and fruits were almost gone and hadn't be restocked and there wasn't even a tray to put your food on. It was ridulous.

The staff was very nice and the room was more than enough to take my family of five. There is room service from their own restaurant with meals starting around $18 or several local places that will deliver which are listed on your room info cards. The hotel is located about 5 minutes from SFO (depending on traffic) and is located close enough to freeway for easy access but far enough that you dont need to blast the TV to drum out the sounds of traffic.

If i were staying there for pleasure, i would have reconsidered.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":2,"ratingHotelCondition":1,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"San Diego CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-05-25T05:07:36Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"42336","reviewId":"18257633","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Michael","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Busy place","reviewText":"Very busy and loud in the common areas, but WIFI was great and the place was beautiful","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Baltimore, MD","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-05-11T22:55:28Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"42336","reviewId":"18257593","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Igor","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Very Impressed","reviewText":"The hotel was great, would definitely stay there again.

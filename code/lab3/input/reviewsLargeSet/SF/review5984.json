We paid for the \"Bay View Room\" and while it was a view of the Bay, you had to stand at the window and crane your neck to see the bridge. This was in room 1107. If you want full bridge view, try requesting rooms 1115 through 1111. Those might have a more direct view. We didn't have a car, so relied on walking and the buses, both were super convenient. Having a car in the city is NOT convenient. \r\nI was not blown away by the breakfast. We only ate one breakfast. The offerings are of waffles, sausage patties, hot and cold cereals, egg pucks, bagels, hard boiled eggs, mini-yogurts, fruit, etc. I've had better at other Comfort Inns. If you're looking to save money on a meal, it will probably be okay for you. Our room had a fridge, but no microwave.\r\nI never felt unsafe walking to/from the hotel at night - it is in a really nice part of town. Lombard Street is literally right up the street from the entrance of the hotel.\r\n\r\nOverall, I was really impressed with the location and ease of getting from the hotel to the marina district. \r\nIf you're looking to be in Union Square, or Haight just know it will take you a good 45 minutes by bus to get to anywhere that is not the wharf. \r\nI recommend this hotel and would stay here again!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"Location!

I'm sure at one time this hotel was considered to be pretty nice. The staff was great, very helpful, friendly (always greeted us as we can in from an outing or just came down from our room).

We were on the 8th floor...only one elevator was working. Which meant at many times a wait of 5-10 minutes to get the elevator, and many times you had to wait 2 rounds to be able to fit on the elevator. Also, the restrooms on the main floor were \"out of order\"...so, it you had to use the restroom with eating breakfast, you had to wait 10 minutes for the elevator to take you up to your room...then another 5-10 to go back down.

Perfect.   The rooms are not overly fancy - but the rooms are clean and very comfortable with excellent beds.   It is about a $12 cab ride to Union Square and you can walk to the harbor.   It is a great location.   I had a room at the back of the hotel.  No fancy views but I can bet I had no traffic noise.   Having a view you look at for only short periods is not worth the expense if you can leave windows open during the night.   Parking is easy - but designed for when cars were smaller... so be careful but don't let that put you off using it.  Unlimited entry and exit thought out the day.. entrance is on Van Ness just before the intersection.   The staff as OK - they are not in any rush and fill there lives with made up policies... The Room Safe is one.  \"don't use it - leave the key in and we won't charge\" - then it is on my bill - \"oh they should have told you at check-in that you won't use so we stop the auto charge at check in\"  make up your mind!   Either way it takes over 5 minutes for them to reverse all the charges and taxes.   Just silly things like that that can get really annoying.\r\nWould I stay again?

Also, the parking was expensive, but cheaper than most other San Francisco hotels ($26+tax instead of $38-$40 charged by most hotels).

The staff were welcoming when we arrived late. They were helpful with directions on visits and looked after us well, arranging a shuttle to the airport at a fair price [$14.00 each], looking after our luggage after booking out. When the fog lifted we had a good view of the bridge and the breakfast was more than adequate. Our room was roomy, quiet and the beds were comfortable.\nWe have two suggestions for improvement. In most hotels of this standard there is an option to log on for those who don't bring a laptop, which is often free. We were told this was not an option and so could not book our flight on-line and ended up seated apart for 10 hours. No local internet shops were seen.\nAlthough the hotel was clean, all the white plates we saw were grubby looking and do need replacing. They were clean, or so it appeared, but totally covered with grey scratches on them that made it impossible to verify this. This was a quality own goal that could be remedied easily. Hopefully they were in their last week of service.\nOn balance the hotel was a good choice with excellent bus and cable car[1/2 mile] access, and was within walking distance of the Pier 39 area. Locally Union St shops offer a trendy option, and downtown is about 30 mins away by bus, as are the Golden Gate Park and Legion of Honour galleries. Shuttle takes about 1 1/2 hours in rush hour to the airport allowing for several pick ups - quite a good tour but allow enough time!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"The helpful staff","negativeRemarks":"Grubby plates at breakfast, and we think we are pretty relaxed about details....","locationRemarks":"Good access to most of the city in 30 mins","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Oxfordshire, UK","reviewSubmissionTime":"2012-11-03T16:44:47Z","roomTypeId":461618,"userDisplayName":"Bill and liz","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"3","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_gb","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5984","reviewId":"39914426","photos":[],"itinId":"13667942083","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"2057","userNickname":"Amo","brandType":"Expedia","title":"OK hotel, nice location","reviewText":"stayed three nights at this hotel, the bedding could have been better, the room was a little dated.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"within walking distance from fishermans wharf & the view of golden gate bridge from the beadroom!","negativeRemarks":"bedding could have been better","locationRemarks":"nice location, felt safe walking around the area at night.","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Leicester, UK","reviewSubmissionTime":"2012-11-01T22:17:14Z","roomTypeId":442884,"userDisplayName":"Amo","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5984","reviewId":"39386718","photos":[],"itinId":"151224062321","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":2,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"CP","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Did not live up to Comfort Inn standards at all.","reviewText":"Rude/unhelpful front desk staff.

I've stayed in countless hotels and the individuals I spoke with during check-in and check-out were by far the worst hotel front desk staff I've ever encountered. When I asked simple questions about the hotel they responded with irritation and were acting as if they were really busy when I was the only person in the lobby.\n\nThe woman that checked me in didn't mention any additional fees or a deposit that would be added to my card during the check in process. I had paid for my room online through Expedia so I thought that any other expenses would be minimal. Not only did they add a few random fees and taxes that looked odd on my final bill but they put a $100 deposit hold fee on my card as well. I've never had a hotel put this much of a deposit on my card without any mention of it during the reservation process or being told about it at check-in. Luckily I had additional funds in my checking account but if you are traveling on a budget this could really impact your stay in the city.\n\nThe stairwells smelled awful and without exaggeration could be compared to a mix of something between raw sewage and a really dirty locker room (you have to take the stairs from the parking garage to the lobby because there is no elevator on those levels).

Parking in a under ground parking lot that is a little snug to get in and out and it cost about 26.99 plus tax to park there, which they charge you when you check out and they don't guarantee that a parking spot will we be available is you take you car in and out throughout the day ( which is not right ...since you paying over 30 bucks to park there. But we left our car parked there, walked and took a cab everywhere. No complaints.

There wasn't any public internet access as listed in their services. The monitor has a dusty note scotch-taped to the screen. Breakfast supposedly ends at 9:30 a.m. but the staff is busy taking away food at 9 a.m. There is hardly enough seating and food too even if you arrive at 7:00 a.m. Also the fare offered had nothing healthy to choose from except if you count a mountain of hard-boiled eggs and stale apples. No bananas or yogurt? The hotel is adequate and no frills, which is fine but the breakfast situation really turned me off and we stayed there for 8 days, and it was always the same. Then to have a nerve to try to charge 2 dollars a day for use of the room-safe, when it wasn't used because we didn't see one put me off from honestly recommending this place.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"New York, NY","reviewSubmissionTime":"2007-08-27T17:13:23Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"Dave","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5984","reviewId":"18534944","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Niels","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Comfort Inn By The Bay - good place to stay","reviewText":"We stayed in this hotel for 4 nights (6-10 august), after having booked it through expedia.

After getting there (a few right turns equal a left ;) ), check in was a breeze. Parking isn't cheap, at $26 + tax per night, but hey, at least the car's in a secure parking structure. You're not guaranteed a parking spot, but we had no trouble finding one. The room was very nice, with 2 beds, and a view of the bay. The Golden Gate bridge, while not exactly nearby, could be clearly seen from our room. Very nice. There's some traffice noise, but nothing disturbing. Breakfast was really nice, with DIY waffles, cereal (hot/cold), fruit, bagels, juice, coffee/tea, etc. Seating can be a problem, as there aren't enough places for everyone to sit. The hotel is located perfectly for just about any daily activity - walking distance from Fisherman's Wharf, close by a bus stop for going a bit farther away.

However, if you are driving there is a $20 fee per day plus tax for parking and there is no way to park on the street for more than 2 hours. Continental breakfast was really dull. The Front Desk people were less than friendly. The room was ok, but the bathroom was not very functional (the toilet), plus the people who cleaned it apparently were loosing their hair, because we found many of those around.

I had to do a \"5 point turn\" to get out of registration. Good luck manuveuring if you drive an SUV or large car.  You must use steps to get from the parking area to the lobby and then take an elevator to the room.  This is difficult if you are trying to avoid the 5 point turn at the registration area when you check out (you will need to shlep your luggage down the steps).  This also makes the place unfriendly for disabled.  The maid left us a 1/2 empty bottle of shampoo.  I thought that was tacky.  They would be better off not even putting shampoo in the room.  The room was quieter than some hotels in San Francisco and we could see the Golden Gate Bridge off to the side.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":2,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Lake Arrowhead,Ca.","reviewSubmissionTime":"2004-11-18T07:00:09Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"5984","reviewId":"18535010","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Peter","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Comfort Inn by the Bay is in a great location for the leisure traveler.","reviewText":"Great value considering the high prices of hotels in San Francisco.

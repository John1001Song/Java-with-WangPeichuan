Next to it is a sign that says: $X/hour, $YY/day to even enter the lot.\r\n\r\nThe cost was higher before we even checked in.  That, to me, is RIDICULOUSLY deceptive.  It's located very close to the airport, with tightly controlled areas all about (razor wire) so it was about 4 blocks away when we found a parking spot, we timed it, an 11 minute walk away.  Took less time to drive to the airport than to get to our car from the hotel.\r\n\r\nIt was a mostly new facility.  Clean.  Nice colors and very refreshing design.  For the advertised price, it was an OK deal, and very conveniently located.  For the actual cost with parking, I would not have chosen it, it would be far above the acceptable price.\r\n\r\nThe staff was mostly clueless though: they didn't understand or even acknowledge or want to discuss there was a problem arriving to find out the rate was a full **ZZ% higher** than I'd agreed.  They said, \"we allow a 15 minute grace period to check in, for free.\"  I did not see that on any sign when trying to enter, but that wasn't even the point.  You're trapped there and either pay the extra or park 4 blocks away.\r\n\r\nI've replaced all reference to the actual costs, percentages and prices with XX YY and ZZ, (per Expedia policy preventing reviews with prices).

The shower has a fold down seat and bars for those with mobility issues.  The shower also has wall dispensers for body wash and a 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner.

The door to the bathroom is a sliding door instead of a regular door, and on the bathroom side of the door is a large full-length mirror.\r\n\r\nWe stayed in a room with a king-size bed and pillows that were very comfortable (we slept well).  The air conditioner in the room worked well and was quiet, and it is controlled by an actual thermostat on the wall which is nice.  There were plenty of outlets so we had no problems trying to find free outlets to charge our phones and camera batteries.  The curtains in the room are controlled electronically which was pretty cool.  The room also had a small refrigerator, but it was located in the bathroom which was kinda weird.  No big deal though.

Nice. On our first night the front desk clerk, was not very pleasant. My husband last minute needed to change the stay and take off 1 night, she said it was not refundable because we paid up front. We didn't argue...so please make sure your plans are final, they will not change things. We did not fight it, we just dealt with it. There is only ONE set of elevators and 1 elevator was not operating. Very inconvenient that you had to walk all the way down halls (maze like) to get to the elevator. It has a very \"night club\" type feeling to it, and we were traveling with my two young sons. (ages 6 and 4), like I said it's pretty. I definitely would say not \"family friendly\". Breakfast is ridiculously over priced to eat there. If you stay...only bring cold food items to your fridge, no microwave. The hotel was cleaned once when we arrived. When maids came, they only made the beds, and put fresh towels. Bed was comfy, oh and I was surprised to find a \"sex\" magazine in our room.

The room was just right and the bathroom was wonderful ... great design, lighting and layout. And THE TOWELS! They were a tad rough, BUT they were the best smelling towels I have every experienced in a hotel ... I did not have to hold my breath to dry off. Last, I did not use these facilities, but the pool and exercise room looked good.\n\nMy only constructive criticism would be 1) that when checking in, it is important that one be told how to use the room card for the elevator. I have seen this security measure before and it is good, but when I first used it, the elevator is quite dark, it took a few minutes to realize I was standing still. This also may be made age kicking in. And 2) the signage is not clear in the self serve food area how one gets there hot food. My first thought was that they were all out of the hot stuff.

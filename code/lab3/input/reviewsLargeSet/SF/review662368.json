When I arrived there was a bellman who offered me a cold wash cloth to freshen up. There was no line at the front desk because they had three people there so check in was a breeze. The room was super clean, bathroom great, shower pressure strong, and as a business traveler I really appreciated the free wifi in the room (it was an upraded room) and all the electrical outlets that were conveniently placed at the side of the desk. The bed was extremely comfortable and I liked that they gave you 4 pillows, 2 firm and 2 soft, so you could choose the ones you prefer. The room was quiet so I got a good night's sleep. I forgot my phone charger but I called the front desk and they loaned me one for the night (with a $20 deposit - no big deal because I'm sure they lose a lot of them otherwise). My only slight cautionary word is they have no gift shop or place to buy sundries so if you need something you'll have to go out of the hotel. Not a great inconvenience because there a lot of stores near the hotel but if you need something quick it would be nice to have a gift and sundry shop.

There was a comb full of hair, and bottle caps stuck between our mattress and the head board. I found it because I always check every hotel I stay at for bedbugs. There were also a pair of false eyelashes on the floor next to the bed. Makes me wonder if they vacuum at all. Everything in the room costs money to consume. Two bottles of water 7.50 each! 15.00 for water? Drinking glasses were next to the bathroom sink, not wrapped in plastic, not very sanitary. Be aware that in this day and age they charge for the basic necessity of wi-fi, 14.95 a day. TV remote did not work unless you were literally 2 inches from the TV. And this is the second time we have stayed here and both times the room was not very clean and TV remote did not work well. The only reason we stayed again was that I got an excellent deal so we thought we would give it a second chance. I won't stay here again. They have a shower curtain in the bathroom which is very \"Best Western\" looking. Something else very disgusting was that there were long black hairs found on our pillow cases when we opened the bed to check it. \r\nThe positive: Room air conditioning was quiet and they must have put an air freshener in it because it smelled good whenever it came on.

A knock on the door came and it was security demanding that we open the door.  We refused because we were startled and unsure why he would be knocking on our door.  He again demanded that we open the door.  He proceeded to tell us that there was a complaint with our noise level.  There was no television on and no radio on...just the occupants talking. I would think that a hotel of this caliber and price would have a different approach to addressing a noise level aside from sending a rude security officer. This security guard was beyond rude and we asked to be moved since apparently the occupants with the dog were bothered.

It is centrally located and along a trolley route which makes it pretty easy to get around the city.  Trolley bells were really the only noise we heard at night and it was quite peaceful.  Just be prepared that everything around the hotel closes early so you'll have to travel a bit to get food or entertainment.  Surprisingly, hotel was kid-friendly.  I took my 5 year old daughter and she was greeted with a kids travel backpack with goodies at the hotel.  We also received milk and cookies every night!  My one complaint (more Expedia's fault than the Omni's) is that Expedia described this hotel as having a pool.  It does not.  That was a big disappointment for my daughter.  But to the hotel's credit, they called around to find a hotel which would sell us a day pass to their pool and we were able to go swimming.

The biggest problem is the housekeeping staff. They have not been properly trained and so we had daily problems such as used cups not being replaced by clean ones; new plastic liners were not put into the ice bucket; surfaces were not wiped clean of dust; tea bags were not replaced; though we had a quiet sign on our door but the housekeepers talked so much and so loudly in the hallway that I had to get out of bed to ask them to speak more quietly; there was one bathrobe, not two, in the closet, and that one was not clean; etc. The room service staff also needs some training. We ordered breakfast and we didn't get the right silverware. Aside from the housekeeping and room service staff, there were a couple of expenses we felt were excessive. We were charged $13 for a single bag of M&M's taken from the snack cupboard. The in-room movies are $15 per and the water bottles are $7.50. On the positive side, the hotel is beautiful; the rest of the staff - doorman, front desk, etc. - were all terrific in every way; the room was very comfortable, sunny and pleasingly furnished, and the location of the hotel is perfect for walking to countless restaurants, museums, and other city adventures.

The lobby is so beautiful and the staff so welcoming that we did not for a moment remember the state that we arrived in - we were just in awe (to put in a reference here we paid less than friends did for their room at the Hilton on Kearny and their experience was only a fraction as good as ours). The room was ready early for us, just like we asked, and are they ever gorgeous rooms. Definitely sign up to their club membership as you get free Wi-Fi, coffees delivered in the morning at your choice of time, welcome waters, turn down service (and the list goes on). I was looking for something slightly out of union square area to avoid Christmas traffic, the area was mostly quiet after hours so you could get a reasonable sleep, beds were comfortable, choice of pillows. Bathrooms were incredible with marble. Oh, and bathrobes in the closet. Hairdryer, absolutely everything you could want! Only a few blocks out of main tourist area, definitely worth the stay.

There are regular trams however to take you up and down the steep hills (as seen on TV) and they are an experience in themselves. The local people are friendly and helpful if you want to know any directions or which trams to catch and the local transport service BART (Bay Area Rapid Transport) has several stations which are easy to travel to based on the information given on the maps provided at all stations.

They sent us up a bottle of champagne when they found out it was our honeymoon. It's in the financial district so a lot of big buildings, not immediate view, but we were on the 15th floor and able to look out past the buildings and see the fog over the bay. It wasn't noisy. We slept like logs. The hotel is beautiful, didn't eat or drink at the attached restaurant/bar but locals said it was a great place for a steak and it always seemed to have people in it. Seemed classy but not stuffy. Comfy bed. Close to Chinatown, North beach/Italian neighborhood, Fisherman's Wharf, Embarcadero. We took the BART to the airport, got off at the Montgomery Street stop and walked a few blocks - very easy. Never felt unsafe in this area. We stayed Mon-Fri so I never saw the neighborhood on the weekend but I read reviews that the immediate area \"shuts down\" due to being in financial district?

This is a fabulous hotel with a great location around the corner from the Trans Am building, on the cable-car line and within one to three blocks of about 6 Starbucks (if that is your pleasure). Room and bathroom were all updated and brightly lit!\n\nFor breakfast you can also choose Cafe Venue (2 blocks and down an alley). Across the street and 1 block is La Boulange (fabulous Fr. bakery for BKFST or lunch) both only open M-F . . . After all this is the financial district! Cafe is 'you order, you pick up'. La B is also 'you order' but they deliver.\n\nWe had a wonderful dinner at Cafe Claude. The concierge made our reservation-3 block walk. Claude also has two other places on this alley-all three are worth the walk. On our last night\nwe ate at the hotel in Bob's Steak and Chop -yum!\n\nIf you dare to blend with the tourists and find yourselves down at Pier 39, do have lunch or dinner at Fog Harbor up on the second level . . . Window seat preferred. Very nicely appointed, white linens, fine china and crystal, and good service . . . A big step ahead of the other tourist eateries on level one.\n\nThis was our first stay at an Omni and we will definitely stay at others during our travels. They are service orientated and soon you practically feel like family. We are doing a 16 day trip around CA and upon our return to Frisco to catch a 'red-eye' the Omni will be storing our luggage while we drop off our city rental and kill some time.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"Location and service","negativeRemarks":"None","locationRemarks":"See above","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Beaufort, SC","reviewSubmissionTime":"2013-06-08T02:12:51Z","roomTypeId":200020668,"userDisplayName":"Carol","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"662368","reviewId":"53233283","photos":[],"itinId":"156761755108","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Kim","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great location!","reviewText":"The hotel staff was very friendly and always happy to help.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"For San Francisco, the location is great.

This time I spent a week. I give it 5's across the board. I am 6'4\" tall and I liked the high ceilings in the rooms as well as the nice high shower head and high shower curtain rod. The hotel has all of the \"little things\" down pretty well. The towel rods were all nice an solid. In some hotels you feel like you have to be careful hanging a towel lest the rod fall off the wall. Not the case at all with the Omni, nice, solid, well-anchored fixtures. And the lighting in the bathroom was good; as was the lighting in the room itself. In some hotels you either feel like the bathroom is a dark cave or else it takes five minutes for the lights to warm up to where you can see enough to shave in the morning. Not the Omni - good and bright as soon as you hit the switch. And none of those super-dim bulbs in the lamps either, nice, bright bulbs there too. The curtains did a great job of shutting out the exterior light when it was time to sleep. I got no street noise, but I had a courtyard? view (i.e. not street). And the staff was great! Very friendly and helpful when I checked in and the concierge did a great job of giving me a lot of options for a quick one-evening of playing tourist. Would I recommend it to a friend? Only as long as I were not travelling during the same time period. If there was any danger of my \"friend\" taking the last room then I'd tell him to go find his own hotel and let me have the Omni.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"Good lighting","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"Very good for where I was conducting my business.","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Kansas City, MO, USA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2013-03-19T20:42:28Z","roomTypeId":335961,"userDisplayName":"Greg","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"BusinessTravelers","categoryLabel":"BusinessTravelers"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"662368","reviewId":"49189204","photos":[],"itinId":"155236811953","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Immaculate, friendly & great location","reviewText":"Absolutely amazing.

Both of these turned out in my favor. I ended up not even using the free Wi-Fi but they gave us care packages for the kids which included nightly cookies and milk, and we got some strawberries on our anniversary date. We also took advantage of the morning delivery of coffee and orange juice that didn't cost us anything.\nThe location could not have been better. We were close by everything we wanted to see. We stayed over a weekend so for the most part the neighborhood was quiet, I'm guessing because it's the financial district. Our room was on the 15th floor so outside noise was never a problem. I didn't hear any of the other hotel guests either.\nI can't think of anything negative to say about this hotel. Everything was great-service, location, value....I would definitely stay here again.\nI guess the only thing I could possibly gripe about is paying $102 plus \"city parking tax\" for three nights of parking.

First time I was extremely busy in the city I didn't pay much attention to my lodging for I just came there to crush and be the first person in the morning to leave, but I did notice the overall nice interior of the hotel and very good location. The second time I came to SF for a weekend, I picked Omni remembering that I was satisfied with my previous experience. There was no rush, and I could actually take a closer look at my accommodations and enjoy them. To my unpleasant surprise I did not like what I saw. First of all, the walls in the hotel are made of paper, and the staff is outrageously discourteous. Starting at 6 am, \"housekeeping!\" and \"mini bar!\" rushes into the hallway slamming every possible door on their way. So if you're an early riser, even during weekends, then this hotel's feature might not bother you too much. Another disturbing nuance is hotel's in-room WiFi which, at this age of wireless freedom everywhere, is not free. It's $9.95 per day. And it's not that big of a deal, really, except that it is absolutely not working! I don't mind being charged a reasonable fee for internet, but I do, surprisingly, expect it to work.

We felt like royalty the whole time we were there - every time we passed by the front desk or concierge, they were smiling and checking that we were happy (we were). They recommended a couple of excellent restaurants to us. The housekeeping staff left us nice personal handwritten notes just saying that it was a pleasure to help us and thanking us graciously for the tips we left them! Fresh orchids in the bathroom were beautiful. Doormen were among the most attentive and friendliest I have met, running to be sure they got the door for us and always with a friendly \"welcome back!\" As we departed, we mentioned we needed a cab to the airport. The doorman put us in a limo for the same cost as the cab and gave us a hug as we left!

The location was convenient and central to the downtown area. The beds and pillows were comfortable. The staff was friendly. The staff left cookies and milk for the kids each night we were there. The kids also got goody bags when they got to the hotel.\n\nA couple of negatives for me were that the room seemed a bit cramped for me. Maybe it's just because it's a San Francisco hotel. I'm not familiar with the other hotels there, so not sure of the sizes of the rooms in the other hotels. Also this was a room that was supposed to have 2 queen beds which I felt weren't queen, but regular sized. Finally, like most other hotels, I felt the menu was very over priced. We ate breakfast there in our final morning there. We ordered 3 kiddie meals and 1 adult meal. The portions weren't at all too large, if anything very edible.

Things just continued well from there.\n- My daughter was given a welcome pack full of toys which kept her amused throughout the three nights we stayed (thanks to a bit of rationing).\n- They sent up cookies and milk to the room every evening (supposedly for my daughter but enough for us too)\n- There was fresh fruit in reception every day\n- They remembered my daughter's name and said hello every time we passed the front desk.\n- When my wife unfortunately fell ill and needed treatment (nothing to do with the hotel) they were incredibly helpful and understanding and checked in regularly to see if they could help in any way.\nIn short, this was the best hotel I think I've ever stayed in despite being nowhere near as expensive as others I've tried.

Not only is it a fabulous location, close walk to Union Square and shopping, Farmer's Market at the Pier, Chinatown and Little Italy, but the staff there could not have been friendlier or more helpful. Public transport is right outside the door to take you to Fisherman's Wharf or wherever, and tour buses stop there and drop you back off! We felt very safe wherever we walked. The room was tastefully decorated, luxurious and quiet. The white robes were lovely. Best of all the parking was quite reasonable compared to many other less expensive hotels in less desirable locations - and the valet parking was very efficient! When we called for our car and they asked for our stub, we couldn't remember where we put it 3 days earlier. We tore through our suitcases/bags/purse and finally did find it. However, when we went downstairs to give them the stub - they had already retrieved the car and it was there waiting for us. I loved the whole experience and would go back in a second.

It was like heaven after a trip in the national parks staying in cabins & low end motels.\n\nThe location is good too - San Francisco is compact enough that we found you can walk to many attractions from here (as long as you are reasonably fit to manage the hills), unlike LA which is too spread out to walk. The cable car goes right past the door, but at $5 a ride don't rely on it for your primary transport.\n\nThe only complaints I would have are that there is no exhaust fan in the bathroom (a bit embarassing if you make a smell because it goes through the whole room), and there is no guest laundry.\n\nNo guest laundry is a problem I encountered at several decent hotels in the US. It's frustrating when on a long trip. Invariably they offer a laundry service, but starting at $3:50 for a pair of underpants, who can afford to use it? Sitting in a public coin laundry during the day is a waste of sightseeing time, and walking to one at night isn't always an appealing option. Streets that feel safe by day seem less so at night and in all US big cities there seem to be plenty of homeless people even in \"nice\" areas of the city.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Brisbane, Australia","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-01-29T23:52:38Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"662368","reviewId":"17977579","photos":[],"itinId":"304904282","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Suzanne","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great hotel.","reviewText":"We were very impressed with the hospitality at this hotel.

Pros: Staff friendly & helpful Very upscale hotel Special small ammenities here and there Trolley passes right by the hotel Hotel provides a lot of useful information about local attractions for both adults & children You can purchase (trolley)Muni passes at the desk at $11 for a full day of unlimited rides. Kid friendly hotel! You can ask for a backpack full of activities for the kids to play with in the room. Cons: Billed over $100 for valet parking for only 2 night stay (there is no other parking, you pretty much have to valet) Financial district location not very good, dining is far unless you want to spend over $120 for a family of four at the hotel retaurant. Other restaurants are pretty far and local eateries are closed during the weekend because no one is working. Hotel more aimed for a business stay due to location.

So, the shower was perfect! The bathroom was beautiful. The restaurant in the lobby (Bob's Steaks & Chops) was pricey, but fantastic. Great service, and one of the best steaks I've had.

The only thing I would mention is that if you don't hold a credit card, they immediately take money from your debit card for incidentals -which is no problem. However, you may have some trouble getting the balance credited back to your account - what should have taken \"up to 72 hours\", took 10 days, following phone calls & emails!

The Doorman, receptionists, valets were friendly and helpful. The baggage handler filled our ice bucket for us after unloaded our luggage and called room service to order champagne and flutes for us. The staff made many dinner recommendations, and secured us a difficult-to-obtain, last-minute reservation at Ozumo's. I had a flat tire, and the front desk called AAA for me and arranged assistance on my behalf. The location couldn't be better. We walked through Chinatown, North Beach, up Lombard and down to the Wharf. But, for those not wanting to walk, the trolley runs right in front of the hotel.

Even though the cable cars are nearby I loved walking the town it is really an easy and exhilarating walk to just about anywhere in the city. One exceptionally stormy night we took advantage of the town car service offered by the hotel and was impressed with their accommodating attitude, and even less expensive than a local taxi. The concierge recommended some fabulous restaurants and we lucked upon some great ones as well. Come to think of it is hard not to find a great restaurant in North beach, China-Town, and the Pier area.

To add insult to injury sometimes it would take more than 20 minutes for the valet to bring your car around.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Kansas City","reviewSubmissionTime":"2005-06-01T18:53:14Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"662368","reviewId":"17977884","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Elaine","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Wonderful attention to detail","reviewText":"The Omni San Francisco is a lovely hotel, and we will stay there again.

I ordered room service five times and was impressed each time with the presentation, quality, and taste of the food. The only thing I though was a little off key, were the prices of the items in the room's snack bar. Although similar to other hotels, I think the pricing is rediculously high. An example is a 10oz diet Coke - $4.50. I went out and bought a 12 pack for $3.99. Not sure where they're going with this, but I can assure you the products do not more that fast, which questions how fresh they are.

(You're in San Francisco. Bring good walking shoes!) Feinstein's at the Nikko was a huge surprise--heard Minnie Driver (actress, singer, songwriter) perform a beautiful set in this very intimate 140 seat cabaret club.

Before you book the Unpublished hotel service they list the features and general location of the secret hotel, we liked the features it offered (leisure facilities, internet, star rating etc).  So we booked it and hoped for the best.  Obviously we were given Hotel Nikko, but what hadn't been made clear was that even though the hotel had these \"features\" available they were mostly at an additional charge.  This is sneaky in my opinion. Secondly we booked a room for two people and we were given a \"petite queen\" room.  I emailed the hotel and asked what this meant exactly.  The response was a room ideal for one person but could fit a second.  By this point I was pretty mad as accommodation is not cheap in this city and I felt cheated.\r\n\r\nI emailed both Expedia and the hotel and asked for an explanation.  For this I would mark Expedia 1/5 as they did absolutely nothing to help.

We paid $50 extra per night to have our dog here and she has no where to go?  Also, they told us once arriving only that she is not allowed to be left alone in a crate, so we couldn't go out for dinner or anything.  The hotel has restaurants and bars, but none with a patio where our dog could join us.  So, we were stuck with their terrible tasting and grossly overpriced room service.

Very close to Union Square, and the cable car stop at Powell.  Bus, tram and BART train stops were near by too, which made getting around town very easy.  \r\n\r\nI thought the hotel was very much on the expensive side, particularly when compared to other places I've stayed in both in the US or elsewhere in the world - 5 star prices, but wasn't a 5 star hotel; don't know whether this is a feature of San Francisco. i.e. is it an expensive city, or whether we just had picked a busy time of the year to visit.  There was a huge conference going on in town, which could have affected room prices. \r\n\r\nOur room  was on the small side, and a bit noisy - although we were 12 floors up, we could hear noise coming up from the street, and not just traffic - could hear voices at night, which made sleeping difficult.  On the plus side, we were given complimentary access to one of their executive lounges, which provided a continental breakfast.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"Location.","negativeRemarks":"Better sound proofing or better window glazing.","locationRemarks":"Close to Union Square & Cable car stop.","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Liverpool, UK","reviewSubmissionTime":"2014-10-22T19:43:02Z","roomTypeId":14738,"userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}]},{"isRecommended":"NO","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"hotelId":"23406","reviewId":"10000895644","photos":[],"itinId":"188953186075","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"PD","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":2,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Michael","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Low value for money, lack of integrity","reviewText":"I chose their best room available, paid $400 and got an average room and they simply said I'm not entited to the breakfast buffet that was part of what I purchased via Expedia.

In the past they have upgraded our room at no charge and sometimes sent a bottle of champaigne to the room. We also used to get a room that had a couch (for our child to sleep on) at no extra charge. Now those rooms are way more expensive. The last two times we have stayed there our room did not have a couch for our child to sleep on. They just do not take care of us the way they used to or offer the extra's that made us loyal to them in the first place. We no longer get what we pay for with the higher priced room. The bell service is the best part of the stay. They greet you every time you come in or leave...opening doors, offering to flag a taxi for you, carry your bags etc. I feel like the bell service was the best part of our stay.

I would compare this hotel to a Hilton or other major hotel chain. They charge you for everything such as WIFI and access to the pool and gym BUT I would recommend this over a Hilton. Check in was prompt, staff seemed happy although I asked for almost nothing. The hotel it's self could probably use a little updating especially in the common areas but it was by no means shabby. The rooms are very clean and have a modern touch to them. Great showers even though they spray water a bit on the bathroom floor (I don't care because I'm not the one cleaning it). Major props though to the power toilet though. I can't believe I am saying it but the toilet was the highlight of the hotel. It is basically a toilet with a bidet built into or onto it. Not a normal European bidet mind you but rather a bidet on steroids as only Japanese could imagine or invent. Heated seat, variable pressure, position, water temp, oscillating function, self cleaning type of bidet. I looked this thing up and it retails between $600 and $1000 so the fact this was in a standard queen size room was pretty cool. I stayed on the 20th floor and had a partial view of the Bay Bridge and Tenderloine area. Only complaint was that the hotel pool was undergoing renovations which the atrium pool was the primary reason I booked this hotel (oh and they would have charged a $20 fee to even use it I found out) so we could not use the pool.

The only reason I couldn't give a complete 5 star review is because the little things that really added up by the end of our stay. Wi-fi is extra per day, and there is a fee for the pool and gym area, albeit a one time fee. There was a bottle of water on the table in the room, I naively thought is was complimentary and drank it. It was not free. Also, just moving something to make room in the minibar/fridge for something is an automatic charge. I ended up racking up a couple charges accidentally.

Beautiful and modern, with a clear Japanese inspiration. The staff were incredibly polite and attentive, they responded to our needs quickly, and provided us with anything we requested. The price seems right for the standard of the hotel, though the area leaves a lot to be desired. Although we could walk to the War Memorial Opera House within 20 minutes from the hotel, the streets did seem pretty sketchy and I wouldn't have felt safe walking at night by myself. So definitely a cab is necessary. Also, you have to pay for the overnight parking, which seems excessive since you are already paying quite a bit of money to stay in the hotel to begin with.\nThe bar and restaurant were phenomenal, and the array of food for the breakfast buffet was ample. We upgraded to the Imperial suites on the 23rd floor, with its own lounge serving complimentary wine and cheese. The spread here wasn't too impressive, but it came included with the room upgrade.\nThis is a good hotel to stay for a night, maybe two.

We did not visit the breakfast buffet either, which seemed a little pricey. We would definitely stay there again. Thanks to Ernesto, the concierge, for a great restaurant referral to Fog Harbour at Pier 39 - terrific meal and lovely restaurant. He also set us up with their preferred double decker tour, Big Bus, which seemed the best of all the available options, although we preferred the audio tour to the live guides, if truth be told. Good general tour route - didn't hit all the high spots, but most.\n\nThe large homeless population in the area is sad to see, but not any reflection on the hotel itself.

It is nice and clean, but I definitely recommend staying elsewhere even if it is a little downgraded because it's probably still as nice and clean. They charge an extra $20 per room, per day just to use the gym/health club, pool and spa. It is an extra $15.50 just to get WiFi in your room.

Also, upon check-in, I was specifically told by the front desk lady that my credit card would not have any holds on it (meaning they would not temporarily remove money from it, for security reasons) at all; however, when I came home there was a $150 hold on my card. She didn't seem knowledgeable at all because I also asked her if our room would have a separate bath and shower and she said no, but it did (which was nice, but still...unhelpful staff).

I could barely hear people in the other rooms, which is good for privacy. The decor is modern/ Japanese and is very classy. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The staff was very friendly and helpful. There is complimentary lemon and orange water in the lobby. The major downside was the cost to use many amenities. There is a $20 (per day I think) fee to use to pool and fitness center. You also have to pay for internet use. Also, do not remove any item from the refridgerator unless you want to pay for it. It will automatically charge you if something is moved, but they are happy to remove the accidental charges if you do not use something. It is in a great location though.

However, if you walk in the other direction you walk right into the homeless-covered streets of the Tenderloin. The hotel itself is very clean, the staff is friendly, the beds are covered in comfortable pillows, but the rooms are little on the small side (expected in the middle of SF). The amenities provided are really what keep Hotel Nikko from being a great hotel. There is wireless internet (which you have to pay for per day and per device) is TERRIBLE. There is a fee to use the gym, a fee to use the pool, a fee for basically everything beyond use of the bed and soap in the bathroom. As a general room, if you are looking for a standard hotel amenity that you would expect from a nice hotel (i.e. gym, pool, wireless internet, flexible check-out times...) this hotel has it (except for the flexible check-out time), but you will have to pay extra for it.

This is our first time to stay in a hotel in San Francisco so I do not have other hotels to compare it to. We stayed before in another Nikko in Dusseldorf, and I had the same comment about the size of the room for the price we paid. I wonder if the owners were thinking they're building the hotels in Tokyo. Overall, we had a wonderful stay as the staff were very friendly and our room was very clean with a partial view of the water and the bridge. Location is superb for shopping and dining.The buffet breakfast was nice to have included, though one can get a room excluding breakfast. If you had to pay, you will spend $60 for two. Ouch!

The main choices for location were Union Square vs Fisherman's Wharf. Since our kids are teenagers we opted for Union Square. This hotel is very conveniently situated, being close to the Powell/Market Street Cable Car terminus and one of the major shopping areas of SF. Apple Store, Gap, Banana Republic and a massive Westfield Shopping Centre are all within a few minutes walk. The hotel room itself was stylish and kept very clean. We had a deal via Expedia for a room with two queen sized beds, and the hotel graciously provided a rollaway bed. For $20 extra we got access to the pool and gym during our stay, which for the 4 of us was good value. It was strange that Wi-Fi was not included ($16 per day extra) or that there wasn't an option to buy a few days worth of wifi access at a special price eg $50 for 5 days. This is probably because this hotel is more geared towards business than family customers. Breakfast is also an expensive add-on, but as others have commented there are plenty of places to buy breakfast and get wi-fi access. There is space in the room fridge for milk and yoghurt. Unlike some other reviewers, we found the reception staff to be very helpful.

The service was excellent. The rooms were beautifully decorated and spotless. The bathroom was huge and had very beautiful fixtures. The elevators were extremely fast. The Starbucks in the hotel was open extended hours and had free wifi. We thought we were going to use the spa and fitness centre but unfortunately ran out of time. There was a $10 cost to have access but I would have paid that if time permitted.\n\nThe minibar was full of items to purchase and if you pulled anything out of it you were automatically billed for the item. We were not tempted at those prices but I would be worried if I would have had small children with me. We wanted to chill some beverages so the hotel actually wheeled a little fridge into our room for us to use.\n\nIf I could make a suggestion to the Hotel Nikko it would be to offer free internet in their business centre.

I cannot penalize the hotel for such a small issue as it truly was an excellent hotel.\n\nOverall we were extremely pleased with the Hotel Nikko and would definately stay there again.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Canada","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-06-13T20:26:04Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"23406","reviewId":"17985074","photos":[],"itinId":"371532723","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Al","brandType":"Expedia","title":"SF hotel","reviewText":"We always check the price on the Nikko first when headed for San Francisco.

Front desk very friendly. Room was very nice and fairly roomy according to SF standards. Had 2 queen beds that were super comfy with great quality linens. Nice bathroom with a large counter. We were in San Fran for the Nike Women's Marathon and had requested a fridge for drinks be in room on arrival and it was. Nighttime is quite noisy but that's SanFran, not sure how you would get around that staying right in the city. Hotel located acrossed the street had employees picketing and that started first thing in the morning, so if you weren't awake you would be once they arrived with their blowhorn. Hotel is in a great location to Union Square and other city activities. We were able to do mega shopping and come back to hotel unload, rest and go at it again. Ran the beautiful course of the SF Marathon on a rainy Sunday and used the hotel hottub to relax. It was fairly chilly and another guest called maintenance who came immediately and fixed the temperature. Can't say that the hottub/pool area is really anything to rave about as the hottub is quite old, but it was wonderful to be able to soak our aching muscles!

At check-in our room wasn't ready and we were given an immediate upgrade. The king size bed and glass walled shower with separate tub was nice addition. Internet access in room and at the business centre was far too expensive. Hotel staff were helpful, the concierge typically had a line-up of 3 to 4 people waiting to ask questions. However, staff didn't go out of their way to be overly welcoming or friendly. Pool and gym facilities were a nice addition ($10 charge for use was waived) and not too busy. Room service menu was pricey, especially with added \"delivery\" and gratuity charges. The airport shuttle - an outside company arranged by the hotel - didn't show-up for our trip to the airport, but a taxi was readily available and only slightly more expensive.

But when I stay in a 4-star hotel, I expect exceptional hospitality. Nikko's hospitality is not exceptional, and here's why:\n\n1) They neglected to ask me about the hotel pool charge when I checked in, so when I went to the pool with guests, I couldn't access the pool. Had to walk downstairs (in my pool robe) to authorize a charge for $10. Obviously it was super important to \"observe\" procedure since they had me sign on what looked like the back of a napkin. 2) HOTEL FRIDGE - took (3) hours to get someone to empty out the hotel fridge so I could store champagne, etc. that I brought for my bday weekend. I asked them - can you make sure I don't get charged for all this? They said, sure. One week later I'm reading my credit card statement, and SUPRISE! Yep, they charged me for the ENTIRE contents of hotel fridge ($212.00). Ouch. 3) I requested a king size bed and they gave me (2) doubles. No biggie, but they weren't apologetic about it either. 4) Counters were dirty - I found old food stains. Yuck.\n\nOverall, nice hotel - really great swimming pool/jacuzzi/steam/sauna. Hospitality needs improvement. Nikko take note: Take the time to scrub down the rooms before you cram more people inside.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":1,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Central Coast, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-09-22T15:28:00Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Other","categoryLabel":""}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"23406","reviewId":"17984812","photos":[],"itinId":"328022075","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Renee","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Mixed bag","reviewText":"Not a bad hotel overall but the staff there is pretty unfriendly.

It is unfortunate that our experience was not as wonderful as our last Nikko stay. We were there celebrating our 26th and I saved the card from our last trip of the contact to write to if returning to make our next stay as delightful. I emailed that contact via the hotel website and never received any correspondence back nor any recognition at the front desk when arriving. Most importantly, when offered the fitness/pool/spa for an additional charge & we accepted, we were never told that it was going to be used by Hilton Hotel guests as their pool and spa facility was closed due to remodeling. We were sadly disappointed each time we went to use it that it was overcrowded with Hilton guests and mostly children in the spa unsupervised. We think it proper that we should have been informed of such on check-in. Why should Nikko guests be charged for this ammenity when Hilton guests were not? Not good etiquette for us. Also, our next door guests were extremely noisy from 11pm until 3am the 1st night and then the 2nd night started again at 2am. When we called the front desk, they immediately responded and took care of it. At best we learned, not to be so patient with noisy neighbors in an expensive hotel. The hotel offered us only 1/2 of our upgrade costs for 2 nights of lost sleep.\n\nThe sushi restaurant is costly but good. Happy Hour food is a bargain and service always exceptional.\n\nWe will not choose the Nikko for future stays.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Temecula, CA","reviewSubmissionTime":"2010-07-21T21:36:08Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"23406","reviewId":"17985705","photos":[],"itinId":"322769488","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Cindy","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Happy with the Nikko!","reviewText":"Great, great, great!

The bathroom separates the hallway from the sleeping area and the walls are very well insulated. We never heard any conversations or music. During our 2 nights of stay, we heard maybe 1-2 very dull thumps from someone dropping something on the floor above us. It was wonderful for our small children who are light sleepers. The indoor pool was a lifesaver since it rained during our stay. We drove into the city and were able to check in our luggage with the bellman until our room was ready. We opted to park at the Mason O'Farrell Garage which is basically catty-corner to the hotel. This saved us parking $$ and we didn't have to haul our luggage from the parking garage to the hotel. The hotel was very conveniently located. We had a great easy day taking the Muni out to Golden Gate park. Will go back to Hotel Nikko in a heart beat.

The initial room I was given looked nothing like the pictures and did not match the Expedia description. It consisted of a long hallway back from the door back to a cramped, undecorated (no pictures, no wallpaper), starkly lit room painted landlord-white and furnished only with the bed, curtains, a TV on a small stand, a desk, and a small bedside table. (No chairs, no reading lamps.) It felt (and echoed) like vacant commercial office space. I later learned that the staff referred to this as an airline-room because it was usually used by flight crews crashing for a few hours. We asked if anything else was available and were shown a couple of just OK, but way not four-star rooms. (Presumably the rating has to do with the large glass showers that overpower the bathroom space.) We took one and were nickeled-and-dimed a small nightly fee for the change. I soon learned that this was part-and-parcel of a culture of disrespect for the customer. For instance, when we ordered the old-fashioned-Quaker-oatmeal for breakfast we were surprised to find it had been made with apple juice rather than water (making it a kind of slushy). We politely registered out surprise to the waitress who treated us like we were insane for thinking oatmeal came any other way and refused to change our order.

The worst part is that they lost my bag at check in. My rook was not ready at 1:15PM and I returned at 4:30. My room was ready and the front desk told me my bags were in the room. They were not. I had to go to the concierge desk who tried the baggage storage. 10 minutes of waiting and no bags. It took an annoying 1/2 hour for the staff to locate and return my bags. The the problem was the mini bar. It was supposed to operate through a remote electronic connection. This was not working for the entire three days I was at the hotel and the bar was re-locked each day and would not open until I called the service desk and had an engineer visit the room with a screw driver to pry open the bar.

The location is great (just a block from the cable cars) and the quality of the rooms was good. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was modern and in good condition. The service from the staff was exemplary. Checkin time is 4pm in the afternoon but we arrived from the airport at 9:45 am and they offered us a room since they had one available. This was a refreshing and something unexpected in this day and age. The pool area is decent (although it's smaller than what's shown in the pictures) but we found that the pool is often filled with children in the afternoon and evenings and its tough to get laps done in the pool (due to the children playing in the pool) unless you go in the morning. As for downsides, the carpet was a little tired and the room was a bit small but I think this size room is common in a metropolitan downtown hotel. I disagree with the previous review about the water pressure in the shower. The showerhead is a rain-showerhead... it's supposed to be lower pressure to simulate what you would experience in the rain. This was a nice effect and the wife and I loved it. Overall, we loved the quality of the hotel, the location, and the great service from the staff and would definitely go back to this hotel in the future.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-07-11T07:18:52Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"23406","reviewId":"17985329","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Ian","brandType":"Expedia","title":"hotel","reviewText":"we stayed in the little princess room which was perfect for us.

Also, like most hotels now they put that \"complimentary water\" in the room with a way too high price if you so much as move it! But seriously - really really lovely people - from front desk to waiter and waitress at breakfast. Speaking of food - quite a breakfast buffet - and unlike previous reviewers I liked the food. The Asian Chicken soup - a good late night room service order was fantastic. The Hotel is in good location IF you walk away from the \"Tenderloin\" way - which we messed up and did first day. But the Chinatown way and towards the hills lovely. Concierge was really really helpful and gave us great directions to get around. Enthusiastic and friendly. I would stay there again for sure. Very nice.

The things I was disappointed with in the hotel had a lot to do with the price of items they charged for in the hotel. The number one complaint I had was why any hotel charges $10 or anything for that matter to use their swimming/exercise area. I've never paid good money to stay at a hotel and then had to pay if I wanted to sit in the hot tub or go swimming. The number two complaint, which is probably tied with my number one complaint was the water pressure in the shower, there was none. When the water doesn't even make it to you there's a problem. Don't even consider eating at this hotel as a cheeseburger and fries were $18!! Maybe if you're from one of the coast's then you might be used to paying this, but an extremely expensive meal to me for a Cheeseburger and fries is around $10 (roughly twice as much as I normally pay). As far as for a business side complaint they charge $13 a day for internet, another ammenity that you get for free at a Super 8 even. We also placed items in our refrigerator that were taken out. Later we did see that our refrigerator in our room essentially wasn't for personal use or they could charge us for what was put in there, unlike any normal hotel. This was the first \"4 Star\" hotel we've ever stayed in and if this is how they all are, I'll never stay in one again.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Kansas City, MO","reviewSubmissionTime":"2008-05-28T13:30:35Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"23406","reviewId":"17984910","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Louis","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Clean and quiet","reviewText":"The Nikko is pefectly located, within walking distance of shops and restaurants, yet the room felt like an oasis of tranquility away from city noise.

I wouldn't have minded except the equipment was in disrepair (especially the 2 ellipticals)and no one is around to help. Great concierges. Which was good because all the interesting things that drew me to the hotel were discontinued and I needed their help to find replacements. The hotel is no longer particularly Japanese. They don't have shiatsu massage rooms any more. The concierge will set up in-room massages for you, but it is very tight. We had a couple's masssage; one girl was very good, the other just ok. The restaurant is supposed to be japanese/european, featuring a japanese breakfast, etc. They have one $29 bento box that is so Americanized it is a joke. SImilar issues with the sun brunch. The milkshakes mentioned in many reviews are now off the menu. Housekeeping went insane and moved my stuff around so much that I spent 10 minutes looking for my pocket knife (went from nightstand to far under the bed). My $30 eyeliner that was in the bathroom was never located. No turndown.

From our Window you looked out to Macys, and Macys sits on Union Square the heart of downtown. The room had great views of the city, big windows.

Irish Bar Foleys is also just across the road, and that was great with live music, good food, and lots to drink. Starbucks is located in the Lobby. Only thing that was odd, no safes in the rooms, you had to use the reception safety deposit boxes. $10 to use the pool/gym. My advise would be to stay in this area, the Pier area of the city is over commercialized and full of American tourists Things to do in the city, hire a bike and ride across the Golden Gate Bridge, a great experience. Muir Woods, and Yosemite Park are lovely places.

Valet parking, internet service and the ANZU hotel resturant will leave your wallet at lot lighter. Also, the hotel hits your credit card to the tune of $200 for \"incidentals\" but doesn't tell you this at check in, so bear in mind you'll be out that money as well. The O'Farrell-Mason Parking Garage kitty corner from the hotel is cheaper by $10/day, and the walk is only a 1/2 block. Also a nice deli at the exit of the parking elevator with big sandwiches at cheap prices. Beds were very comfy, view from room was cool. Nice Starbucks downstairs. Great access to everything in the city, including shopping, Chinatown, cable cars and muni. Ate at hotel one night and it was not very good and very, very expensive. Found great diner up Mason street 1/2 block that was good and cheap. Got directions to Alcatraz Pier from concierge and she led us directly into the San Francisco Marathon and we almost missed our tour, so be wary of their advice. Lots of street people out front of hotel, so we started exiting out through the valet area which was a little better. All in all a great place but alot of extra costs involved.

We stayed in a deluxe King room on the 12th floor. It was an averaged sized hotel room with all the trimmings (fridge, hairdryer, iron/board, coffee machine) and a flat panel TV. The room was clean and probably better than average. The bathroom was clean but will need some touch ups soon to maintain a 4 star rating. Not a big deal, but things like the bottom of the bathroom door chipped, or the countertop scuffed up, etc. Although the weather was not hot during our stay (60s), we found the AC useful to help with the humidity. Beware travellers...the older hotels may not have AC, so if you must have it then ask the question before booking. It was at a great location and staff very friendly. Close enough to Union Square and shopping but just off to the side so there wasn't too much traffic. I felt safe walking back to the hotel at night. You could see a couple of homeless people asking for change but they were harmless. One thing though, if you are walking by yourself (or even in company) DON'T walk towards the tenderloin district on O'Farrell (I think that was the street). For about a 3-4 block stretch, it was definitely scankie and shady. I didn't feel safe. If you must walk in that direction, take a bigger street like Geary or hop on the bus (muni #38 takes you to and from Japantown on Geary for some great Japanese food at Japan Center). Overall, it was a great stay.

As we were registering, we were told that the pool and fitness center was an extra $10.00 a DAY and the internet would be at the rate of $9.95 a DAY. Yes, you can get wireless but only in the lobby and that is a separate service and another charge. Oh and NO there are no DVD players. Our room did not have a refrigerator it had a mini bar! We called and housekeeping brought this portable thing they called a refrigerator. The control button was broken the outside looked as though someone had taken a hammer to it and the inside was all cracked and broken. Well we get past all of that and since we are going to be there for 12 days we thought we would just make the best of it. As the days ticked by, we started noticing that the only thing the house cleaner service was doing, each day was making the bed, emptying the garbage and putting new towels in the bathroom. By the time we left the room had dust an inch thick (I wish I were kidding but I am not). Furthermore, they did not clean the tub or shower one time in 12 days even though we asked them to. I will end this on a good note however and say that the restaurant that is located in the hotel, \"ANZU's\" is wonderful; they know how to cook a steak. So there you have it.

It is located in the heart of Union Square which is PERFECT for public transportation. VERY easy to get to Fisherman's Wharf, North Beach, Chinatown, etc.Between the buses, trains and cable cars it was perfect. The hotel Nikko is sparkling clean in every area. The main lobby has beautiful with fountains, japanese lanterns and a grand piano. The Anzu bar area has wonderful and had a great variety of drinks. I loved the Saki-Tini! YUM. The Staff at the front desk are all very friendly and SO accomodating. (Hello Be!) We had the Deluxe King room which was spacious enough for 2 and the bathroom was huge! When we asked for a refrigerator for our room and it was brought up in 5 minutes. They upgraded our TV to a 37inch flatscreen on the last day, I was shocked!! You are totally treated like royalty at the Nikko. The pool is the cleanest, nicest I have ever seen with beautiful Japanese plants surrounding it. It was empty most of the time during our stay.

The hotel, although modern, is not new. There are hints of wear and tear. The room's bathroom tub being an absolute disaster with stained grout that was missing in places and a stained tub floor (safety footing marks looked filthy). This room's tub needs an overhaul. Also in need of an overhaul was the TV computer system. My remote keyboard would not function properly with certain keys broken. In addition the hotel charges for internet use on their TV computer system which I was unable to use. Also unable to check out electronically.

A word of warning - do not use the mini bar for your own personal use, as each item has a sensor on it and was charged to the room the second you removed it. After discovering this, I called down and they brought me my own personnal refridgerator to use. I put back all the items, but upon checkout was still charged. They quickly credited me the charge. My only complaint was that on the 18th floor, where we stayed, the rooms have older furnishings and the caulking around the tubs and showers are old and discolored.

The shared areas of the hotel were gorgeous, the staff was friendly and efficient. Although it is true that the bed is in a corner and there aren't bedside tables, there is a headboard that provided all the near-the-bed storage we needed.

The location is excellent (very close to shopping and dining) but as experienced on previous trips, the noise at night can be loud. Despite the high price, I have absolutely no complaints about the hotel. These top floors were recently renovated and have beautiful accomodations (incl a plasma TV) and all services were prompt and unobtrusive. This is one of the best hotels I've stayed in, even compared to some of the top hotels in Chicago and NY.

And the buffet breakfast at ANZU should be taken advantage of - the tastiest selection you could possibly want is all available. Location wise, it's literally a stone's throw from Union Square's shopping attractions and a short cable car ride to Fisherman's Wharf. It's hands down the BEST hotel in S.F. and I don't hesitate to give them 5 stars across the board. I can't wait to go back!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Brooklyn, New York","reviewSubmissionTime":"2004-12-11T01:20:56Z","roomTypeId":"","userDisplayName":"","reviewerCategories":[]},{"isRecommended":"YES","isFlaggable":false,"isUnverified":false,"totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"hotelId":"23406","reviewId":"17985523","photos":[],"itinId":"","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Cornelia","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Niko stay a winner","reviewText":"I went to San Francisco to spend time with my daughter and her growing family.

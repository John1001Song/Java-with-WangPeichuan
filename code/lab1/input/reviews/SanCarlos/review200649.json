We typically stay in 4-5 star hotels, with boutique hotels being our favorites. We were shocked to find anything three stars or above were well over $400/night. The gentleman who checked us in, muddled through the process, taking quite a long time to process a reservation that had been prepaid. Our room was out-dated and extremely dark. However, unless we wanted a smoking room, no other rooms were available. In all fairness the room was clean and had been freshly painted. However, when we retired for the night we noticed the sheets were stained, thread-bare and very scratchy. We would have switched hotels, but by this time there was little availability and the cost was ridiculous. We had booked for a two night stay. The room had not been serviced, perhaps as it was an extended-stay. I ended up purchasing a set of sheets for us to sleep on. The bed was also hard and uncomfortable. We could hear every sound from the hall way and as we were on the street level, we were unable to open our drapes for more light, as we were located near the front of the hotel and could see everyone entering the hotel.

Anything covered in fabric was sticky and filthy, carpet disgusting.   The bed was the worst.  There was a dirty imprint on top of the bedspread in the shape of a large body, and a permanent indentation in the mattress that matched.  It looked like someone had an \"extended stay\" in our room, come back every evening after work and flopped down in the same spot to watch TV . . . then stayed there for hours.  Had the rest of the room not been so filthy we would have asked for another room, but I don't think it would have made a difference.  I couldn't imagine that other rooms would have been that different.\r\n\r\nThe corridors and room smelled moldy and musty.  The staff wasn't exactly rude, they just didn't smile or speak.  No one asked us how are stay was when we checked out.  They either didn't care or were afraid of what the answer would be!\r\n\r\nThat we had to pay $195.00 for this room is unbelievable to me!

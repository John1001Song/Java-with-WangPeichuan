The desk people were great, although I did not like that we were asked to pay for a package deal that included Internet.

My biggest gripe with the stay is that I paid up for a premier room which supposedly had a bay view and what that meant is that if you stood at one edge of the window and looked diagonally you would catch a glimpse of the bay. Standing squarely in front of the window and looking out treated us to a view on the outside wall of the Fairmont Hotel across the street. I felt ripped off. The room also faced California street and even thought we were on the floor below the top, we had to hear the noise of the tracks at night.  The rooms are small and somewhat dated.  I'm guessing that there are better places in town at the $300 per night price point.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast was ok.

First off, the location is fantastic: very walkable to performing arts venues, city hall, museums and there public transit past the door.

The bathroom had all of the ambiance of a fast food restaurant bathroom.  The TV had some issues (the top two inches of the screen were damaged), but the cable selection was great.  The room came with a fridge and microwave, but the fridge constantly made noise which I was able to tune out, and kept freezing my beverages, but I was eventually able to fix it.\r\n\r\nThe staff were relatively friendly, and the cleaning staff did not speak much English, although they were nice enough.\r\n\r\nThe major drawback is that the walls are paper-thin.  There was a couple above me making loud noises until after 2:00 AM on my last night that kept me up, and I could hear people talking at even a conversational level in the other rooms.\r\n\r\nIf you're on a budget, and want walkability, and don't plan to spend a lot of time in your room, I would recommend it.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"The location!","negativeRemarks":"I'm not sure anything can be done about the noise transfer, given the age of the building, but the bathrooms could stand to be a little nicer.","locationRemarks":"Nice and central, close to the performing arts district and public transit.","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Toronto, Canada","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-02-25T18:39:47Z","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}],"userDisplayName":"","roomTypeId":464044,"isUnverified":false,"isFlaggable":false,"isRecommended":"YES"},{"hotelId":"19842","totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"30029","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"photos":[],"reviewId":"56cf3d25831e450981563ce2","itinId":"12873017982","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"HMP MMD","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Hip Granny","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Clean, quiet, great location for symphony, opera, ","reviewText":"Great walkable location for arts venues.

Very low water pressure for showers and flushing toilets. Poor bathroom lighting. There were 11 floors. We were on #10. But it sounded like we were sleeping on the street. So much noise from outside.

We got parking easily when we checked in on a Tues early afternoon, but by evening we heard others at desk saying there was no parking remaining. They were given back their parking fee, but left to own devices to find parking elsewhere. We never moved our vehicle throughout our stay because we worried we wouldn't get a spot when we returned.

Front desk staff was excellent and knowledgeable about the area, especially Sharon. the whole time we were there, and we would come back to the hotel at different times, we NEVER saw a manager.\r\n\r\nOur room was larger than I expected, very clean (and stayed that way the whole time we were there), and for a 'partial view' we had a very nice view of the Golden Gate and Lombard Street. We were on the 10th floor. The toilet/shower area is very small and no exhaust fan. The Vanity area (separate from from the shower area) was spacious enough, with storage under the vanity, but so dark I couldn't do my make-up there and my husband had to shave in the full length mirror.

It's about 3/4 of a mile from the Wharf so you could walk if you wanted. \r\n\r\nOur problems started on our 2nd morning there with the elevators. I was waiting for it with another couple (my husband had gone up a few minutes earlier) and was told one of the elevators was out. They got that one open and out came an old man with a ton of suitcases. Maintenance said we could go in the other one when it opened. We did. We pressed 8 and 10, it went to parking. Went back up about a floor and STOPPED. Now we were stuck. We were stuck for 15 minutes!

The hotel is older but well maintained and they embrace the theme so it doesn't seem like the hotel is as old as it is. The room was large and the bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was small but very functional. The lobby bar was always busy and seemed like a nice hangout for the area. Also the starlight room is on the 21st floor and the patrons take the same elevators as guests. I found this a little off putting as I was in the elevator with about 10 unsavory characters. I would definitely recommend the Drake as it is probably the most affordable in the area and really doesn't skimp on amenities. I love Kimpton Hotels and stay at one anytime I have a chance. As with all Kimptons there is a free wine social everyday from 5-6 and they are very pet friendly. This was a wonderful stay and experience in SanFran.

The bellman was very helpful as was the front desk staff who allowed us to check in early.  That was the extent of our pleasant experience.  That evening, my mother pulled back the linens on her bed to find DIRTY sheets.  We called the front desk.  They said they couldn't help; she would need to call housekeeping.  We did.  It was 11:00 PM.  Thirty minutes later we still didn't have clean linens.  She called again.  Apparently there was a shift change, and the message wasn't relayed.  Ten minutes later a man arrived with clean linens, but he was unable to change the sheets because that was \"not his job.\"  Truly, he said that.  The bartenders were rude and inefficient causing for long waits and small drinks.  The bathroom was very small.  There were no glasses or cups in our room. No coffee pot.  Far from a four star experience.

The staff was quite professional and accomidating.  I check in around 11:30 am which is about the same time most people check out.  So I was lucky to have the riom available, didn't necessarily need a high floor, took a rest, then eoamed around downtiwn.   They have a good seafood restaurant with a Japanese theme, had oysters instead of sushi (ate tons of sushi in SF earlier on).  Had to get up super early to catch the flight back home, so the airport shuttle drive in area was easy to manage while I checked out.  I recommend this hotel fir singles and couples alike, along with business travelers and tourists.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"South Plainfield, NJ","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-08-15T11:31:22Z","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}],"userDisplayName":"","roomTypeId":12592,"isUnverified":false,"isFlaggable":true,"isRecommended":"YES"},{"hotelId":"23406","totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"photos":[],"reviewId":"57afd083c25ece0b062a7daf","itinId":"1127812023833","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Beautiful hotel in San Francisco ","reviewText":"The hotel was beautiful.

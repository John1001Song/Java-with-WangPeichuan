Delayed by LA and SF traffic 2.5 hours for 9 PM check in. Take their call or your room may disappear. Upon arrival, learned site is not handicap accessible. Miserable for 3 of us that shared recent injured knees, and/or knee surgery. Room on 3rd floor was nice with overlook of bar next door. Only ice machine broken for some time. Nice fridge,microwave,coffee maker. Room comfy, but narrow. Parking is poor/more narrow, and if you do not get there early each night, you must fight for street parking. Staff not up on local tourist spots, advising cable car rides were $60 to $100/ each. Pamphlet supply next to them was great/helpful. They did know where post office was though. Breakfast was okay (yogurt/prepack cereal/pastry, apple/oranges, juice bottles, and you must pick up in lobby. Few restaurants in area so bring food if coming late.

There was a  TV, refrigerator & blow dryer. I don't recall an alarm/clock, but I used my phone for that anyway.\r\nNo closet but there is a hanging rack with hangars. The sink area was clean and fairly modern. The toilet / shower room was clean as well and even has a window up in the ceiling to let light in. \r\nThe motel is old, I believe 3 stories high (The lower story being parking) and is well maintained. The neighborhood was what could be expected for downtown San Francisco. A decent continental breakfast was served (and much appreciated!) That included packaged pastries, fresh fruit, small yogurt cups and refrigerated fruit juice.\r\nAlthough I was not cold, my only complaint is that there is no bed spread, just sheets and blanket. Also the weather stripping could use some refreshing. I was there for 1 night on business, slept well, ate nearby and was just a mile or so from Moscone Center so the cab ride was quick or I could have walked of I wanted.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"F","userLocation":"Las Vegas","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-01-23T18:03:25Z","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}],"userDisplayName":"","roomTypeId":56152,"isUnverified":false,"isFlaggable":false,"isRecommended":"YES"},{"hotelId":"14553","totalPositiveFeedbacks":2,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":2,"photos":[],"reviewId":"569e60679c8a4b0958f7ca20","itinId":"1122401747391","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Loved it!","reviewText":"Biz traveller that has stayed at more 'upscale(?)' hotels in the area and they don't provide the amenities this place does.

The A/C is very loud, but I didn't use it while sleeping so it didn't matter. The traffic noise was barely noticeable even though all the rooms are close to the street. Free continental breakfast (6:00 - 10:00 AM) was pre-packaged danishes, instant oatmeal, dry cereal, fruit, milk, apple juice, orange juice, tea, and coffee.

Unfortunately our stay was ruined by two poor policy decisions by the hotel management.  On check-in, I made it clear I was using a debit card and was assured that no deductions would be made during \"pre-authorization\". This was untrue as $100 was immediately deducted and after we spent more than the $100 on a meal, not only was another $100 deducted but also the cost of the meal as well.  We now had over $300 not available on our debit card. We are assured it will be returned - in 5 days.  So my advice - do not use a debit card in this hotel even when you're told it will be OK.  The second is the Free WiFi fine print. The hotel advertises that free wifi is available. They don't tell you that it is NOT available free to Expedia bookings!! Expedia clients get one hour free wifi - only in the lounge, only for one device per room and only once per stay - seriously.  Free wifi is only available to loyalty program members, corporate clients and people who book directly thru the hotel website.  None of this is made clear anywhere until arrival. Free WiFi should be available in all hotels and for this hotel to gouge its Expedia clients in this way is unforgivable.  If you get caught like we did, persist with your request for free wifi and the staff will eventually provide an access code! Also allow an hour to checkout! Apart from these very sour notes, it was a very pleasant stay.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"The ambience and decor is incredible","negativeRemarks":"Poor staff training leading to misleading info at checkin about debit card use.

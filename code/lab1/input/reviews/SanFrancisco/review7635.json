Clean comfortable and very welcoming. Front of house and restaurant staff had the usual American welcome that was very good. No attitude just great service. Usual US hotel free internet is a real positive for UK travellers. \r\nMy room was on 6th floor, very clean comfortable and well appointed. Good air conditioning Filter coffee maker in room with powder creamer - not good for English tea. Fridge in room too \r\nOnly negative was the road noise from freeway - Windows only single glazed so bring earplugs if like me you're a light sleeper \r\n\r\nBreakfast simple but plentiful fresh buffet style \r\nDefinitely recommend to overnight or even city tourists as the price was about half of city centre hotel at same standard.

One of my favs! Hotel is always nice and clean, the staff doesn't bother me every 2 seconds. No doorman in my business and no bugs in the room! Haven't ate the restaurant since my first time stating their, (food had no flavor). Since then the hotel has been renovated and also the menu has changed so who knows.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"california ","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-06-07T18:55:47Z","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}],"userDisplayName":"","roomTypeId":200995218,"isUnverified":false,"isFlaggable":true,"isRecommended":"YES"},{"hotelId":"7635","totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"photos":[],"reviewId":"5752ff55c023fa0b4f4d3c0a","itinId":"1136881456960","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[{"userNickname":"Jim","displayLocale":"en_us","isFlaggable":true,"date":"2016-06-06T18:50:02Z","response":"Thank you for your nice review, please come back soon!

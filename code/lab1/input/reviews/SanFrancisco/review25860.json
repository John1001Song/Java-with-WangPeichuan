Indian style restaurant inside had a great breakfast (pancakes) and there was a cool bar/pizza place next door to hotel which was also great. The room was small for my taste but provided everything I needed. I asked for a frig. and received it promptly. The only issue was the air conditioner/heater which we couldn't  turn on but fortunately we were not really of need of it due to the weather during our stay. Valet will cost you but I think it's worth it. The area is downtown and not particularly clean but it was a short walk to central park area where we commuted by bus to the tourist hot spots.

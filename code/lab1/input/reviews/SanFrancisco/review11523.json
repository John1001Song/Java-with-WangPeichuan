We had a nice little corner view of the bay bridge! It seems like the amenities in the room have been upgraded recently. The thing that could have been better is the water pressure in the shower but overall it was a great stay. The location is pretty good. Let's be honest SF has a huge homeless problem and in the financial district there are considerably less than union square and the sort. The hotel was withing walking distance of the piers and markets near the bay bridge and made for a nice walk down. There are coffee shops all around this hotel. If you are looking to go out at night the Uber rides will cost you around 20 dollars to get to the popular local bars, so not bad. One thing to note about parking is there is a parking garage on battery street withing a 30 second walk of the hotel. I think it was $34 dollars for 24 hours but I got it for $25 (no in and out privilege however) using an app called spot hero. The valet at the hotel charges $65 and parks in the same structure (they do allow in and out). We got the hotel on a deal for around $250 and considering how expensive all of the hotels in SF are I would consider this hotel a good deal and would stay here again.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"Water pressure in shower.","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Reno, NV","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-07-14T16:53:45Z","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}],"userDisplayName":"","roomTypeId":200482439,"isUnverified":false,"isFlaggable":true,"isRecommended":"YES"},{"hotelId":"11523","totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":0,"photos":[{"thumbnailUrl":"https://a.travel-assets.com/ugc/hotel-reviews/69D83C1CE98B9FFD36AD3ABCF83172773C51B5F51466442081637.jpg?resize=100:*","normalUrl":"https://a.travel-assets.com/ugc/hotel-reviews/69D83C1CE98B9FFD36AD3ABCF83172773C51B5F51466442081637.jpg?resize=360:*","caption":"View of bay bridge "}],"reviewId":"5768193df225300b4888c5bb","itinId":"1138080547835","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"HMP","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"leanne","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Nice location , trendy rooms , friendly staff ","reviewText":"This is our second stay at this hotel. We stayed in a superior king room on the 23rd floor . We were really happy with our over night stay. It's close enough to walk through the embarcadero center across the street . We had dinner at Tadich grill around the corner . Really nice area . Even though the weekends most things are shut down on weekends being in the financial district the hotel itself is worth the stay . We will be back again .

We sincerely apologize of the elevator being out of order during your stay. We understand it must have caused a great inconvenience. There was a technical issue we encountered. Our technician recommended that elevator stays closed until new part is received and installed. We ordered the part right away but it took a few days for us to receive the new part. That same day we installed the new part and elevator is now fixed and fully functional. Please accept our sincere apologies for your experience. We hope you'll give us another opportunity to restore your confidence in our hotel and our hospitality. Thanks you, Dianne.","status":"APPROVED","id":"f652330b-511e-4779-9d07-2becab990823"}],"ratingOverall":2,"langId":"2057","userNickname":"Dianne","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Fawlty Towers","reviewText":"70 yr old couple.

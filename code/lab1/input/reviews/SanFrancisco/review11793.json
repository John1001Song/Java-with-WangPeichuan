We picked it because of its proximity to the Caltrain - which wasn't remarkably close anyway, but the location was okay for SF visitors.\r\n\r\nMy room was underwhelming in general.  Fine, no outstanding amenities.  The building felt old, and not updated anytime recently.\r\n\r\nDay 1 - The mini-fridge had a solid rattle which kept me up at night, needed to unplug it.  My room overlooked the roof of a shorter building which had a noisy air conditioning unit which would wake me up when it restarted.\r\n\r\nDay 2 - Woke up to find out there had been a two hour blackout in the hotel, so my digital clock was wrong and could only be corrected by the staff.\r\n\r\nThen had an awful shower, which is tough to explain.  It had one knob, off when pointing straight up.  If you turned it to the right, you got cold water.  To the left, hot water.  But no way to get warm water.  It felt like some scenario interview question at Google that I wasn't smart enough to figure out.\r\n\r\nI found out that my co-workers had their own special issues with their rooms and various noises.\r\n\r\nI complained to the staff, which got my clock fixed, no change to my shower - I spent the rest of my days turning the knob back and forth during showers to avoid freezing and burning.  I'm not quite sure about the fridge, whether it was replaced or not, but it rattled less.\r\n\r\nThings were pretty uneventful for the next few days, until I was woken up on my last morning by a fire alarm.

We were happy with the size of our room since it was much larger than we expected, and we also liked the location of the hotel. \r\nUnfortunately we did not have ANY hot water in our room during our entire stay at the Pickwick. After chilly/windy days touring around the city, this was not an ideal situation to come back to. I let the front desk know, and she said she would let maintenance know. No one followed up with us, and it didn't get fixed. After our second round of ice cold showers the next day, we went back down to the front desk and spoke with a woman who told us that it was going to be looked into and that they had been having problems with their boiler. It wasn't until we asked for the manager to call us directly (since the front desk staff provided us with no help or answers), that we were given an apology. The manager did offer a small reimbursement, but that didn't fix our problem! Our water problem was ice cold our entire stay. Thankfully we were only there three nights.\r\nIn addition, after we had been storing items in our fridge, we learned that it hadn't been working.\r\nMy husband and I are very flexible and easy going people, but we would not stay at this hotel again. There were too many issues we dealt with during a short stay. We would have much rather spent more money to have stayed at a higher quality hotel where we would have been more comfortable.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Boston ","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-07-06T14:54:25Z","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}],"userDisplayName":"","roomTypeId":1224,"isUnverified":false,"isFlaggable":false,"isRecommended":"NO"},{"hotelId":"11793","totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"photos":[],"reviewId":"57741450f450ed332a059129","itinId":"1138561554125","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[{"userNickname":"Allen Allgood","displayLocale":"en_us","isFlaggable":true,"date":"2016-08-08T20:31:35Z","response":"Thank you for taking the time writing this great review about your experience with us and mentioning our staff!

Knowing this was an excellent hotel, I was excited about it. I toured SF and went to my room around 10:30 pm.  \r\nDue to the drink I had at the Tonga Lounge downstairs, which I think had too much sugar in it, I had trouble falling asleep.  What surprised me was that it was very, very noisy. I heard people coming down the hallway yelling to one another, I heard people having sex, and what sounded like revealers returning to their rooms late in the night, not caring about the noise they were making. I was surprised that the rooms were not a bit more soundproof, and it felt more like a Motel 6 experience.\r\nNeedless to say, I did not fall asleep until at least 1 am and woke up late and did not get to see as much of the city as I was hoping since I ended up falling to sleep so late. \r\nOther than that, the staff were very nice, the check-in and check-out process was very smooth.

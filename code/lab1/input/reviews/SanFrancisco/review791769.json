We have stayed at several Four Seasons properties in the past, and we appreciate the top-notch service provided by the staff. We were not disappointed by the SF property, at least when it comes to service. Check-in was a breeze, thanks to NaNa, who provided us with some suggestions for our stay. Service requests for extra pillows and room service were handled expertly. \r\n\r\nThe location could not be better. You have quick access to a bunch of great restaurants nearby, along with the Metreon (if you want to see a movie), the convention center, and several museums. The Embarcadero and the Ferry Building are minutes away via Muni. \r\n\r\nOur only quibble with the hotel was the quality of the rooms and the decor. The rooms and public spaces felt dated. I am not sure if they have been updated since the hotel opened back in 2001. There was really nothing special about the rooms. They were clean, and functional, but not really true to the Four Seasons brand. They did not feel particularly luxurious or stylish. Also, we could hear quite a bit of noise from the hallway as well as the floor above us.\r\n\r\nOverall, the location and service set this hotel apart from the others in San Francisco. However,  we were disappointed by the the ho-hum quality of the rooms.

Used to corporate chain hotels, it was nice to stay in a boutique hotel with a little more personality for a change. The room was small, but well appointed, which is what matters most to me. It was an easy, pleasant walk to my company's office in the Financial District, and I felt perfectly safe as a woman walking back and forth. It was nice to walk up Grant street on my way there and ogle the window displays of the high-end stores, and there are a number of restaurants around (though to be honest, I just ordered delivery to my room most nights, which was also a super easy process thanks to the text concierge services). My only small gripe is that the hotel is split above the 4th floor, and it can be a bit confusing to figure out how to get to rooms on and above the 5th floor the first time, so you might want to get a bellhop to show you up the first time if they tell you you'll need to take two elevators to get to your room!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"Lots of personality, free water bottle in the room, nicely appointed rooms, and great media/entertainment center.","negativeRemarks":"Better explanation of how to get to your room if you're on the \"other side\" above the 4th floor and/or a warning/option to NOT have that type of room.","locationRemarks":"Great location near Union Square if you're a tourist/into high-end shopping.

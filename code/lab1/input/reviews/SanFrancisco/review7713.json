The so-called breakfast was the most basic of prepackaged bread, and coffee, however we were not able to even partake of this as the office did not open until 8am (despite staff members being present), and we were told to go away and come back later, which was not possible as we had excursions arranged. The most appalling attitude prevailed from each member of staff, from our check in, right throughout our stay, as though guests were a downright nuisance to them, and they would all clearly rather be doing other things than dealing with the running of the hotel. \r\n\r\nWe loved San Francisco, but would rather pay considerably more to avoid this hotel in the future and we would not recommend it to others.

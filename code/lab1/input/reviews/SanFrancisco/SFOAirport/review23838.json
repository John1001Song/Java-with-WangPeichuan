From our initial experience of arrival and dropping off our car to the valet (a very friendly gentlemen welcomed us and took care of the car quickly), to a pleasant gentlemen at the desk who answered all of our questions & checked us in quickly (we did have reservations for our 3 day stay), to other hotel staff who were all smiles and acknowledged us as we arrived and got our luggage to the elevator.  Beautiful room, great views of the waterfront and arriving and departing flight at SFO.\r\nSurprisingly quiet, giving the proximity to the airport.  Clean, spacious, and well-appointed comfy room.   Our experiences at Hangar Steak for both dinner and breakfast were wonderful.  Expertly prepared steaks (tried the filet.  Best I've EVER eaten). My wife had the free-range chicken with root veggies.  She thought it was AMAZING.  Local produce was used, and it's SO fresh!!   The breakfast buffet was also beyond awesome.   Also, we appreciated having a dog relief station right out back for our service dog, complete with baggies.  All staff members ROCK!  Awesome folks, truly!  Marriot just GETS the concept of hospitality. We'll be staying here again very soon!","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"Everything.","negativeRemarks":"N/A","locationRemarks":"Quick access to 101 and all this beautiful city has to offer.

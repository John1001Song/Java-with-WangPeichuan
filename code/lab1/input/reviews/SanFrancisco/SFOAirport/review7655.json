Good place for families with small children to safe money on food.  Lots of working folks staying there too.  With a supermarket across the street and gas grills outside and a kitchen inside, meals were no problem.  We ate most of our lunches and dinners out but having the option of making our own meals was great.  They do what they call light housekeeping if you are staying less than a week - means you get clean towels and a made up bed every day but sheets are not changed.  Pretty much what you'd do at home so it didn't bother us at all.  You also have the option of asking them to change sheets more frequently if you want.

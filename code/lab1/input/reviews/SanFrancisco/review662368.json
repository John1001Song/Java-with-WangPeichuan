Maybe I caught it at a bad time, but the streets were filthy with trash everywhere and the streets so crowded that we walked down towards Fishermens Wharf and just turned back due to the congestion.  Anyway....this hotel in the financial district was our veritable shelter in the storm.  It was quiet, clean and whoever manages the staff must have been trained by a 5 star hotel.  It reminded me of the Ritz Carlton in Maui. Everywhere you go there is a smile and a \"do you need anything\"? They brought milk and cookies to the room every night for my girls. When I asked about the wifi fee, they comped it. When I struggled with the coffee maker, a new one was sent up immediately.  You are going to pay exorbitant amounts while staying in hotels in the San Fran/Napa/Sonoma area, at least here I got my $ worth.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"SERVICE!!!","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"In Financial District that I liked because it was quiet.","lastInitial":"f","userLocation":"austin","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-07-26T14:26:47Z","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}],"userDisplayName":"","roomTypeId":200110709,"isUnverified":false,"isFlaggable":false,"isRecommended":"YES"}]}}}

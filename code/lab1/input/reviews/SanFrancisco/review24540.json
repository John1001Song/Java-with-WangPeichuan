Attentive; they made you feel valued as a guest.\r\nPrimo location. 1 block away from union square, 3 blocks from the BART station. For a tourist, this is a great central point for such a walkable city as San Fran. You're a few minutes from a lot of cool stuff, or at least access points. Hotel is right in the middle of the shopper's row, 5-10 minute walk from Chinatown; I could go on about the location.\r\nAmenities were pretty nice. If you're looking for an uber-spacious place, then move on to the Ritz-Carlton. The rooms are cozy and comfortable. The hallways/elevators had a rustic feel to them, which, in my mind, let me know this building has some history behind it. All-wood floors, so if you don't like creaky floors then be advised. All-in-all, the rooms were clean, cozy, and great for an on-the-go tourist. When you needed to come in from your long day of walking & spending money, your room awaits for some TV watching, and winding down. The only \"con\" I could bring up about this place is that 1/2 elevators was out of service for the last 2 days of the trip, so taking it to the 7th floor took a bit longer than you'd want to hope; even then, it wasn't a big deal for me...take the stairs and problem solved!\r\n\r\nTake-aways: Very cool room layouts; workout room small, but effective use of space (chic); clean; comfy beds; in-room fridge; nice sized TV; accessible to everything; super friendly staff","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"Cozy beds, hotel staff, location, cleanliness, cool hotel decor (boutique/modern/rustic blend)","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"BART terminal a few blocks away, trendy shopping right outside your door, restaurants all over, Chinatown 5-10 minutes away, Cable Car","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Indianapolis","reviewSubmissionTime":"2016-07-06T15:41:25Z","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}],"userDisplayName":"","roomTypeId":200648000,"isUnverified":false,"isFlaggable":true,"isRecommended":"YES"},{"hotelId":"24540","totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"photos":[],"reviewId":"577c1cbb9bbe8d0b834e53bd","itinId":"1135831463005","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Work day stay","reviewText":"I was only at Hotel G for 1night, however I found the Hotel staff to be very friendly and helpful.

Easy access to SF and dinning
This was our third use of this facility and again we enjoyed our stay.  The facility is comfortable and kept well.  We  are retired and the price and  'ease of use' are important for us.  Not only does the hotel meet our needs, there's attractive shopping and dinning within a few blocks.  The proximity to the Bay Bridge is appealing.  There are a number of historic and entertaining site near this location, i.e., Jack London Square (Oakland); Pier 39 (SF); and Rosie the Rivitor NP (Richmond).

Needed a reasonable place just outside of SF to rest.  We ended up getting in too late to use the pool, but the room was comfortable.

Hotel Staff should be lower level vs other hotels
I asked hotel staff to bring nail cutter & opener, however they said that nail cutter is not available and I am required to go to bar to ask open.   I bought bottle of beer at front desk and it needs to be open by opener only.  Hotel should prepare the opener for their customer.   I have had good impression regarding Hilton Garden Inn based upon my experiences at other places, however I have been disappointed with this location at San Francisco.

Distant from a main areas
Only one restuarant nearby. Closes beach you could get to from here is 9miles and very small at that. To get here on city transport is hectic unless u out have a car or constantly Uber/lyft ($$). No big pool only a small hot tub. Pricey bar and in dinning in hotel.

Terrible
Staff was neither polite nor accomodating.  Would not grant a late check-out unless i was able to locate a loyalty acct number.  I definitely have one because i am incessantly barraged with their hhonors spam, but of course cant find the number.  I was also advised & assured that I had a zero balance upon check-in and check-out, but then they proceeded to charge me for the room four days after leaving, and added a 25 dollar "deposit" charge for each room.  Not sure what the hell a "deposit" charge is for... but i'm it's just a way to deceptively raise the rate for the room.

The location was the only thing pisitive... find another place to stay

This hotel would be wonderful except that it was too noisy.  They were kind enough to provide complimentary earplugs, otherwise I never would have been able to sleep.  If noise doesn't bother you, this hotel is nice for the price and in a good location to explore the wharf area of San Francisco.

Not as expected
Our room was on the first floor and was beside of an alley. The homeless people would come and stay outside of our room at night. You could hear them talking, coughing all night. There were people taking tours on segways past our window. The trucks emptied the dumpsters very early each morning. It was very noisy. This is the first time I have never been asked about my stay as I checked out. Would not recommend this hotel. Expedias website stated $45 parking fee  per night but when we arrived, we were charged $50 per night. When I questioned this, I was told "parking is $50. you will need to contact Expedia." Not a friendly staff at all.

Nice hotel, close to Fisherman's Wharf
Holiday Inn occupies one block.  We were fortunate to be located just in front of Fisherman's Wharf on Beach Street at 4th Floor. It was a bit noisy at night but there were ear plugs provided in the room. Very clean and Denny's Restaurant is at the ground floor. Parking is very limited but did not bother us since we did not have a rented car. Wallgreen's was just diagonally across the street so very easy to get water and some grocery items. E and F tram line station in front of Wallgreen's. Excellent location!

Great Choice Near SFO
The owners and staff of this property clearly take great pride in their work and facility.  The room was spotless, as was the rest of the building.  The check in and check out staff were extremely friendly and comfortable to talk to.  It is not the low price leader by any means, and they don't have dining options on premises, but I'd highly recommend it.  Especially if you have an early flight out in the morning.  The airport shuttle starts at 4 a.m. and pretty much runs every 30 min. after that.

Get the bay view on an upper floor..Hotel can be a bit noisy for light sleeper kids running but the room is comfy and spacious. The breakfast was better than expected eggs and bacon microwaved but behind the scenes most hotels rehear, hello homemade waffles and fruit all you can eat- the breakfast carried me through many early morning mid afternoon adventures in San Fran.

Very good hotel.  Many positives, few improvements
Spent three nights at the hotel and overall our stay at Bay Landing Hotel was pleasing.   Many positives such as free parking, clean rooms, quiet--albeit it was near the airport, our room #327 had a wonderful view of the bay and we could watch the jets take off and land, excellent paved walking/jogging path that goes up and down the bay.  

Free breakfast, but some breakfast items one needed to heated or reheated with the microwave as they were preprocessed frozen items ie bacon, sausage patty, omelets, ham, & a hash-brown potato wedge.   They did have three waffle irons for fresh made waffles.  Plenty of sliced and diced fruit and hot oatmeal.  Four different juice options and hot coffee. Their breakfast is nowhere as good as one's done by Embassy Suites, but it wasn't horrible either.   I just stayed away from the items one needed to zap in the microwave.    The breakfast dinning area is also small and congested.  Overall their breakfast was OK, but that is a good thing as I didn't overeat.    

Our room was extremely clean and spacious.  Beds were a bit small but comfortable.  They could have placed another bed or sofa couch in there to occupy the open "dead" space as the room had too much un-utilized space.  I recommend that they replace the their double sized beds with queens or king sized ones.  To be fair, they may have had rooms with double queens, but this room was the only one available for us when we booked.  

Bottom line---We would stay here again.

Check in was a bit strange. Gave me the key card to the room, then after I wandered away from the front desk, they asked me to return to reception, then after some deliberation gave me the same room. 

The rooms are fine, and tea and coffee is on offer all day in the lobby, but staying in the room directly across from the elevator is almost guaranteed to rob a light sleeper of sleep. 

Perhaps better to pay a bit more and book a bay view room. Or book a different hotel.

The hotel was small but conveniently located near the airport (10-minute drive). The guy on the hotel front desk was extremely helpful concerning restaurants within walking distance and he stressed that the area was safe. The room was nice. My only regret was that there seemed to be no elevator to help me move my suitcase to the second floor. But this was not much of a problem so I overlooked it. The wake-up call and the taxi I wanted arrived on time, which was perfect as I had a 6:45 a.m. flight.

Great and not just for the price
We took our 2 yr old son to SF for his BDay and the hotels in the city were crazy expensive. We went to a Giants game the first day, then stayed at this hotel, then took him to the zoo the next day. The location of this hotel was perfect. We went to dinner in Burlingame which is pretty close and it was great.
Check-in was fast and easy and the room was the cleanest hotel room I have seen in a long time. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.
My only complaint was with breakfast. I wasn't even going to have any of the complimentary breakfast because it seemed like it was just sugary cereal, but went to check it out anyway. I got some cereal for my son and realized after giving him two bites that the milk was spoiled. It was gross. Coffee was not good, especially since they only had sweetened creamer, plus the coffee itself tasted old as well. Next time I won't even try with the breakfast but everything else was great.

Do not believe trip advisor review on this hotel!!
Worst stay of my life!
Room smells old and damp.
Towels are worn out very bad and dirty.
Also feels creepy like never been washed and only dried over and over again.
Some towels got very darker color.
Asked for new towels and refused because they said they are washing towels.
I found bed bug right after I got a bite on right wrist early evening.
My wife got very stressed out and we couldn't use pillow or bed cover scared of bed bug.
Feels very betrayed because I chose this hotel on trip advisors good reviews.
I strongly believe they are fabricated somehow.
I am not gonna trust trip advisors review anymore.

Coffee in the room was not good but the one in the lobby is. Comes with a mini breakfast - some cereal, instant oats and fruits.  Overall I recommend this.

5 mins drive from AIRPORT, 15 mins walk to HERTZ 
It is not the sexiest place on earth but if you're looking for really low cost motel size place majorly close to the airport then this is your ticket. It's situated in a slightly run down area but it's utterly safe (we were there for 4 days) constantly in and out and around late at night also with 2 small children.

It's within 10 mins walk of a great little downtown. You can get diners, vietnamese, chinese etc. and they're really decent quality.

It's run by an Indian family who are so sweet and helpful.  Their breakfast is not great but we went out for a hearty breakfast everyday anyway so it didn't matter.  It's not the savoy by any stretch of the imagination but it's safe, clean and has has fast-speed wifi.

Would definitely use them again!!

The only downside I can think of is the breakfast, which is just cereal, a banana and a danish with bad coffee. But that's not enough for me to take off points.

Comfi Victorian near the Mission district
Great home base for a City that we love!  Walking distance to highly rated restaurants along Valencia, colorful scenes in the Mission and Castro, and tranquility in Noe Valley. Also easy to get BART, busses, taxis, or other transportation to all parts of the City. Staff at the Inn are extra helpful (i.e. Printing theater tickets for us, doing dishes after we warmed up leftovers from Mourad, etc.). Each room is different, but they leave the doors open of the vacant ones so you can scope out which one you might want next time.

Surprisingly nice hotel for price and location.
The staff is friendly and very helpful. They let me check in as early as 8:45am on my way from the airport to a conference! I stayed in room 12 on the first floor. Spacious for an SF hotel. Everything was good quality, and the breakfast spread was awesome every morning. If you are loud and like privacy, you might not love it, though, because you can kind of hear stuff in other spaces (just like in a normal old house). The gardens are beautiful and spacious with lots of separate lounging areas. There's a nice hot tub in a covered gazebo outside. There's a spiral staircase on the third floor that goes to a rooftop access with tables, chairs, and 360 view of city. They only charge $2 for sodas and bottled water (honor system!), and offer coffee/tea all day and free sherry and port for customers in the lobby. All of the antiques are all beautiful, and they really keep their plants up. I also had a room with my own full bath (soaker tub, shower, sink, toilet), which is NOT a given when staying in San Francisco's Mission District.

Victorian gem hidden in plain sight in the Mission
Spent three nights at the Inn while visiting my daughter who lives in the Mission District of the City.  Great location, friendly helpful staff, very Victorian harking back to early 1900s San Francisco, generous buffet breakfast.  I definitely would recommend the Inn to others.

Home away from home
What an excellent stay. It's an adult style B&B that is calm, peaceful, mature & relaxing. If you like classical music, a glass of port and reading a good article in the New Yorker yet completely unpretenious you will LOVE this place. I actually miss it and will go back.

Great Inn with a homey feeling
I absolutely loved being in the Inn. First of all I was greeted very warmly by the staff and even though I arrived a bit early they let me check in to the room early and gave me a tour of the place. There are so many small touches that make it feel like a home away from home - coffee all day, cookies, fruit, newspapers, books, magazines, a scrumptious breakfast better than any I'd had traveling all around Europe.
My room was the smaller one in the Inn but it was still cozy, clean and comfortable. I usually don't go into lobbies of hotels but this lobby area, which is really like the family room, was so inviting I found myself going there whenever I had a few minutes spare time.
The Inn was also located in a perfect place for me since my daughter lives in the Mission area. They gave me a map of all the restaurants in the area that are recommended and it was terrific seeing so many choices. The first one I went to was just a few minutes walk away and the food was excellent, just like the recommendation. Absolutely everyone at the Inn made me feel at home and they even invited my daughter to join me in breakfast, something I found above and beyond what any other place would have done. I am definitely going to be coming back!

Beautifully fantastic with old world charm
I had only stayed at a few bed and breakfasts in my life and this is the best one hands down! The quiet room the friendly, helpful staff were a Godsend and the plethera of breakfast selections served until 11 AM were unsurpassed!! We didn't feel rushed to make it to breakfast we could lounge in bed until we were ready to get up. I also really loved the fresh flowers and fruit in the room. If I had a complaint which I am pressed to do so it is that the H2O in the shower fluctuated hot and cold willy nilly.
Anyone who says this B&B is haunted is a lunatic! We experienced NONE of the paranormal activity claimed in this establishment.

SF Oasis in the Mission
The hospitality of the staff & owner was excellent. We stayed in the annex adjacent to the main house & were upgraded to a larger room We would have been satisfied with a smaller room since we chose the B & B for its proximity to Bernal Heights & uniqueness of a B & B stay in SF versus our usual Hotel visits. We liked the variety offered at breakfast time & the option to enjoy breakfast in our rooms. Great roof top views & convenient public transportation options nearby.

The rooms are very noisy and hard to sleep at night, as if the walls are made of paper. You can hear everything that goes on in other rooms, that's 
One big problem and second although looks like it's newly renovated, there is no closet to hang cloths, it is just one small bar with hangers that you can use. But I must say cleanliness is one big plus for this motel!

They had no telephone, no coffee, no place to hand your clothes in the bath room and in the room, no table,  two chairs to sit on, the door had a gap on the bottom that was over one inch high, so letting the wind in the room, and a small gag on the weather strip also,  The heater and air conditioner was very noisy when it came on. A very noisy location near the freeway, I will not recommend nor will I go back there again.

Closest Hotel to Golden Gate Area with  Best Value
The hotel looks older on the outside, but my room, a good - sized room with double beds (room 224)  inside has been newly renovated and tastefully updated - nice floor, colour scheme, comfortable beds and pillows, updated bed covers. There's personal fridge, widescreen hdtv, electric iron, microwave, complete set of toiletries ( mini shampoo/conditioners, bath soap, shower cap included), and complete set of fresh and clean towels. The room and bathroom were clean and presentable.  I only have three minor gripes:  1. I could hear the tv in the next room. Although not at a disturbing intensity, it can be an issue to others. The sound from my tv kind of covered over the next room's tv sound. 2. The bath tub was slow in draining, so it was partially clogged down the line somewhere. Management should make sure their cleaners need to test drainage each time. I had to stand on the top of the tub walls on the later part of my shower because I didn't want my feet to get soaked on the gray water. 3. Lacks a small table.

Overall, I had a positive experience, and had a good night's sleep, on comfortable bed and pillows, and clean sheets. Most of all, for the price I got of about $110 per night, it's the place that gave me the best value for what I was looking for - just a few minutes to the Golden Gate.

The hotel was great.  I didn't know it was a Wyndham vacation property so was a little surprised about the request to attend the 2 hour presentation to obtain a $125 gift card.  Would have been curious to learn more; however, not take 2 hours out of a 48 hr. weekend in the city to get the information. Room was lovely.  Staff excellent. Also didn't realize with Expedia you pay 100% upfront for the room, but that worked out OK too.

This hotel had an excellent location for exploring many SF highlights like North Beach and the Ferry Building.  But I had a problem with how I was billed:  Expedia charged my credit card for the full amount at time of billing, which, in my case, meant I was paying for my entire hotel stay a month before even seeing my room.   I prefer to be billed at the time of check-in or departure.

Nice location, old hotel
We stayed in a room on the 9th floor with 1 king bed and a sofa. Although the hotel was not renewed recently, the room was spacious enough for a family (2 adults, 2 children). However, the sofa bed was not comfortable enough as the king bed. There was a microwave oven and a coffee machine in the room. The fridge was empty but was ready for your own food. Hotel staff was very friendly and the lady at the front office gave us very informative clues about the city. They also have prepared a short information document to underline popular visiting sites and local eats.
But the best thing of all was the location of the hotel. It was just adjacent to the Union square, where all shopping and activities are present. As a last word, it was a good experience to stay at the Donatello hotel.

We found the room to be, for four of us (two adults, two teens) to be spacious and comfortable.  There was enough room to spread out, and the fact that we had a microwave, fridge and all basic kitchen supplies (even including a bottle opener) was super.  Included in our rate we had access to the Club Level, which afforded us use of the gym, sauna, spa, coffee/tea area and the beautiful deck on that level.  We were made to feel welcome and felt that the location was great - a LOT of restaurants and shopping in the area.

Got a great deal at the Donatello Hotel - definitely worth the money and the Club room was great because it had free coffee and hot chocolate and tea - perfect for warming up after being out in the crisp cold weather of SF.
Perfect location, and the room was neat and large enough for our family of 4.
The timeshare presentation saleslady was a little annoying, but they weren't overly pushy when we ultimately decided that we didn't want to waste 2 hours listening to the presentation, even though we could have gotten a 2 night stay and $50 gift card.

After my first night no ones shows to clean our room... we come back to the hotel at 11:30pm and fund the dirty towels on the floor...nothing was done.. I had to shower and re use the dirty towels that I had lifted in the bathroom floor. I went to take to the hotel manager and she just said I am sorry... ridiculous... 4 start hotel w no customer service. I will never stay in this property anymore.. the didn't offer me nothing.. I had breakfast there one time and the breakfast buffer is sooo poor and expensive... not worse it.. its better to got across the street and get a coffee etc.ANOTHER ABSURD IS THE 70 DOLARS VALET PARKING DAILY FEE

Great Central Location in Financial District
Had a great time! There were a couple days the hotel was being picketed by a local union early in the morning, but overall we really enjoyed our location. We stayed on the 8th floor- would recommend that location or higher if you're sensitive to traffic.

Nice hotel in a decent area.
We stayed in a regular king room, the room was spacious and the bedding was comfortable. We had a nice little corner view of the bay bridge! It seems like the amenities in the room have been upgraded recently. The thing that could have been better is the water pressure in the shower but overall it was a great stay. The location is pretty good. Let's be honest SF has a huge homeless problem and in the financial district there are considerably less than union square and the sort. The hotel was withing walking distance of the piers and markets near the bay bridge and made for a nice walk down. There are coffee shops all around this hotel. If you are looking to go out at night the Uber rides will cost you around 20 dollars to get to the popular local bars, so not bad. One thing to note about parking is there is a parking garage on battery street withing a 30 second walk of the hotel. I think it was $34 dollars for 24 hours but I got it for $25 (no in and out privilege however) using an app called spot hero. The valet at the hotel charges $65 and parks in the same structure (they do allow in and out). We got the hotel on a deal for around $250 and considering how expensive all of the hotels in SF are I would consider this hotel a good deal and would stay here again.

Nice location , trendy rooms , friendly staff 
This is our second stay at this hotel. We stayed in a superior king room on the 23rd floor . We were really happy with our over night stay. It's close enough to walk through the embarcadero center across the street . We had dinner at Tadich grill around the corner . Really nice area . Even though the weekends most things are shut down on weekends being in the financial district the hotel itself is worth the stay . We will be back again .

Not great
I will start out with the good things first - location. I enjoyed the location next to Union Square and close to Market Street. Tons of shops and hole in the wall restaurants San Fran is known for. The room itself seemed clean. However, they put us in a handicap room right next to the construction. I understand hotels need updating and I didn't have a problem with the notes they left in ever room describing the construction will be done between 8am-5pm. But they didn't start at 8am they started much earlier. We called the front desk to complain about the workers being so loud earlier than described but they did nothing. They didn't even apologize. None of the staff asked us how things were going and I don't think I ever saw any of them smile once. It was not a pleasant experience. The staff was terrible and not friendly or helpful. Do not go here!

Tell your guest of renovations occurring online 
The location is great. When we arrived the entire hotel was under renovation. The gym and computer rooms were closed for renovation. This is fine, but when we booked not once were we notified of the condition of the hotel. This was a very disappointing experience. It taught me a lesson and questions to always ask prior to booking a hotel e.g. Is your hotel under any type of remodel? Are the amenities mentioned on your website all available? The valet person working all week would get into arguments with the front desk people every single time I saw him. This made me uncomfortable with him handling a rental car I was responsible for. The front desk staff were all great. There is even a amazing Mexican place and Starbucks directly connected to this hotel. I think once all their construction is complete it could be kinda cool, but unfortunately we had a terrible experience due to the construction. The bathroom in our room was tiny. There was literally no counter and we had to leave or stuff in the sink. Last, do something about the valet driver. He even double parked my rental in the bus/taxi lane right in the CENTER of the lane. What a bad experience.

I blame Expedia for not letting us know this hotel was undergoing renovations when I made the reservation. We would not have stayed here had we known. I realize any central SF hotel is going to be expensive, but considering the mess and noise, not worth what we paid.

Horrible mattress
There was construction going on, on our floor the whole week we were there.  Very loud and dusty.  The  mattress was the worst one I have ever slept on, you could visibly see it sagging in the middle.  There isn't a fan in the bathroom so it got quite muggy in our room after showering, the bathroom was so tiny there isn't room to move, really crappy finishings.  no where to smoke but out front with the pan handlers.

Find Something Better
We pulled up curbside and there were two workers inside doing nothing, but they didn't even bother to open the door, but I'd already paid; too late to cancel. It took a good seven minutes to finally get a key to my room that didn't work. I had to return to the desk three times before the front desk gave me a key to another room. Although recently remodeled, the shower handle was stuck. It took a great deal of messing with and strength to operate. We got a room overlooking the street. There was talking, steam release making noise from a manhole, and street walkers all night. Parking was difficult to find. Construction workers were buzzing in the morning, using the elevators and making more noise.

Would not recommend this hotel.
This was the worst experience ever!  EVER! It was so noisy and dirty and under construction -the entire 1 night stay was awful and I will never go back.  I could hear the street like it was in my room and the homeless were right next to me the entire night screaming and yelling all night.  I felt scared in the halls and workout room with a non functioning water outlet.  Please do not stay here.

Pretty in a picture 
While the hotel inside was "ok" and I say ok due to all the construction still going on while they are open.  The rooms were clean yet small but that is what  you would expect being in a downtown hotel.  Although it does claim to have high-end shopping in  The immediate area, walking directly out of the hotel that is not what you see.   The area is not a  desirable one.   Staff was nice enough they try to make the stay  as comfortable as possible   So that always helps!

Good location, but not up to par
Hotel Diva is located steps from Union Square, but there are many other hotels in the area that provide a better experience. The hotel was under renovation during my stay, but that was not an issue for me. There is no parking garage, so I had to make use of the valet, which required 30 minute notice to have it returned. The room was standard, but there was no electrical outlet available near the bed to plug my cell phone in at night. The bathroom was way too small...I was alone, but I don't see how it would be possible to share with my wife.

Bumpy start but hotel made good
Had a bumpy start as we arrived to be told they had over sold rooms and we were sent to a "sister" hotel with a VERY tiny room and no actual window.
The next morning we did return to the Diva and we were happily told that we would be upgraded to a king room and refunded for a night of our vacation.

Great location - if you love shopping. 
The hotel was great - free Cosmo shots every day between 5-7 and nice rooms. The location was so close to all major shopping centres (Macy's, Saks, Bloomingdales etc.) but required transit for anything else. The elevators were pretty slow and one eventually broke, but other than that, it was a great stay!

Disappointing Stay - Old Building, Horrible Shower
I stayed at the Pickwick for four nights on a work trip.  We picked it because of its proximity to the Caltrain - which wasn't remarkably close anyway, but the location was okay for SF visitors.

My room was underwhelming in general.  Fine, no outstanding amenities.  The building felt old, and not updated anytime recently.

Day 1 - The mini-fridge had a solid rattle which kept me up at night, needed to unplug it.  My room overlooked the roof of a shorter building which had a noisy air conditioning unit which would wake me up when it restarted.

Day 2 - Woke up to find out there had been a two hour blackout in the hotel, so my digital clock was wrong and could only be corrected by the staff.

Then had an awful shower, which is tough to explain.  It had one knob, off when pointing straight up.  If you turned it to the right, you got cold water.  To the left, hot water.  But no way to get warm water.  It felt like some scenario interview question at Google that I wasn't smart enough to figure out.

I found out that my co-workers had their own special issues with their rooms and various noises.

I complained to the staff, which got my clock fixed, no change to my shower - I spent the rest of my days turning the knob back and forth during showers to avoid freezing and burning.  I'm not quite sure about the fridge, whether it was replaced or not, but it rattled less.

Things were pretty uneventful for the next few days, until I was woken up on my last morning by a fire alarm.  Yay!

Cold showers and poor customer service
My husband and I recently stayed at this hotel for three nights for the last leg of our California vacation. We were happy with the size of our room since it was much larger than we expected, and we also liked the location of the hotel. 
Unfortunately we did not have ANY hot water in our room during our entire stay at the Pickwick. After chilly/windy days touring around the city, this was not an ideal situation to come back to. I let the front desk know, and she said she would let maintenance know. No one followed up with us, and it didn't get fixed. After our second round of ice cold showers the next day, we went back down to the front desk and spoke with a woman who told us that it was going to be looked into and that they had been having problems with their boiler. It wasn't until we asked for the manager to call us directly (since the front desk staff provided us with no help or answers), that we were given an apology. The manager did offer a small reimbursement, but that didn't fix our problem! Our water problem was ice cold our entire stay. Thankfully we were only there three nights.
In addition, after we had been storing items in our fridge, we learned that it hadn't been working.
My husband and I are very flexible and easy going people, but we would not stay at this hotel again. There were too many issues we dealt with during a short stay. We would have much rather spent more money to have stayed at a higher quality hotel where we would have been more comfortable.

Booked this hotel at last minute due to a previous booking at another hotel being below standard. Staff were helpful & curteous. Room was clean, tidy. Only criticisms were the room was very noisy due to traffic and location of hotel, hence has to be accepted when booking. The only other criticism was the lack of hot water this was only ever warm never hot and the water had to be run for a long time to achieve any reasonable temperature.

Nice hotel close to Moscone Convention Center.
The staff was friendly, the room was clean, the bathroom was a decent size. They provide Bath & Body works shampoo, conditioner, soap and lotion, which I happen to like. The hairdryer was good and powerful, not like most hotel hairdryers. To me, that's important. I was here for a conference, so the close proximity to Moscone was excellent. Plenty to eat and do around the hotel and the Muni F stop is 2 (short) blocks away, as well as the buses, to take you to all the sites in San Francisco. I had dinner my last night in the hotel's Soma Restaurant. I had read that the gnocchi was excellent and they were not wrong. very rich, creamy and cheesy, again, which I happen to like.

Well-located hotel with all the basics and charm
This hotel couldn't be better located.  It's nestled in a corner surrounded by the Westfield center mall, so you'll lack for nothing while you stay here.  It's a good-size lobby with the basics, which is perfect for getting out to your destination quickly.  The rooms are well furnished and the furniture updated in mine, which I appreciated.  It had nice old style windows to open and enjoy the SF 1st summer air, with newer windows fitted on top which I could keep closed to insulate the noise and heat if necessary.

The bed was tremendously comfortable, as were the sheets.  The bathroom was nicely done in old stone (marble?) in a very upscale older pattern.

A few areas like the doors and some trim were visibly older, but everything was well-maintained, and anything that needed updating had been, like the key card entry system and the desk lamps with charging plugs.  There was also in-room AC (that isn't a window unit - those don't count) which, while old, was perfectly serviceable.

Nothing that showed it's age was an inconvenience in any way, and the room still felt nice and clean and modern.

The bathroom was certainly smaller, and was lacking in any sort of counter space, but there was plenty of desk space and mirrors so that made up for it.  I will say it lacked a full-size floor mirror.

Loved the staff, everyone was very friendly and prompt, and I'd happily stay here for the price and location alone.

thin walls, small room
Stayed for a week. It was a slightly more interesting 2-3 star experience. The hotel was ok, the staff was good. I could hear the person in the next room using the toilet, I could easily hear the tv in the room on the other side until late into the night. A homeless person jumped in the elevator, saw I had pressed 5 and said "oh good, my floor", got off with me and asked about the ice machine, then vanished down the stairs when I did not walk to my room, but looked at my phone. I saw a pair of shoes and socks left on the central stairway coming down from the second to the first floor. The elevators stopped intermittently on floors where no buttons were pressed almost every ride. I did not feel in danger or that it was unclean.

Great location
I was in San Francisco for a five-day business seminar, and chose the Pickwick for it's reasonable price and proximity to my class location. The staff was friendly, helpful and efficient. There are several courtyards and a Yerba Buena Gardens within a couple of blocks. Westfield Center basically wraps around the hotel, so there is plenty of shopping and a massive food court. There are also nice restaurants just off of the lobby and in the top floor of Westfield. Also check out The View bar, just a block away. Mel's Diner is also just a block away, as are two theater complexes. The hop-on tour bus stops right outside the hotel door. Only a couple of negatives: hot water for the shower would sometimes run out, and for some bizarre reason the huge bathroom didn't have any counter space. Overall, clean and comfortable with lots to do nearby.

Great location and staff!
Stayed at some higher priced hotels in the area before and first time staying at the Super 8. I have to say that it was a pleasant stay since location is central to the areas I intended on visiting during my stay. Uber was ~$8-$10 for everywhere I wanted to go (pier 39, chinatown, etc...). Staff was friendly and helpful since  the time I walked through the lobby doors. I understand that the building is older and stuff, I would say it was a good bang for the buck and would stay again.

Good location and value
Staff was pleasant, room clean although small -however my accessible bathroom was huge.  Elevator needs repair.  Free breakfast was reasonable, although the dining area was too small. Great location!  2 blocks to Union Square, transportation and variety of restaurants nearby.

Cute hotel close to union square 
The location of the hotel is awesome ! You walk to union square in a few minutes and still it's pretty quiet out at night . Hotel staff is friendly and helpful and the room was clean and cute . I'm saying "cute" because it was rather small but it was more than enough for our stay . The only thing was we extended our stay for a night and the cleaning personal kept on knocking and yelling on the door while we were still sleeping and we had to talk to them and explain for a long Time because their English wasn't the greatest ! Apart from
That miscommunication between hotel and employees it was a very good stay !

Checked in and got on elevator which is expired, safety doc on the wall expired months earlier.  Got to room and discovered it was very small.  no room for luggage, and was very dirty.   Blankets on the bed had something dirty on them.  They charged my credit card a buck in the middle of the night.  I guess that was for sleeping.   checkout was 11am and they called room to make sure we were out .  RUDE ...

Great value for Union Square
My wife and I just stayed here for four days while we were in San Francisco on vacation and I can highly recommend them. We had checked hotel prices for the Union Square area prior to booking and were somewhat shocked at what rooms cost for this area. We also noticed that something like your own bathroom is not necessarily a fact. We read some reviews of other hotels in the area that talked of small rooms and poor service at only $400 and up a night. Then we found Super 8. Yes, the room was small. But it was clean, an older hotel, but clean. It had it's own bathroom. It included a basic breakfast. Not a fancy breakfast but very probably what most people would have on a daily basis at home. Worked for me. Check in was good, bed was comfortable, in the area that we wanted to stay in and the price was more than reasonable. I'd stay here again.

Pictures are deceiving! YIKES!
There was no parking for the hotel unless you wanted to pay $35 for valet and there was a nightclub or something on the other side of the wall.  There are people smoking crack pipes on the front stoop of the hotel.  The room was barely big enough to fit your suitcase in and still have room to walk around the bed.  The continental breakfast was a joke and there was a gap under the door big enough to see under the door.  I was 50/50 expecting to wake up with bed bugs.  There was dried loogies on the wall by the trash can and the elevator smelled strongly of urine.

Location, location, location near Union Sq, SF
I have stayed most of the hotels in the neighborhood.
This is the low key, affordable hotel in the area. Conveniently located. As other reviews said it is at the boarder of Tenderloin area - it is San Francisco so deal with it.
Not like the other hotels across the street, this hotel is not updated as boutique hotel.
It is comfortable and not as tiny as some of the hotels Union Square East.
Old building with budget conscious operation - good enough for my business stay for a few nights.
People at front desk are friendly and professional enough.
Room is clean but I would expect upgrade/replacement of furniture and carpet sometime soon.
All equipment works as it should. Don't expect high-end boutique hotel service, then you will be okay.

Surprisingly quiet hotel close to the airport
We stayed here for a trip to San Francisco as it was better bang for your buck than what you can get in the city proper. The room was clean, bed was super comfortable, and for being so close to the airport it was really quite quiet. They have a restaurant and grab-n-go downstairs near the entrance, which was very convenient when we wanted to hit the road early one morning. Our A/C unit was loud and rumbly and it did feel like the hotel nickled and dimed us for every other service in order to make up for their lower prices. Still, we all agreed it was a great place to stay.

Charged an unexpected "Urban Fee" of $85.50 onto our card. I said that was wrong but no concern by them. Bathroom tiny and sink partially blocked by a column. The room was clean and bed was very comfy. Only 2 1/2 blocks from Union Square. To the immediate south was the Tenderloin district with homeless people, so keep away from that direction.

$500 in unexpected fees.
Beds were labeled as queen sized but were barely a full size. Rooms and bathrooms are extremely small and out dated. The hotel is too short to be able to have a nice view. The windows aren't sealed very well at all. We heard CONSTANT screaming and or fights outside of the hotel ALL night EVERY night. I wouldn't say the hotel is in Union Square, I'd say it's more in the Tenderloin area - which is the ghetto. 
When I arrived to the hotel, there were ADDITIONAL charges of $50 per night + $25 per night + another tax/fee percentage. These hidden fees amounted to an additional $500! 
Definitely would not stay at the Serrano again or recommend this hotel to anyone.

beautiful hotel downtown near everything
Loved this hotel. We are from Orange County, just wanted an overnight in San Fran and to visit UC Berkeley where my daughter plans on attending. We were able to get parking directly across the street for $39 overnight so that was nice. The restaurant next to Hotel, Jasper;s was not all that great and expensive and just know it is more a bar not a food place but there are so many restaurants close by and Chinese food delivery to the hotel is always a great thing. The staff were wonderful and helpful and really nice. I loved our room. We got a room w/ double beds that were very comfortable - everything you need is here. We stayed in room 716 and really enjoyed the stay.. Thank you to everyone at The Serrano for a wonderful stay.

Didn't live up to rating
Ok...a bit tired and on the edge of a seedy neighborhood. The rooms are small and the clientele mixed (i.e., business travelers on a budget to a large group of European male tourist pulling a cooler filled with beer asking the lobby attendant if there was a pool).  If you are driving be prepared to pay $50 per day for parking in the lots next to and across from the hotel. Around the corner you can find one for $30. Functional but not relaxing.

Honestly, the only real negative was parking and the "amenities" fee. Parking on site is $58 per night and "amenities" fee is $25 per night. As far as I know I've never drunk $25 worth of coffee in a week... never mind a night but that seemed to be the only "amenity" I was privy to. 
Otherwise, the staff is great, the hotel is beautiful and centrally located to all of the fun touristy things to do. Room was impeccably clean. On site dining was also very good.

This was the second stay for me at this hotel.  The first was before having twin baby girls!  Both stays were wonderful and the staff is consistently great.  This hotel offer little for children and while the first level restaurant does have good food, the variety in selection is missing.  I will stay at this hotel again, just not with the kids.  Everything was worth the price, except the cost of parking which is really about supply and demand rather than the hotel "choosing" to charge an large price.

Great location.  Staff service needs some work. 
Overall was happy with stay primarily due to location near Union and overall price.  Biggest concerns were staff and checkin.  I purchased a luxury suite for 3.  When I arrived and they assigned me my room I asked specifically if it was the luxury suite. They said yes.  When I got to the room it didn't seem right.  Went back down and another person said no, that was a smaller room but they ran out and had one out of service.  So rather than telling me the truth they were deceptive.  When I asked how the would compensate for the difference they said they couldn't since I prepaid.  Yeah, right!

Next day they moved us to the proper suite for the next 4 nights and only provided $25 of compensation.  Amazing.

Then issues with housecleaning not cleaning my room when I asked because of a mix up with their enviro program.  Front desk assured me it would be cleaned but after returning to room in late afternoon it still wasn't done.

Finally, rooms are a little worn, but nice.  Biggest complaint is the quality of the mattresses.  Very worn and old and uncomfortable.  And the pullout couch had springs poking out of it.

Location was great.  Price was fair, but I wouldn't stay again

We Had a wonderful vacation in San Francisco and could easily get to all sites worth seeing from our hotel at Parc 55. The only thing for travelers to know is it is an expensive hotel. They don't give a continental breakfast in fact except the room coffee. you have to pay $2 for coffee in the lobby (save the cup for refills) $7 for grab n go, bagels, muffins ect. The big shocker was the hot breakfast buffet for $32/ person. Other than that the place was great and had alternatives for breakfast right out the front door.

When we got to the hotel we couldn't find a convenient place to park so we had to use their valet parking, which was way more than we are normally used to paying.  Checking in and getting to our room was easy, but when we wanted to eat dinner we chose the in hotel restaurant.  The food was good, but the serving sizes were small compared to what they cost.  Next time I'd rather stay at a a motel with onsite parking.

Not only that, there were not a single socket near the desk. Their Internet was sloooow. The valet parking people aren't so kind................

Good location, nice rooms, hotel is a little dated
Bad check in experience. Arrived at 4:30, check in time as 4pm. Was told no king rooms available except for a corner room which would cost an extra $40 a night. I passed on that, they said they would text me when a room came available. The wife & I went to the bar and waited. An hour later after noticing people walking up and getting rooms I asked again and yes they had rooms available now and yet no one had texted me.

Took my girlfriend for a Saturday night stay-vacation for her birthday in the city and the St. Regis was an excellent place to stay. The staff was great and accommodating. The St. Regis restaurant Grill was fantastic. The morning breakfast in the Vitrine Restaurant was fabulous.

Weekend in San Francisco!
We thought we'd try the recently renovated St Regis at the end of our cycling trip to Napa and Sonoma. Though only there for two nights, we couldn't have asked for a more luxurious spot. Arriving in jeans and looking quite disheveled after a morning ride, we were treated no differently than anyone else. Our check in was smooth, pleasant and our room was even ready early. We were even offered their private car service for dinner with friends the following evening. The pool is lovely and salt water. Breakfast is on the fourth floor, something we didn't find on our first morning because the information in the room directs you to the bar area in the lobby for coffee and continental breakfast. Loved the room decor. Simplistic and modern with all of the conveniences one would expect in a 5 star hotel.

The very best hotel in San Francisco, California
Whether traveling or scheduling a special occasion event, this is the absolute best spot to stay in San Francisco. Elegant, luxurious and well appointed. Beautiful, serene and very clean accomadations. The staff are top-notch and take the very best care of you with exceptional service, considerations and prompt attention to any request. It was my husbands birthday and the hotel staff was so gracious in taking the time to make sure we had an exceptional stay and it was. The spa and pool are also fabulous and a great way to refresh and renew, we look forward to returning as much as possible when traveling to the area. The best of SF❤️

Excellent San Francisco Hotel, Stay, Location!
We usually only stay at the St. Regis whenever we go to SF. We love it there. The rooms are amazing, the hotel staff is terrific and everything about the stay was perfect. For this trip, we only booked a regular room since we knew we'd be quite busy and not really in the room very much. We did ask when we checked in if there were any upgrades available. They gave us a 4-level upgrade to a "Metropolitan Suite". OMG, the room was fabulous, the butler service was amazing, the private dining was fantastic. Can't say anything but wonderful things about this stay.

Our room was near a service area and quite noisy. The closet was very small. The bathroom was small-towels & rug in bathroom were frayed. The room definitely needs some updates. I just expected more at the rate of $700 plus a night. Usually stay at 4 Seasons. In my opinion there is no comparison.

The St. Regis met all of our expectations! The staff was consistently helpful and polite, the location is great for shopping and restaurants, and the house car was a great bonus to get to North Shore or Fishermans Warf for extra dinner options (tip: take the house car, which is a luxury auto, to dinner and then take Uber Black back to your hotel).  Overall, this was a first-class hotel!

Our stay at the St. Regis was better than expected. The room was very comfortable and the bathroom spacious. The hotel staff were professional and welcoming from the time we arrived to the time we left. The short walk to Union Square was great  and from there a cable car ride away from Fisherman's Wharf. I would recommend this hotel to everyone I know going to San Francisco for a visit.

I can't figure out why this hotel is so expensive.
I had checked ahead about drinks and a light meal upon arrival and was assured the XYZ Bar (or whatever it was called) would be open late. We had traveled for 21 hours from Nice, France and were in need of winding down. At midnight we arrived with many other travelers (SF Airport location) to find that even though the bar was full of people, it had just closed. Saturday night in SF with travelers pouring into the hotel from all points on the globe, all of us hungry and thirsty, but no amenities and no room service. Are they interested in their customers having a pleasant experience or getting their wait staff home early to bed? In the future I will pick a larger hotel that has facilities open later, or at the very least, has room service.

The staff was not as helpful as they could have been in check in.  My 1st trip to San Francisco & staff assumed I knew how to get around when I didn't.  There was a big party going on at the hotel and there was no parking.  The first time I had a card that was not the insert type and a quick example on how to use these types of cards would have helped.

The hotel offered a free shuttle to the airport which also meant it shuttled you to the Bart which I found extremely beneficial. The only thing I would have to say it needed was coffee in the lobby for free 24/7 you had the option to purchase a latte or mocha from the fancy machine but there wasn't the coffee option 24/7. Other than that the hotel staff was wonderful and just what I expected! I was nervous when I read others reviews about the noise of the airplanes but honestly I barely heard them at all.

Deceptive pricing in a low-end version of luxury
When you get to the hotel, the first thing you see is a bar, a literal red-and-white striped physical barrier that prevents you from entering.  Next to it is a sign that says: $X/hour, $YY/day to even enter the lot.

The cost was higher before we even checked in.  That, to me, is RIDICULOUSLY deceptive.  It's located very close to the airport, with tightly controlled areas all about (razor wire) so it was about 4 blocks away when we found a parking spot, we timed it, an 11 minute walk away.  Took less time to drive to the airport than to get to our car from the hotel.

It was a mostly new facility.  Clean.  Nice colors and very refreshing design.  For the advertised price, it was an OK deal, and very conveniently located.  For the actual cost with parking, I would not have chosen it, it would be far above the acceptable price.

The staff was mostly clueless though: they didn't understand or even acknowledge or want to discuss there was a problem arriving to find out the rate was a full **ZZ% higher** than I'd agreed.  They said, "we allow a 15 minute grace period to check in, for free."  I did not see that on any sign when trying to enter, but that wasn't even the point.  You're trapped there and either pay the extra or park 4 blocks away.

I've replaced all reference to the actual costs, percentages and prices with XX YY and ZZ, (per Expedia policy preventing reviews with prices).  This is part of the problem!  Be transparent.

Loved all outside, but inside, if you want to stay all day, there are no movie channels, no restaurant, or food service in the actual hotel. You give all your business to the West in Hotel. Then you go eat over there, and you end up having your cocktails over there. Might as well get a room at the Westin, right?
I loved the place because I had company, but if I went by myself, it would have been blah!

This hotel was good value for the money.  Although older, this hotel has had many upgrades over the years and we were very comfortable there.  The room and bathroom were small but very clean/comfortable and well appointed.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  Location was very convenient to union square area, powell street cable cars, various car rental, and lots of good restaurants.  Just note that homelessness is a big problem in San Francisco and this area is especially so.  No big problems though and we would stay again for the price we paid compared to other area hotels.

Would definitely recommend.
We recently stayed at King George for 2 nights and had a great time.  The room we had (Superior Room, 1 Queen Bed) was definitely not the biggest hotel room as we read in some reviews, but we did not plan on spending a ton of time in the room anyways.  There was definitely enough space for what you need (small walk-in and lots of storage under the bed).  The bed was honestly one of the comfiest beds we have ever slept in!    Bathroom was tiny but again, all you need and very clean.  Our room was ready when we arrived in San Fran around 11am which was awesome and staff was great. Location wise, it is right by everything you need (transit, restaurants and shopping).  There are homeless people honestly anywhere you go in San Fran - one street is good then another is a tad shady.  We were not bothered by any of them right by the hotel.  A minor downside to the hotel is the elevator.  As the hotel has an older feel which I really liked, the elevator is quite tiny and very slow which can be a negative if you have a big group or lots of luggage or are older.  The stairs are very narrow and windy which gave us an added leg workout along with walking around San Fran!  We would stay here again and recommend it to someone looking for a hotel.

The staff hotel and location are fantastic for San Francisco, very clean and comfortable, close to all transport and Westfield which has a great food court. We highly recommend this hotel but suggest you don't get a room at the front due to street noise, we had one at the back but were told by others the front was noisy.

No elevator, NOT for anyone with leg issues!
Received call from site asking if we were coming. Delayed by LA and SF traffic 2.5 hours for 9 PM check in. Take their call or your room may disappear. Upon arrival, learned site is not handicap accessible. Miserable for 3 of us that shared recent injured knees, and/or knee surgery. Room on 3rd floor was nice with overlook of bar next door. Only ice machine broken for some time. Nice fridge,microwave,coffee maker. Room comfy, but narrow. Parking is poor/more narrow, and if you do not get there early each night, you must fight for street parking. Staff not up on local tourist spots, advising cable car rides were $60 to $100/ each. Pamphlet supply next to them was great/helpful. They did know where post office was though. Breakfast was okay (yogurt/prepack cereal/pastry, apple/oranges, juice bottles, and you must pick up in lobby. Few restaurants in area so bring food if coming late. Stunned that SF closes many places at 6 PM now. The  town is losing it's touch. Good hotel for those with good legs and light luggage - which we were not. Would not recommend for family with young kids.

Great for a business stay!
Quick check in by helpful clerk. This is a motel and while the parking area is open to the public access to the rooms area requires a key, this provided me with a greater sense of security. 
The room was clean and the decor was attractive and fresh. There was a  TV, refrigerator & blow dryer. I don't recall an alarm/clock, but I used my phone for that anyway.
No closet but there is a hanging rack with hangars. The sink area was clean and fairly modern. The toilet / shower room was clean as well and even has a window up in the ceiling to let light in. 
The motel is old, I believe 3 stories high (The lower story being parking) and is well maintained. The neighborhood was what could be expected for downtown San Francisco. A decent continental breakfast was served (and much appreciated!) That included packaged pastries, fresh fruit, small yogurt cups and refrigerated fruit juice.
Although I was not cold, my only complaint is that there is no bed spread, just sheets and blanket. Also the weather stripping could use some refreshing. I was there for 1 night on business, slept well, ate nearby and was just a mile or so from Moscone Center so the cab ride was quick or I could have walked of I wanted.

Biz traveller that has stayed at more 'upscale(?)' hotels in the area and they don't provide the amenities this place does. Coffee machine, microwave, refrigerator.  Very handy when your travel in each month for a week.   Wish I had found this place 10months ago!

Very quiet, simple, and pleasant.
Modest, simple type of setting. Good location. You'll have to walk a ways to find good restaurants. The cleaning crew kind of wait very late before cleaning room around early afternoon. I like the quiet setting, good accommodations and amenities.

Not too bad after all 
You get what you pay for !!!! Pretty nice hotel with free parking lots small one , first come first serve but we didn't have to park outside in 3 nights !!!! Staff members are friendly but some of house keeper they keep chatting while they are working just outside my room !!!! So the noises of traffic , construction nearby , and staff chatting is a little bit annoying , nice and clean bathroom but the floor need an upgrade !!!!
I'll think about stay here next time in SF

Great place to stay if you're not picky
I was in town for only the one night and it was close to all the places I wanted to go. There's a bus stop to the Exploratorium a block and a half away and it's 5 minutes walking distance to Trader Joe's, FYI. There is no elevator, there's 15 stair steps up to the room, but if you're planning on walking around SF all day anyway, what's a few more steps? The stairway is secure (room key needed). The parking lot is not secure. There is limited parking (a dozen spaces?) and it's first come, first served, so get there early (it's free!). The room was old, but very clean. More amenities than I expected (iron, ironing board, hair dryer, hangers, suitcase stand, outlets in the nightstand lamps' bases). The A/C is very loud, but I didn't use it while sleeping so it didn't matter. The traffic noise was barely noticeable even though all the rooms are close to the street. Free continental breakfast (6:00 - 10:00 AM) was pre-packaged danishes, instant oatmeal, dry cereal, fruit, milk, apple juice, orange juice, tea, and coffee. You'll need to bring it back to your room because it's just in the front desk area (there's no lobby). I interacted with 3 different staff persons on the phone and in person and all of them were friendly. Would definitely stay there again for what I got for the price I paid.

Nice clean hotel that was close to AT&T park. Front desk staff was so friendly and helpful. For the price we will stay again. The only problem is hotel parking, not enough spaces for hotel guest if it's full. You have to find street parking, which made us nervous.

SF Disappointment
We had a good experience with the front counter lady the first day as she was very helpful and even was able to fix the TV which did not receive all the standard channels. She was very nice but the lady there on check out was not pleasant at all,

Also this may have been the smallest room we ever stayed in so we are glad we did not have more luggage. 

Overall a rather disappointing experience

Nice discount motel for stay in San Francisco
We spent 2 nights in San Francisco and were on a budget. We needed a cheap motel that was not a dump or in a dangerous area of town. This motel was suitable. 

It has pros and cons. 
The motel is about 5-6 blocks from Market Street where you can catch metro (BART,) bus & street cars (which will take you to Fisherman's Wharf), so plan to walk. No shuttle was available, so we walked to the BART station 6 blocks away to travel to the airport.
There is no elevator, so it is not handicapped accessible. The rooms are all on the 2nd and 3rd floors and you need a room card to access the stairs, which provides security. Parking is on the ground level, but we didn't drive in so we did not need to use it.
Near Hwy 101, so it's pretty noisy at night if you are a light sleeper. It didn't bother me but it kept my son awake.
Breakfast is provided, but includes mostly carbs and little protein, so diabetics need to eat elsewhere.

Room good, staff not
Although I mentioned I had a lot of luggage (4 items for 1 person) & I had specifically requested for a quite room away from the freeway, the check-in staff gave me a room on the 4th floor at the farthest end of the building & closest to the freeway !   After moving there, I came back & asked for a 1st floor room & away from freeway, after some grumbling about it, they complied & I had to move all my stuff again.  Asked for a wake call to be set up, said it was done, but the phone never rang in the morning, fortunately I had also set up an alarm on the clock radio & that worked.   Was supposed to get a free water bottle, was never offered one until I saw another guest getting it & when I asked, then I was given 1.  Staff generally not friendly.  Room was good condition, clean & bed comfortable

Not what expected but would stay again
The photos made this hotel look much nicer than it actually is.  However, the staff was nice, the room was clean, looked like fresh decor, wall paper, paint, etc. Appliances were in good shape & working well, safe in the room. We had an upstairs room, it was pretty quiet. Bathroom is super small, bed & pillows were not the best. Also, couldn't get the wiFi to work on our Apple devices, only our laptop. Weird. Best part is that it's walking distance to a nice downtown area with lots of good eateries and sidewalk cafés. Despite the room being small and boring, I would stay here again for its other amenities and the nice staff and the cleanliness of the facility.

Older hotel with some updates. Good water pressure, and everything in the room worked. Staff were very friendly. Located on busy street just across from train tracks, but staff put us in a corner room away from the street for less noise. It was the best of the "value" motels we've stayed at in the area.  No elevator to 2nd floor, which would bar anyone who couldn't climb stairs.

They serve the breakfast after seven, I think is because most of the people will be gone, the breakfast is very poor, mini muffins, mini bagels, no milk (only if you eat cereal), room is a little smelly, I don't know if is because they smoke outside and the smoke goes inside the room as well.

Tiny new hotel tucked away inside an old building
I stayed here during GDC 2016. The hotel had just opened - it was so new that they didn't yet have permanent signage, and I had trouble finding the place because I wasn't looking for the temporary signage inside the window. The continental breakfast included hot eggs and meat, although the quality was just barely enjoyable. Overall it was clean and new, but no-frills. Perfect for a trip where you want a clean and comfortable room downtown, but won't be spending much time in the hotel.

Beware of double charging your credit card
Paid Expedia for hotel + flight.  A few days after checking out I noticed a charge for $628.64 from Holiday Inn Express.  I was double charged for the room.  I called Expedia and they said it was not their fault and to call the hotwl.  Called Holiday Inn Express Union Square and spoke with Marcelo who told me that someone made a mistake and it should have been charged to third party "Expedia", but only th manager Raj can fix it.  He said he would email Raj to fix it and call me back.  Raj never has called so I filled a dispute with my credit card company.  Neither Expedia nor Holiday Inn Express seem to want to fix the problem...stressful to the customer and poor customer service!!

Pool guy visits San Francisco
This hotel is right on the border of Chinatown and Union Square  these are the best places for shopping and dining in the city   With the hotel centrally located you can take any number of public transportation to get around you can take the cable car, A streetcar  A double-decker bus or a cab if you like and be anywhere in the city in about 10 minutes 
My wife and I suggest if you're going to spend more than a couple days to buy a three day pass and you can ride any form of public transportation for 1 fee this does not include taxis or ferry service  we both highly recommend the Alcatraz tour  we stayed at the Orchard Garden very clean hotel very nice staff room was very small and wasn't impressed with it at all but the cleanly Ness and the staff  made up for it also wasn't impressed with the TV but you don't go to San Francisco  to watch TV so this worked out  overall was one of the best trips we've ever had people in  San Francisco were great it was a second honeymoon for me and my wife also if you have the chance bike across the Golden gate Bridge and go to Sausalito  they rent bikes at fisherman's wharf and you can bike to Sausalito and take a ferry back for a good time that is the ticket If we had more time we would spend it in Sausalito thanks for reading our review the pool guy

The hotel is conveniently located next to the Dragon Gate and a few blocks from Union Square. It's spacious and extremely clean.

Nice hotel, antique decor, and great architecture!
This is a very nice hotel, in a historic building, very close to Union square, in the heart of downtown San Francisco. Rooms are rather small, due to the location (everything tends to be small, by American standards, in San Francisco) but they are comfortable. Coffee is served in the hall in the morning, and wine tasting in the late afternoon, as in the tradition of the Kimpton Hotels. The bathroom was extremely small. Overall, I did like the hotel. The price was acceptable through a secret deal, but would be on the rather pricey level directly from the hotel. But, again, this is the heart of downtown San Francisco.

Great location and historic hotel
Loved: big room, large closet, fabulous view, comfortable bed, decor, wine hour and location.

Disliked: Cramped elevators and only one of the four seemed to be operating. This led to long waits and lines. Also, while our room was lovely, the bathroom was exceedingly small, making use of the toilet awkward.

Close to the action
My sister, cousins and I stayed here for one night when we went to the Giants game. Great location near Union Square and we were able to walk to ATT park. Beds were nice, but bathroom is very small. Shades/blinds definitely need to be updated as they were difficult to pull up to look at our view of rooftops and Macy's. Parking/Valet could be a problem on busy Powell Street.

Overpriced and overrated
Our room was worn and torn.  Paint was peeling, blistering and in some places missing altogether (spackle in the bathroom left unpainted).  Carpet was torn.  The bed had a big dip in it and was not comfortable.  The desk was flimsy.  The window was filthy and made it hard to enjoy the view.  This is not a four-star hotel.  I will contact Expedia about a credit or partial refund.  The staff, however, were friendly and helpful.

Excellent hotel for the area and price
The Sir Francis Drake is located in Union Square and there are hundreds of resturants and bars within a few blocks. The hotel is older but well maintained and they embrace the theme so it doesn't seem like the hotel is as old as it is. The room was large and the bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was small but very functional. The lobby bar was always busy and seemed like a nice hangout for the area. Also the starlight room is on the 21st floor and the patrons take the same elevators as guests. I found this a little off putting as I was in the elevator with about 10 unsavory characters. I would definitely recommend the Drake as it is probably the most affordable in the area and really doesn't skimp on amenities. I love Kimpton Hotels and stay at one anytime I have a chance. As with all Kimptons there is a free wine social everyday from 5-6 and they are very pet friendly. This was a wonderful stay and experience in SanFran.

Great location!
This was our first trip to San Francisco and we didn't have any idea where to stay.This hotel is in a great location.  You can easily take the F Market line to Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39 or to any of the tour locations (hop on-hop off bus, wine tour bus, bike riding tour over the Golden Gate Bridge).  The cable car stops right out front of the hotel.  The hotel has coffee and tea in the lobby each morning and a wine happy hour each evening.  The rooms are older but very clean.  The staff is excellent.

Gorgeous and classy, prohibition era hotel. 
Great room, albeit tiny, even though we booked the 'Deluxe' on 20th floor with city views. Views were ok, room was decadent. We were warned about nightclub music from 21st floor, though heard next to nothing. We had been offered lower room with smaller beds upon check-in, plus $60 hotel credit. Took 20th floor anyway and we were glad we did. Front desk threw in $60 hotel credit at last minute regardless. Kids ordered gelato with caramel sauce (gelato - $7, topping - $2  x 2 = $18), came out to nearly $30 with service charge and delivery fee!!! Hubby and I had one cocktail a piece at bar downstairs, came out to $25 with tip. So there went the hotel credit! We did enjoy a couple of glasses of wine each during the complimentary wine hour from 5-6. Overall, nice hotel in nice part of SF. We'd stay there again.

OK hotel but hotel staff failed
The hotel is nice.  We had reservations at 9am so we called the front desk to schedule a wake up call which is a very common request for hotels.  We never received the wake up call and we missed out reservations and had to rethink our vacation plans for that day.  This was the first hotel we have ever experienced this problems with and it was very disappointing.

Great location at a great price
Stayed two nights in San Francisco for a quick getaway. I chose the Sir Francis Drake because of its central location, and because I got a great price from Experia. This is my third time here since it has become a Kimpton hotel. The hotel is a classic hotel, refurbished, but with old San Francisco charm (wooden elevator doors on floors above the lobby, the iconic doormen). 

Room size is more European standard than American suburban standard (i.e. smallish) which suited me fine. All fixtures worked well, and the hotel provided all amenities. If you have a room that fronts Powell Street, you will hear the cable cars running by, which I enjoyed, but if you are sensitive to street sounds you may want a room away from Powell.

Disappointment by the Bay
I stayed at the Sir Francis Drake for three nights with my mother and daughter for her high school graduation trip.   The bellman was very helpful as was the front desk staff who allowed us to check in early.  That was the extent of our pleasant experience.  That evening, my mother pulled back the linens on her bed to find DIRTY sheets.  We called the front desk.  They said they couldn't help; she would need to call housekeeping.  We did.  It was 11:00 PM.  Thirty minutes later we still didn't have clean linens.  She called again.  Apparently there was a shift change, and the message wasn't relayed.  Ten minutes later a man arrived with clean linens, but he was unable to change the sheets because that was "not his job."  Truly, he said that.  The bartenders were rude and inefficient causing for long waits and small drinks.  The bathroom was very small.  There were no glasses or cups in our room. No coffee pot.  Far from a four star experience.

I have stayed at the Marker in the past and was incredibly impressed with everything about it. Thinking it would be the same great experience, I returned. I understand it has changed ownership twice in the year since my last visit. The new owners have missed the mark. Understaffed, lack of personalization for the most part. James at the bell desk/valet and the night security guard were the only staff that even acknowledged the guests.

Wonderful Experience and Close to Everything!
Spent two nights at the The Marker on a family trip to the city.  We had a great experience from the moment we stepped out of our car.  From the Valet to the folks at the front desk, not only was the service perfect, they made it personal and fun!  For example, the manager spent time going through the "Treasure Chest" with my son to find the perfect toy for him to enjoy during his stay.  In addition, he also took the time to share with us a lot about the city. 

Our room was in perfect condition.  Beautiful, clean furnishings and it was very quiet for a city hotel.  I will certainly stay at this location again.  It truly is a very good location to get to a variety of places in the city on foot or by public transport.  Plus the other folks staying that we met were also very friendly and hip which also makes it fun.

Lacks Attention to Detail
Our room and bedding was comfortable and clean and they have obviously gone to some effort to update the hotel. Unfortunately, the TV, fridge, phone and table lamp did not work (a loose plug issue); it took two trips to the front desk before it was mostly fixed but never quite got there. Another reviewer pointed out the channel selection on the TV leaves a bit to be desired. Much is made of their "amenities", for which they shamelessly propose to charge an additional $20/day - for internet (which appears in several places on the Expedia webpage as "free", so read the fine print), bicycles (in hilly SF? um, ok...), telephone calls (people use their cell phones) and a few other "standards" in other hotels like a fitness room. The wine hour was a nice touch, but fairly common in SF: it is whisked away promptly at 6 pm, 6:01 is too late, so sorry. The morning coffee was tepid. To their credit, the front desk agreed to waive the charge when I pointed these things out to them. I think they are trying hard, but need to up their game on the small things, much less charge people extra for them.

One of the worst experience
This is my first review ever.  I usually don't leave reviews but this hotel stay was the worst.  This is a highly priced hotel, obviously your expectations are a little high.  Pillows are so terrible.  Even two pillow will make you feel like you are laying on the floor.  The bed it self is so old.  When you turn you can actually hear the springs.  This is just the start.  We finally managed to sleep around 1:00 AM.  At 2:30 AM Fire Alarm went off.  The whole seventh floor was suppose to be evacuated but not a single staff member were to be found on seventh floor.  When all of us managed to make it downstairs to Main lobby, No one knew what was going on except one person at front desk.  We waited in the lobby for almost an hour just to find out that it was false alarm.  If this is a high class hotel, then what is security doing?  Some one pulled the fire alarm and ran with out the security catching them?  After all of that drama, right at 9:00 AM, room cleaning staff kept knocking on my door.  Even though the check out time is not until 12 noon.  She knocked for good 3 minutes until I finally woke and managed to open the door and tell her that we are not checking out until 12 noon.  Did not sleep that night.  When checking out and told the person that I had a terrible experience at this hotel,  He said "I am sorry, we will just refund your emanity fees"  Which is 3% compare to what I  paid for the hotel.  This was really bad experience.

Trying to be upscale but falls short
The Marker is trying to be a cool, chic, trendy hotel.  And in some ways, it does so but falls down on the details.  For such an expensive hotel, they need to get the basics right.  First, we had a "premium" queen room.  I fail to see what was premium about it.  The bed was clearly smaller than a Queen and snug for two people.  The bathroom lacked flash and was just ok (old school bathtub with shower curtain and small).  No private toilet here so be ready to be intimate with your roommate.  Small details like electrical plates broken or not attached (cheap and ugly) were not attended to.  The room was small and our view was the wall of the building next door.  The television service was scant featuring some 15 channels.  Not much to brag about.
On the bright side, the staff was friendly.  Happy hour complimentary wine was served downstairs each evening and coffee in the morning.  Not a bad place, but not up to the standard of a modern cool hotel.  No comparison to the Parker, W, or other such hotels.  I won't stay there again.

Fine, but not 4 star. 
Starting with the location...I was in a panic when I driver pulled up to the hotel. It was dark and there were homeless people everywhere. The hotel security came out to the car to escort us inside. The hotel itself is an older building that has been restored. Overall, a very cute place. The rooms are small with very limited storage. I had to leave the suit cases out all week because there is zero room in the closet. Drawer storage was equivalent to two night stand drawers. The bathroom itself was tiny and needs to be redone. Overall it was mainly just worn. 

While the hotel in conveniently located just two blocks from Union Sqare, it's a rough two blocks. We made sure that we were back inside before dark each night. Even during the day the walk is dirty and smells strongly of urine. In addition you will encounter many homeless individuals asking for money about every 20 feet. 

The hotel staff was friendly. We never asked for much to really rate their quality. The $30 amenity fee was a joke. Really you are paying $30 for wireless access and flavored water in the lobby. There is a restaurant and bar attached to the hotel, but it was open limited hours. The drinks that we had from there were fine, but we didn't feel that the menu had many options. The Walgreens across the street was the closest thing that we had to room service. 

I would not recommend this hotel for people with children, or anyone not completely accustom to city life.

Hotel was nice. Got to our hotel late at night looked for the tv remote couldn't find one. Waited until morning to tell front desk. There was nothing by the phone on how to call the desk. So I went down stairs to tell them we had no remote. They had a drawer of remotes. Breakfast is packaged oatmeal, coffee, packaged muffins. Pool area could have been cleaner, found hair in pool. Gross. Liked that there was no maids coming into our room. Just brought towels to front desk for clean ones. Hotel location was nice because it was off the highway, but the area was run down except for the nice target.

To get the space you pay with location
It's better value in terms of room size and comfort to make a booking outside San Fran, but San Rafael is not a great base for exploration, if you're not driving that is. The hotel is within sight and earshot of busy motorways, making it feel like a motel, a stop-over. In fact, it's a comfortable place with pool and laundry room and whatever, but so what when it takes 2 hours to get to San Francisco? You have to catch a bus into San Rafael (or walk 45mins!) and then another to go to San Francisco. And each bus seems to come once an hour! Matching the bus which will get you back from San Rafael to the hotel is a matter requiring careful research, because nobody walks in America! 

Room cleaning was but once a week (they failed to remove our box of recycling) and WIFI unsecured, but all the same, the staff were friendly and helpful, the coffee and muffins - though very basic - were as fine a way to breakFAST! as one could wish, and there's a lovely bayside walk in 5-10 mins walk, and the San Rafael bus depot can get you into the swelteirng wine country.

This was only hotel available in the area at time of our stay. It is serviceable no extras including housekeeping. iIf you wanted fresh towels you had to exchange at the front desk. The same with pots, pans, or dishes you had to get from front my desk as well. Grab and go breakfast included coffee, prepackaged muffins and granola bars, and fresh apples and oranges.

Cheaply Constructed Room, Poor Continental Breakfa
Disappointed in the room because of the low quality materials used in construction of the room - fake granite counter tops, fake wood linoleum floor not real wood, furniture appeared to be made of pressed particle board not real wood, low standard carpet in bedroom area that retained dirt stains, thin glass shower stall door that was bowed so leaked water onto floor, bathroom floor linoleum curling at the edges because of excess water from shower, bathroom mirror was small to save money, light-weight lamps that were difficult to turn on by pushbutton because they slid when button was pushed, small, thin towels not thick or luxurious, thin sheets and pillow cases, small TV to save money.  Also disappointed in the room because of the room condition - refrigerator was dented in several places, lamp shades were torn, front door did not fully shut to lock position had to manually pull door shut to lock.  Disappointed in the parking - not enough parking spaces, all parking spaces taken on Saturday night, had to park in front of lobby door.  Disappointed in the continental breakfast - RV parks offer better.  Will never stay here again.  Will never recommend to relatives or friends.

I stayed there as I planned to travel to San Fransisco the next day. I did not realize that crossing the Golden Gate bridge from North to South required tolls. But I like everything else about the hotel. The staff are really nice. The hotel provides pans and plates etc, and it has laundry rooms as well. The breakfast was pretty good too.

Great Place to stay!
We typically pay $250 or more a night in San Francisco with obscene parking fees that do not have in and out privileges and at minimum $15,00 for wifi, and the business office fees are high. This hotel/extended stay is approximately 35 min. from SF (with light traffic). The location is  great, free wifi, no parking fees, located close to many stores and restaurants and it is an all around great stay. We never expected to like the hotel and chose it because we knew we would be spending very little time there and we found we liked it better than the hotels where we typically stay in SF. There is a full refrigerator, microwave, great view of the water, the beds were very comfortable and they have (free continental breakfast) excellent coffee brewing, hot tea, water for oatmeal, oranges, apples, muffins and breakfast bars at not cost from 6:00 a.m. - 9:30 a.m. The facility is not fancy but it is very clean and instead of having a $1000.00+ bill for three days our total bill was $315! There is housekeeping only if you stay eight or more days and you have to turn towels into the front for new supplies/towels, and although we had never been without housekeeping on a daily basis we found we liked the privacy. Getting towels was a a first for us but for the price, it was fine..

Hmnnn well the first room we didn't even get to the door as there was a loud barking dog next door , nope! Then the 2nd room only had one bed when we booked 2 queens for 4 of us. The third room was fine but really disappointed there wasn't even a cofee maker. The guy working was very nice. Trash outside when we first walked in was overflowing. Overall it was OK.  Would pay a bit more for something a bit nicer with full breakfast and a coffee pot!

Nice place to stay for the price
The room, overall, was comfortable. The staff was friendly and available when we needed them. The AC/heating unit was a bit noisy, but only noticeable at night when we were trying to sleep. The price was reasonable, especially when compared to staying in San Fransisco. I would use this hotel again.

Last Resort
Since the super bowl was in the area, hotels were difficult to find and this was a choice of last resort.  It was in an industrial/car maintenance area that had no restaurants or shops nearby.

We thought the extras that this hotel offers (like free bikes, s'mores by the fire pit were awesome). Also Charlie at the reception was very helpful and friendly.

Do NOT Stay here!
Office staff was nice enough  and let us check in early to find a homeless man rummaging through his things and setting up camp outside of our room. We got in our non smoking room to breathe in the air of smokers past and noticed the tears in the carpet, the degraded wall paper/ paint combo that covered the walls in odd spots in a falling off motion and the stains on the blankets and sheets that was probably accompanied by bed bugs. Walked into the bathroom to see the shower that looked like something out of a bad scary movie. Although what did it for us was the cockroach hanging out beside the toilet looking at us like he got there first. Do not stay here!!!

Room hazards, inconveniences, rude employees. 
If you want a suite in San Francisco don't go here. It was dingy and empty. The shower had no room to keep toiletries, the carpet was folded creating a safety hazard, the whole carpet was wet, and they don't give you a comforter blanket. Only sheets and a small tan felt looking blanket. The phone didn't work. There are no easy access outlets at the bedsides for charging your phone. And they are supposed to give you your $100 deposit back the next day, but didn't for me. Also, they took out $100 TWICE and hung up on me when I called to handle it. Completely awful.

The person in the registration desk was gratuitously rude. She almost yelled at me when asking for directions to our room. The next day the hotel did not honor the free breakfast advertised through Expedia. We were three people staying so I definitely plan to make a formal complaint about this. The staff was completely unapologetic about the no free breakfast by merely acknowledging they don't do breakfast anymore. The night stands had something sticky on them and we found a fly in the room. Overall this is not a good place even for the price.

House keeping seemed to be very slow.  Two days in a row, I was out of my room between 7:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. only to return to my room to find that it had not yet been serviced / made up by housekeeping.  One day I had to vacate my room so they could work on it at about 3:00 p.m.  The other day, I needed to use my room and couldn't vacate it in the mid / late afternoon so it was not serviced / made up at all.

We stayed here for my son's graduation from Cal. The hotel staff was nice, and the front desk was decorated with Cal colors and balloons. There is a Trader Joe's right across the street which is really convenient. The rooms are very standard, no mini fridge, no HDTV. Our room smelled very musty, but there was a window so we were able to let fresh air in. The shower/toilet room was tiny and the shower wasn't very clean; the carpet needs to be replaced as well.  Overall, it was fine because we weren't there much, but for the price, we expected more. We won't stay here again even though we visit Berkeley often.

My daughter had just had surgery and we needed to stay nearby overnight. She said she loved how quiet it was and how comfortable the bed was, which she had not expected. I liked the room too, except I thought the bathroom was too small. The next morning they told me that if I had asked for an upgrade by making reservations at the hotel, I could have gotten a larger bath. Also, I did not get my usual senior citizen discount which I get almost everywhere.

FRAUDULENT CHARGES ON MY CREDIT CARD AFTER MY STAY
My mother and I stayed at the hotel a few weeks back.  I used my credit card to pay for the hotel and it was the only time I gave my card or used the card during the entire trip.  We received a call from our credit card company that several charges had been made in the area (Kmart, etc. places I never patronize) with our card number.  Clearly this hotel doesn't have the necessary financial security measures as this is the only place that could have used my number to charge at other merchants.  Pretty disappointing on a hotel.

This hotel is just one half block from Union Square, with tour bus pick ups and public transportation close by.  We found it to be well located for exploring the city.  We were, however, disappointed in the size of the room, which felt cramped, and in the small main lobby.          The weather during our stay was not great,  but this hotel offers no bar and little public space for waiting out the drizzle.

This place had higher ratings than another botique hotel I usually stay at but I think I'd rather stay elsewhere next time. There are no bell boys so be ready to take your bags in yourself. The building is old and not updated, and the room was small with ugly old fixtures in the bathroom. It's a great location but there are several other nearby hotels much nicer around the same range or $20 more.

Hotel showing signs of age
Mostly this hotel was great, especially with Expedia pricing. However our first room had a broken heating unit (heating our room when it was 85 degrees outside) and a broken ceiling fan. Once we changed rooms we were much more comfortable. I will say though that the showers were really inconsistent in both water pressure (either you were getting tinkled on, or you felt like you were being power washed) and temperature (scalding hot, freezing cold, it's anyone's guess). The bed was comfy except for the flimsy pillows, and our room was kept very clean. The location is also amazing, we walked to nearly every major attraction in the first afternoon. I would have greatly enjoyed either a continental breakfast or breakfast room service option (room service in the evening was offered from the ajoining restaurant) as well as some gym amenities. All in all, decent stay.

This is an overall good hotel and would appeal to those with more refined and classic hotel tastes.  It has a theater in it and a high class restaurant next to it as well as being easy walking distance to a number of other different restaurants in the area to suite almost any pallet.

The staff was generally friendly and they have someone come in to play their grand piano a few nights a week which was a nice touch.

In comparison to other hotels we stayed in, this was wonderful. The rooms were clean, the staff was helpful, check in and out was a breeze. Pool was nice, and inside. Lots of towels, goggles provided (awesome) water provided in the gym, and it was good. We managed to get locked out of our room, they escorted us up with our new keys to make sure there were no further problems. We can't complain about anything.

The hotel is very business-like. I would stay there if I were visiting SF on business instead of on holiday.  To the effect, the rooms were almost sound proof and perfect for a good night's sleep. The hotel staff was beyond curteous but not annoyingly so. My stay was peasant and relaxing, even if it was only for one night.

The Fairmont is a very nice hotel, if you need a bit of luxury after long walks around San Francisco, this is the place for you! The staff, facilities, location, rooms are all great. A 5-10min walk in either direction puts you in Union square or Chinatown, and the piers are another 15.  The only 'downside' is that it's up a hill, so be prepared earn your evening relaxation time!

If you are a fairmont member 
If you are a fairmont member and travel fairmont with usual expectations of membership privileges do not expect them here, it is a nice hotel but poorly trained staff in member benefits. The reason a person chooses to stay at a brand name hotel consistently is to receive the benefits provided for loyalty. This does not happen here from turn down service, to gym gear to pressing service, even the one hour advertised pressing service before 530 took almost three hours... As said nice hotel but extra service do not expect .

Interesting
On a whim I decided to spend the night in San Francisco and saw a good deal for the Fairmont. Knowing this was an excellent hotel, I was excited about it. I toured SF and went to my room around 10:30 pm.  
Due to the drink I had at the Tonga Lounge downstairs, which I think had too much sugar in it, I had trouble falling asleep.  What surprised me was that it was very, very noisy. I heard people coming down the hallway yelling to one another, I heard people having sex, and what sounded like revealers returning to their rooms late in the night, not caring about the noise they were making. I was surprised that the rooms were not a bit more soundproof, and it felt more like a Motel 6 experience.
Needless to say, I did not fall asleep until at least 1 am and woke up late and did not get to see as much of the city as I was hoping since I ended up falling to sleep so late. 
Other than that, the staff were very nice, the check-in and check-out process was very smooth.

The reception desk person was super friendly (and fast). This was a 'mini-vacation' because I work in the city -- so I didn't really have to leave the hotel the entire weekend -- The Fairmont provided everything I needed (fun bar/Tonga Room, nice food, great neighborhood). Can't wait to go back!

Historic luxury in the heart of San Francisco
Stayed 3 nights while visiting our son.  We had a beautiful king room with a view-clean, comfortable, lovely.  
Visited the Tonga Room late one night and that was a memorable experience-a band, on a boat, in a pool in the basement of a luxury hotel!  You can't just find that anywhere!

Nice Hotel Central to all the sights
It's hard to choose hotels in big cities that you're not familiar with; you never know what you're going to get. This Holiday Inn is one of the best I've stayed at, with newer facilities, a restaurant, bar, and convenient (albeit pricey) parking. $37 a night to park but that's expected in the big city.

The room was nice with a cool view of San Fran, right in the heart of the Civic Center area. This is pretty centrally located to anywhere you want to go, which was great for my girlfriend and I. The room came with a Keurig coffee (we had a King Bed room) and was very clean. Seemed like it had been renovated recently. Staff was very friendly, check-in was kind of a wait but what can you do? Plus, their vending machines for pop only cost $1.50. When is the last time that happened?

The walls are a bit thin, so if you're offended by late-night/early-morning love-making, maybe get some earplugs or check elsewhere. But it really wasn't bad and we had a really nice stay.

...except maid service coming in at 8:30 AM
Hotel was fine and th reception services were great. However, I left early in the morning to check out views of the Golden Gate Bridge. 

I did not like coming back to find that the cleaning crew was about to enter my room at only 8:30 AM! I think it's ridiculous to start checking in on guests so early in the morning UNLESS it's confirmed that they've checked out. Whether I was inside sleeping or not, it would've been disruptive to me to have the maids checking in on me. I thought that's what reception was for. 

It wasn't a big deal since I was already awake and they didn't actually enter (I arrived at my door right as they knocked), but that's my ONLY complaint.

This is not what anyone expect for Holiday Inn in a downtown of a major city. There's only one chair (desk chair) in the room, no extra chair to sit in, no refrigerator in the room but they renting it for $20/day, does not replenished used up toiletries, there's only one incandescent light fixture in the bathroom by the sink so it's partly dark inside, does not include breakfast for the very expensive daily rate they charged--not really worth the money you pay.

Not impressed at all.
Overall my experience was one that will also be my last. The staff was ok and I think 98% of them that I saw were Asian and older. They only have 1 restaurant in the hotel and frankly it's terrible and overpriced and horrid hours so make sure you bring your own food. They charge for everything and anything including like almost 20 a day for parking and it'snot really that secure and very small spaces. If you have a truck than I wish you the best of luck getting in and out. The positive about this was its close to where I was supposed to be during my trip made my life easier. The sleeping conditions well bed was horrid and the sheets and stuff they put on there even worse. I ended up going out and buying my own to feel comfortable and eventually slept on the floor one night due to how rock hard the bed felt. I definitely felt I didn't receive the holiday Inn experience I normally do when staying at one of their properties.

Arriving early evening the staff were welcoming and patiently dealt with an issue with my credit card's magnetic strip not reading. Staff also gave some great suggestions and advice about getting around and what to see in the short amount of time I had available.

Good choice hotel for visitors to San Francisco.
The hotel is in a great location for daytime activities.  The lobby, bar and games area are very stylish.  The rooms are not bad, if a little dark if you get put on the wrong side of the building.  We were given an option of two rooms as there were four of us including two kids and the first room was light but too small so we opted for the larger room which didn't have much sunlight but as we weren't planning on staying in the room except to sleep we opted for the larger space.
We weren't given any assistance getting all our bags out of the cab which was a bit of a poor first impression but after that the staff were great.  
The location is great for tourists as you are close to transport; subways, trams and buses and right in Market Street which is the main route down to the waterfront and all the attractions down there.
At night the local area it is a bit sketchy as my SF cousins called but really it's fine if you stay aware and don't turn down the wrong street.  Plus my advice would be to use Uber after dark anyway.

I won't say much just that the hotel is beautiful and has clean modern rooms. However, the staff is very incompetent. First, the man who checked us in double charged us for the room and then they "could not" reverse the charge because it has to be done through through creditor... Really ??? Also,  they couldn't provide a receipt that the $ will be credited back to us. Yes, eventually we got our money back BUT it was such a hassle and definitely ruined our stay there!!!

Nice hotel - but starting to look tired. No atmosp
This is my second stay at The Zetta. It is very conveniently located for sight seeing and shopping. I thought the hotel looked a little tired this time, the lobby was empty and lacking in atmosphere (was there any other guests?) and the air con was incredibly aggressive - like an ice box when it wasn't that warm outside. The rooms a nice and large with large bathrooms and lots of amenities. However having no free water and charging $10 for bottles of water in the room was a total rip off - I was shocked that coming in jet lagged and tired I couldn't get any water.

Stylish hotel with easy access to everything 
This hotel was decorated in a quirky, modern style. Really great vibe with a small bar in the lobby, could be kid friendly with a large game room (also great for the kid-at-heart). Don't let that "kid friendly" scare you away though because I only saw 1 child while I was visiting. Rooms were spacious enough, again with the modern decor, I really loved it. We had some issues working the AC but opened a window and that took care of everything. The staff was mostly very friendly, 1 woman seemed to have a bit of an attitude on the 2 occasions I saw her but nothing that would cause me not to return. The location is very close to the BART which is convenient for the airport, and walkable to many bars, restaurants, even the ferry building is a short 1 mile. I didn't mind walking anywhere in the city though because there's almost always a view or something to look at and its very temperate. Overall great experience at Hotel Zetta, would definitely recommend!

Stayed five nights in April. Nice boutique hotel in central location. Comfortable bed, good sized room, full sized toiletries. Good sound proofing. Small, buzzy bar. Didn't have kids with me but seemed kid friendly. Games room. 

First time in SF so it was good to be centrally located close to the BART, cable cars and other transport. Hotel staff, particularly Carolyn and Kristin were awesome. Always smiling and tooK their time to offer great recommendations and couldn't do enough for me. Would definitely recommend.

Boutique hotel
Stayed 1 night. Convenient to shopping in Union Square. Not in the best location. The room was nothing special. Felt claustrophobic with a small window that faced another building. Terrible room location in the hotel. Bathroom was spacious.

Pleasant staff! The 
This hotel is not A Hilton family hotel but the service and the quality of the hotel makes us think is upscale than the hotel that we stayed in our first night(Hampton Inn).Zetta let us pre check in at 10am since we are all tired and frustrated in our first night stay in the other hotel,they also let us park for an hour outside for free while we're waiting for our company.We definitely come back again.

Convenient location 
Like many other reviewers note, this is certainly a noisy hotel with thin walls and not for those who need a quiet atmosphere to sleep. It's an older building that has been renovated but still has some original touches like crown molding and interesting floor plans. Our "deluxe" King room had a sizable walk-in closet which was a nice feature you don't often get in modern hotels.

Hotel is within walking distance to Union Square and Market Street so it's easy to get to public transportation and there are many restaurants and businesses nearby. The neighborhood borders the Tenderloin so it can be sketchy and surprising to those uninitiated to that area of San Francisco. 

Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would happily book again the next time we are in the City.

It is an ok hotel...  not fancy nor the cleanest.  But I stayed there for a week and it was comfortable and close to the center of the city in Union Square area.
It's a dog-friendly hotel... so I woke up from the dog-barking every morning at 7am for the first 3 days.

Old-school but comfortable
Nothing fancy about this 1920s-vintage hotel near Union Square, but it covers the basics well at a price lower than other hotels in the area.  My check-in was somewhat complicated due to my stay being half-work, half-vacation, but the staff was helpful and accommodating.  They were able to let me keep the same room for the duration of my stay despite my split reservation.  Great location close to Market Street, shopping, and public transit.

Very noisy hotel. 
I think this hotel is made from paper as the rooms are incredibly noisy. You can hear conversations in neighbouring rooms and the noise coming from the street kept us awake all night. we checked out after one (sleepless) night and moved to the Marriott at Fishermans Wharf. There are better places to stay at a similar price and hence I cannot recommend this hotel.

Tired hotel that could be a gem - but isn't
Location of this hotel is great but it is sadly in need of a major update.  I actually like the charm and look of the older hotels but do require reasonable facilities and services if I'm paying a high rate.  The hotel is not cheap and I expected a reasonable value for my money but did not get it.  There are signs in the hotel saying there is renovation going on but I could not see anything being done.  Room is spacious enough.  Bathroom is super tiny but OK.  No real place to use as a desk (I'm a business traveler).  Very few channel choices on the TV (even some of the major networks were missing), some lights not working etc.  I try not to be picky about hotels but this one needs help and is off my list.

Terrible hotel, ridiculously small sinks. 
Hotel is extremely run down, rooms were small, bathrooms really uncomfortable. It was really hard to brush your teeth as sinks were tiny and under a weird shelf. You had to bend over to spit the water out. Bizarre. Pretty bad neighborhood out there as well and breakfast was a joke. They served coffee, water, orange juice, hard boiled eggs (no condiments of any kind), yogurts and small pastries. I've never seen breakfast smaller than that.

Disappointed in this hotel.  Not worth the cost.
I chose the Mark Twain because the location is very good, and it had a three star or better rating on some of the Internet travel sites.The evening of our arrival there was no heat in the room.  After talking with the front desk staff and following their instructions, we still had no heat.  They assured me that they would check the boiler room, and we would have heat.  We did not get any that night. I could see that there were some significant renovations and painting going on on the main floor, but was surprised to find it extended to the floor we were on.  Every time we waited for the elevator it was cold and windy due the the windows left open wide to mitigate the smell of the fresh paint around the elevator door and adjacent window.On the day of our departure, the trim around the door to our room was being painted.  That made it difficult to get the luggage and ourselves through the door without coming into contact with the fresh black paint.
I am sure the improvements will be very nice when finished.  However, all things considered, I am surprised that the hotel was accepting guests during the renovations.  As a frequent traveler, I reserved with the Mark Twain in good faith and expected at least a three star experience.

Good central location
The hotel is within easy walking distance of MOMA, Union Square shops, trolley bus connections to Fisherman's Wharf and a variety of good places to eat.  They are currently in the process of adding a bar, restaurant and larger lobby which will make the hotel more appealing.  The complimentary breakfast was adequate but the seating minimal, so not a very comfortable experience.  Would  have no problem recommending this hotel.

Great stay even under construction 
We only needed to stay in the city one night, and I have stayed at the Mark Twain before so we gave it a try again. The room was fine, we had an issue with the radiator, but a quick call to the front desk fixed that. My only complaint would be the continental breakfast didn't start until 6:30 and we had to be gone by 6:15 to head to UCSF.... I saw many people checking early so that was a bummer for them too. 
The water pressure is low, but I'm assuming the construction is fixing that. 
Overall, the room is clean, there's a convince store on the corner, valet parking is available, breakfast is offered and location is central! I would stay again!

Heater did not work but we were able to get a portable right away from the hotel staff. The bathtub and sink were clogged and did not drain well. The room smelled like urine and poo but the bed sheets and towels were clean. The windows are very thin and you can hear EVERYTHING  going on outside on the streets so we were not able to get good, restful sleep. The hotel lobby was under construction. Overall, the hotel was safe and in a good location near great restaurants and shopping.

Noisy water waster
The room was tiny, but the bathroom was large. It was not too clean, the floor hadn't been swept, the sheets and one scrawny blanket were too small for the bed. The air conditioning only worked fitfully. The staff stood outside our room and talked and smoked, so we couldn't open the window. We could hear everything in the room above us. When we returned to the hotel after a day of sightseeing, the bed was made, but the bedspread was jammed on top of the TV cabinet, the staff did not clean out the coffee pot, nor replenish the coffee, cups and stirrer packets. We only got two chintzy towels. The worst thing was that you had to run the water for at least 5 minutes before it got hot. What a waste, especially during a drought! The tub floor was sticky and had hair stuck to it. The " continental breakfast" was packaged pastries and toast. The TV reception was spotty. All together an unpleasant experience, especially for the price!

We chose this hotel because I couldn't stand to pay $300+ to be downtown or by the wharf.  However, after staying here I wonder if it would have been worth the money to stay at the more expensive hotel.  
There is no lobby, no space to move around, no pool, no elevator etc.  We spent 7 days in california on a roadtrip and although this hotel was the most expensive of all of our nights, it had the worst accommodations.

Stayed at to go to the zoo
Checked in and lady who helped us was courteous but not very friendly. We stayed two nights and overall place was dirty and loud. The carpet had a wet spot and a couple of sticky spots on the and by spots I mean areas not small spots. The shower was basic but clean the bed was not very comfortable and the curtains did not eve keep the light out there was a street lamp right outside the our window that basically was shining in the room because the curtains did not seal at all on the sides. The lamps in the room were unplugged when we got there so we could not see as we entered. Did have a fridge which was nice but almost the only nice feature except being really close to the zoo. Don't think I would stay here again at any price.

This hotel is as run down as they come. Clearly the owner just doesn't care. The room smelled, the shower curtain has what looked like blood stains all over it. The walls were paper thin - could hear everything and I mean everything. Anyone could walk up the stairs and hang out outside your door - door opens to outside like a motel. No sense of security. I'm no princess by any means and don't expect super quality - hence booking here. But it was even awful for someone who is low maintenance. I was scared to sleep under the sheets! Do not stay here. Spend extra and stay somewhere where you don't have to worry about randoms outside your door and can sleep comfortably knowing you have clean sheets.  this place was like wing in a horror movie !

We choose Howard Johnson because it had parking, true it's first come first serve, but there was never a problem.
It's not glamorous, but certainly met our needs for this trip.
The best thing about this place was the bed. This king bed was the most comfortable bed my husband and I have ever slept on, we didn't want to wake up in the morning, so we didn't get up until 10:30 everyday.
There are many restaurants within a block or two. We found a Spanish restaurant serving tapa's that was delicious and rated high on Zagat and a Thai restaurant we liked.

Great bed, but....
My expectations for this hotel were not super high, so I was pleasantly surprised that it was NOT a dump.  The building, hotel room and décor are dated, but I found the room neat, orderly, and clean.  The bed was great--perfect combination of softness and firmness.  And the sheets were over-the-top soft.  My two nights of sleep were exceptionally pleasant there.  

The two disappointments were the staff and bathroom linen.  
STAFF:The gentleman that checked me in was nice enough.  It was a late night check in and he processed me very quickly and I was off to my room.  However, the woman at the front desk the next morning appeared to be uninterested in anything going on with the guests.  She appeared to be surfing the web--her eyes were glued to the computer screen, short of when you said something to distract her.  Although she was not mean or curt, she just seemed distracted.  

LINEN:  I'm not picky on the type of linen I get.  I understand how it goes--linen is costly and hotels can only afford so much.  However, my whole stock of wash clothes were like old rags you save to was your care.  All was worn out--just seemed old.  The part that really disappointed was that one of the rags looked so stained, that it really should have been thrown away.  The rest weren't that much better.  My advice to HoJo--invest in new linen.

Otherwise everything was OK.

They offer breakfast, a plus, and it is located in the Hayes Valley, a terrific neighborhood that has everything you need within walking distance.  It is near the opera house, symphony hall, fine and less expensive  restaurants, nice shops, a Walgreen's drug store and a parklet.  Neighborhood feels very safe for walking.

We arrived at the hotel at 1:40pm and were not allowed to check-in. Though definitely all rooms were ready, we were told that we should come at 2pm for check-in.... We spent 20 minutes just outside of their lobby since we did not want to loose the last available parking space. We travel a lot; and it was the first time when a hotel stuff didn't even look at  our reservation to see if our room was ready...

 The breakfast was just ok, though get your coffee somewhere else :-)

Neat but noisy
The Days Inn San Francisco Downtown is not a bad hotel, more of a classic motel-style place, and while it's pretty basic in its arrangement, it's neat, tidy and well-presented.

It can also be very noisy, though, especially late at night, with noise bleeding in from other rooms, from the central car park and from locals who sometimes spill over from the Tenderloin. The neighbourhood itself is very pleasant, but it's only a short walk to a rougher and less safe area of town, so consider where you need to be and what neighbourhoods you need to pass through to and from the hotel. That said, I think the hotel itself is pretty safe. On a different week, you might have a perfectly restful stay, but I was kept up some nights.

Close to symphony, opera
Very convenient location close to civic center, SF opera, symphony. The area is reasonably safe. Price OK.
Rooms are OK. Staff was friendly. the only little disturbing thing is that the lights outside are on all night and shining bright making it hard to get the room dark.
Free parking is available but very limited.

Good for what it is...
I stayed at this hotel in early January 2016 for a week.  First off, the location is fantastic: very walkable to performing arts venues, city hall, museums and there public transit past the door.  There are also a lot of great restaurants nearby.

The room is relatively clean, although I did find stray hairs on the bathroom floor that were not mine, both when I checked in and during my stay, some of which I suspect were from the cleaning staff.  The bathroom had all of the ambiance of a fast food restaurant bathroom.  The TV had some issues (the top two inches of the screen were damaged), but the cable selection was great.  The room came with a fridge and microwave, but the fridge constantly made noise which I was able to tune out, and kept freezing my beverages, but I was eventually able to fix it.

The staff were relatively friendly, and the cleaning staff did not speak much English, although they were nice enough.

The major drawback is that the walls are paper-thin.  There was a couple above me making loud noises until after 2:00 AM on my last night that kept me up, and I could hear people talking at even a conversational level in the other rooms.

If you're on a budget, and want walkability, and don't plan to spend a lot of time in your room, I would recommend it.

Close to Civic Center but..
It is a 60's motel with not much updating. Noisy unless you are on the third or fourth floor. Clean rooms but the AC/heater is old and very noisy. Didn't expect to watch TV but if you want to it will be on an old tube with funky controls and a poor quality picture that goes all fuzzy as various electric circuits cycle on and off. Bottom line: clean and it will do in a pinch, pricing is surprisingly high given the state of the place.

There were some areas of the room that seemed like they had never been dusted, so it made me question the cleanliness. The sink had duct tape around the pipe that was coming off. There were no bugs, so that's a huge plus, and it was just a mile away from where I needed to be...so if I had to, I'd probably stay again.

Conveniently Uncomfortable
We selected the hotel based on it's location to Menlo Park where we were attending a conference. We typically stay in 4-5 star hotels, with boutique hotels being our favorites. We were shocked to find anything three stars or above were well over $400/night. The gentleman who checked us in, muddled through the process, taking quite a long time to process a reservation that had been prepaid. Our room was out-dated and extremely dark. However, unless we wanted a smoking room, no other rooms were available. In all fairness the room was clean and had been freshly painted. However, when we retired for the night we noticed the sheets were stained, thread-bare and very scratchy. We would have switched hotels, but by this time there was little availability and the cost was ridiculous. We had booked for a two night stay. The room had not been serviced, perhaps as it was an extended-stay. I ended up purchasing a set of sheets for us to sleep on. The bed was also hard and uncomfortable. We could hear every sound from the hall way and as we were on the street level, we were unable to open our drapes for more light, as we were located near the front of the hotel and could see everyone entering the hotel.

Save your money and stay somewhere cheaper!
This was the dirtiest hotel I have ever stayed in!  Anything covered in fabric was sticky and filthy, carpet disgusting.   The bed was the worst.  There was a dirty imprint on top of the bedspread in the shape of a large body, and a permanent indentation in the mattress that matched.  It looked like someone had an "extended stay" in our room, come back every evening after work and flopped down in the same spot to watch TV . . . then stayed there for hours.  Had the rest of the room not been so filthy we would have asked for another room, but I don't think it would have made a difference.  I couldn't imagine that other rooms would have been that different.

The corridors and room smelled moldy and musty.  The staff wasn't exactly rude, they just didn't smile or speak.  No one asked us how are stay was when we checked out.  They either didn't care or were afraid of what the answer would be!

That we had to pay $195.00 for this room is unbelievable to me!  I guess its a question of supply and demand in the area.  Save your money and go stay at a local, budget place instead.  Or bring your own cleaning supplies!

Miss lead about where location was. Not being familiar with the area I thought when they posted this hotel in the San Francisco/San Carlos area it would be near South San Francisco where I had to go for my business. Nothing was said about not making bed or changing towels everyday. The breakfast was a pick and go. No protein and not many choices.

Stayed at location based on past experiences with this chain. This was unlike any of the other hotels in the chain. It was nearly impossible to get a hold of an attendant at night and during the day, there was only one poor attendant manning the front desk that was pulling multiple duties. In addition, there was mold in our shower and no spare sheets or extra pillows for a studio room with a fold-out sofa/sleeper.

Very Disappointed/Not What you'd Expect!!
First off, the hotel staff sucked. The night guy Joel was rude and did not do anything about things we asked for or needed. We never received items asked for or additional help from anyone else. Second, the room was not clean and the bathroom shower/tub was disgusting. The stove in the room was not cleaned; you could see food, seasoning, and grease on the stove. The bathroom shower/tub was not clean; it was dirty on the walls/tiles, floor, and around the corners of the tub; very gross. Third, the bed was awful. I could not even sleep comfortably, yet alone at all because any move...and I mean any...the bed would squeak so bad.

Took more than 1/2 hr just waiting for someone to show up at the front desk so we can check in. When given our room we found that the bed wasn't made up, the toilet has been used and was not flushed as if someone had just used the room before we got there. Paid more than what I expected for the room.  Which wasn't really worth it.

A decent hotel convenient to the Larkspur-San Francisco ferry, but profoundly overpriced for the location and quality of the facility.  We made the decision to stay in Larkspur and take the ferry to avoid the outrageous hotels and parking fees in SF proper; however, next time, we will likely stay in SF, pay the additional fees, and (hopefully) have an experience that reflects the money spent.  (The ferry ride was nice but >$40 for two people round trip, so not much cheaper than hotel parking in SF.)

Staying on the Bay, North of the City.
We wanted to go into the City - San Francisco for the 4th of July, but didn't want to drive in or deal with all the other people visiting for the holiday. So we decided to stay in Larkspur and take the ferry over the bay. We found the Courtyard Larkspur. The location was tucked away in the hills on the bay, across the street from where the ferry terminal is located. The Courtyard was very nice with clean comfortable rooms, pool and onsite bistro type restaurant. We had a wonderful time.

The Marriott Fisherman's Wharf was a clean, comfortable hotel. Unfortunately, the price per night does not come with any amenities - you have to pay for wifi and to use the business center. The concierge was also not very friendly and told us to come back and speak with another representative the next day. We also were not able to check in when we arrived because their keycard machine was down. All in all, although the location is good, I would not stay here again.

Very close to the Pier and other touristy things.  Close to Trader Joe's and Safeway grocery stores.  Everything is pretty average, including the service.  Sure, they have fresh cookies out at 4pm for check in - but you will never see them.  They have free umbrella's for when it's raining out, if there are any left.  The food and bar are way over priced and is always empty.  Parking is Valet only and is way more expensive than all the other hotels near by.

Proximity to Union Square is great, if this matters to you.  Room was fine, i.e. nothing wrong.  Didn't feel small or cramped.  Free coffee in mornings in lobby. Just be aware there is no AC - at least not in 11th floor room I was in.  There was a ceiling fan. Since it was cool out, the room wasn't too hot, though I did have the window open all night.  My room wasn't street facing and high enough to escape most street noise.

Charming hotel in the heart of Union Square!
I honestly can't think of one negative thing to say about our stay at this hotel! It was the absolute perfect location, minutes from restaurants, shopping, cable cars, and BART! The staff was friendly and helpful, our room was clean and spacious for being right in Union Square, the beds were super comfy, the bathroom was spacious, and we even had a walk-in closet! I will stay here again every time we visit!

Nice union Square affordable price for San Francis
Nice updated hotel with great character and hospitality. Hotel staff want to make your stay is wonderful,  so be sure to let them know your needs. It's close to restaurants, shopping, activities & transportation options: cable cars, cabs, Muni or BART - Cool boutique hotel.

Hotel in the middle of a nice area
My husband and I stayed at this hotel during our anniversary trip. Our flight arrived at 10 a.m. And they were able to provide us a room right away so we didn't have to wait until the 3 pm check in time. Overall our stay was fine apart from a couple of minor snafus. The most irritating one being that we ordered pizza to stay in one evening and went down to the bar to get drinks to take up. The bartender took our order, gave me my bud light but didn't get my husband his cocktail for 10 minutes. Instead she thought it was more important to take a few dirty cups to the kitchen. We clearly were just wanting to get drinks and go back up but she was rude and told us to sit down and served several others ahead of us. The situation could have been handled much more professional and productive on her end. Not a huge deal but annoying none the less. 
This hotel is located a half block from major shopping like saks fifth avenue, coach, and more high end stores. I loved hearing the man playing the trumpet through the open window at night.

Charming hotel in the center of it all. While the standard queen room was small, it was confortable and cozy. Just steps away from the best luxury shopping...and some bargain shopping if you know where to look.

Right at Union Square
Hotel is RIGHT on S.F.'s cable car line (one of them anyways).  Short walks to higher end shopping.  Many restaurants nearby.  Our room was SMALL...a queen bed and all the necessary furniture.  So this would not have worked for more than 2 people.  Staff is VERY friendly.  Tiny bar...restaurant attached.

This hotel has some character - not your typical 'chain hotel' experience.
Not the fanciest but very nice and comfortable.
Desk and concierge staff extremely pleasant and helpful; overall a more 'personalized' experience than staying at a bigger chain hotel - and reasonably priced.

Nice Staff. Comfy bed, Spacious Room
The time we went to San Fran all the hotels were almost sold out since there was a convention so this was our last option. It was definitely overpriced about 2 times what it normally is. However, the staff was super accommodating since we arrived about 5am and couldn't check in till around 3p, they let us store our bags so we could go out and explore the city. It was really convenient that the hotel included a breakfast buffet since there are no other restaurants around. I thought the buffet had a lot of variety. As for the hotel room it was spacious with two king beds and the beds were really comfy. The air con though was a bit confusing to use since it tends to go to heater when you put it to 70 degrees and has to be 69 or less to be cold. I did like this hotel but I wouldn't choose it again since it isn't close to the city and there isn't much around the area for food options.

Disappointing - bad location - rude staff
room was nice n little clean, (though mattresses n pillows were not much comfortable).
there is a railway track on one side of the hotel and you might hear sounds of trains passing by and not at all safe, other side is little better but again doesn't seem to be much safe.

Staff was also little rough especially the male at the counter. I asked him for a room away from tracks and he just refused and left ignoring the conversation. There was a lady there who understood the concern and offered a room on the front side. There is no restaurant in the hotel.

Airport shuttle is offered every 30 minutes starting 4 AM and takes several stops before dropping you at the airport. keep the change as the guy might ask you upfront for the tips at the time of pickup from hotel.

Quick, pain free check in. Good king beds in room 245. They should leave a couple bottles of water or soft drink on the fridge. USB plugs between the two beds. Great tv, but no channel guide, which requires a bit of surfing. Close to freeway but room reasonably sound proof.  Shuttle to airport also about 10-20 minutes. International is the end of the ride.

Decent place to stay
I stayed here for one night and check in was very easy.  Even though I prepaid via Expedia I had to give up an actual credit card for their deposit and I believe for parking.  Ugh!  I can't stand places that require credit cards. What if I didn't have a credit card??  I know he told me that the deposit would be returned but it was just such an inconvenience.  My room was nice and nothing to complain about.  I slept good and was able to take a warm shower.  There is no swimming pool but a hot tub outside.

Brilliant. We needed a place between flights for a night. Transport by shuttle was regular and easy to find. Rooms clean and tidy. Great friendly staff. Breakfast was more than adequate. Had a meal over the freeway at Pronto's - best Italian and great prices. The hotel stored our bags (we had an evening international flight) and we used the bus service (cheap and easy to use) to visit the Serramonte Shopping Centre. Would use this facility again,

generally good
Stayed for over a week. Great front of house and restaurant/bar staff, but they spent a lot of time daily apologizing for the management decision of not having any ice available without going thru room service. Room service always took multiple calls, from us and the desk staff, to actually bring ice, and even then sometimes we gave up after an hour or so. Also, ice arrives in an open container so that it melts right away. The mini bar is very packed (could be a good thing if you want to buy a lot from there) but leaves no room for any personal use (as diabetics we needed a place to keep insulin which required about 4 cubic inches of space and that meant putting the insulin in odd positions on top of drinks---yes, it was THAT crowded...); forget about using it for your own drinks or food.

Stylish, comfortable hotel in city center
The staff were friendly, the hotel very clean and while the room was small, it was so well designed that the size wasn't an issue. The water pressure in the shower was amazing! Best shower experience possibly ever. 
The bed was super comfortable and the AC kept the room nice and cool. The hotel has a bar with "living portraits" (think Harry Potter). The bar is quite elegant and a place even locals recommend. The food, however, was mediocre so just stay for a drink. There's plenty of great restaurants nearby anyway. 
The bathroom did lack ventilation. I forgot to mention that. But the room was soundproof and so cozy! We would definitely stay here again. Great value.

What a great hotel with lovely staff, Angelica at the front desk and Erica at the concierge were wonderful. Angelica helped me set something up for my girlfriends birthday (bottle of champagne to the room), unfortunately the bottle came two hours late after repeated calls due to the other staff. Can't complain too much at all about that though because they did me a solid. The hotel itself was beautiful, they were very accommodating and its in a great location. I would definitely stay again

Stylish Hotel Experience Near Union Square
Clift is a stylish, contemporary, hotel in a great location. Comparable to the Bryant Park Hotel in Manhattan. Well trained and capable staff. Medium-large, clean guest rooms. Well-performing, free in-room WiFi or direct Ethernet connection. Free premium coffee in the lobby each morning until 10. Lovely breakfast buffet, a tad overpriced. Pleasing menu and cuisine available in the lobby restaurant or for in-room dining. The elegant-yet-hip Redwood Room, featuring outstanding cocktails and service, vibes with youthful, adult energy--especially on Friday and Saturday evenings. Bypass the hotel valet and park at one of the two garages that are just steps away on Taylor Street between Geary and O'Farrell. Both garages offer in-out privileges and valet service 24/7.

Great Location, Great Staff but it ends there...
The Clift truly has a great location and exceptional hotel staff. The hotel lobby does retain a lot of its old world charm and represents today's boutique hotel environment. However, that's where all the good stuff ends. When we first walked into our room, we were greeted by a strange smoky and old musty odor. It inhabited the small hallway between the front door and main living space. We immediately called the front desk and told them. As there were no other rooms available at the time, they offered to clean the carpet as we decided to go out for a stroll around Union Square. When we returned, the smell was replaced by something more pleasant but the odor returned after a few hours. We decided to just avoid that space since we only needed to pass it when entering or exiting the room. A lot of the room fixtures are in disrepair and the bathroom was oddly shaky as well. Cleanliness was not a strongpoint as dirt was visibly accumulated on the door hinges and when I went to rest for the evening and looked at the ceiling, there was a huge clump of dust around one of the ceiling fixture covers. I just prayed that it would not fall on my while I slept.

Mediocre experience 
I checked in and was put in a room far away, down a flight of stairs and at the end of a hallway. The makeup mirror in the bathroom was clearly and visibly cracked and broken. Either some type of weird cleaning agent had been used in the room, or someone had smoked in there, because I had an immediate allergy attack. Then, upon checking out, I mentioned that my experience at the hotel had issues, and -literally - the clerk said, "Umm hmm," and nothing more. For a luxury hotel at the prices they charge, I would have expected much more.

Room was surprisingly large for a metro room, and the staff was friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend if the price isn't a problem, as this was about 4x as much as the hotel we stayed in on our inbound trip, which had a similar location. The rooms were dramatically different in size, and I would say the space was the primary difference all other things aside. Great hotel the Ritz never fails to impress with its consistency.

This hotel was perfect the first time we stayed there- which is why I chose to celebrate my husband's 60th birthday there again as a surprise.  I informed the hotel and they even greeted him with "Happy Birthday" but somehow failed to provide any type of birthday amenity in our room. When I brought this to the front desks attention- she offered to provide breakfast the next morning. He is not a breakfast eater but it was a nice gesture. I have to say this stay was disappointing.

Wonderful!
The air conditioner went out during our stay. There was a delay but the managers did everything to correct the problem! The air conditioner was fixed, the managers delivered a complimentary tray with all types of goodies. They also called to make sure the air conditioner was working and also gave us a free breakfast for my entire family!!! Excellent service! This is my third time staying in California. When I go back I will be staying at the this hotel!

Good location to Fisherman's Wharf
Were not aware that they had a place to purchase sodas, milk, etc to make our stay more convenient.  Would have been nice to know.  Outdoor pool is not helpful in August, evening are too cold to swim.  Bathrooms needed more storage such as shelves for personal belongings or hooks to dry towels, hang a robe, etc.  Our view was of the roof top - that sucked - felt we should get a discount for that.

Over the years I've stayed in this Hyatt Fisherman's Wharf for many times, but my last stay gave me a very bad impression! The bathtub was greasy and clogged, the toilet wasn't clean, the bed sheet had a stain, the sink was clogged too. My wife was very upset about the cleaness of the room and said she rather stay at the Holiday Inn across the street. We agreed not to stay in this hotel again!

This is where you want to be..
I stayed at this hotel for 8 nights, and it was lovely. The staff is incredibly nice, the rooms are immaculate, and most importantly it's location is perfect. You are 2 blocks away from the Wharf. Their restaurant had excellent food, and their concierges were very helpful. The only complaint would be the price of parking, but parking is expensive at all hotels in San Francisco. This is one of the more pricey hotels, but believe me it is worth it. I'm going back to San Francisco, and I will be staying here again.

Do not arrive early
Nice hotel - but we arrived two hours early and had to wait (after a 9 hour trip) - said they would text when room was ready but did not. Also when we got our room - dead on check in time 3pm - it did not have a city view (see pic) - was too tied to complain.

All good but the wifi
This was my second stay at this hotel. The location was great, the room was clean, staff were all very helpful. The wifi signal in our room was not strong enough to allow us to connect our devices. I called the front desk and they offered to send up an technician, I declined. It's just wifi so I can live without it but if I had needed it for work it could have been a bigger deal. I'd stay here again.

Horrible Beds
Everything was good about the hotel but the terrible bed killed the whole experience. I was there for three days and did not sleep the entire time which ruined my trip.  The bed was so sunken in, in the middle, it felt like I was sleeping on a hammock.  It really hurt my back.  There were two beds in my room and they were both exactly the same.  Hyatt PLEASE update your beds!  They must be 30 years old with worn out springs!  :(

Disappointed 
The room we were given was noisy and right next to thepool. This room would be more appropriate for a family than a couple celebrating a fortieth anniversary. Maid service would show up to clean the room after we were trying to rest in the afternoon. We had to keep leaving trying to get them to service our room. The showerhead comes out of the ceiling and gets hair wet. It can't be adjusted because of the height. I expected much more for a Hyatt!

This historic hotel was a pleasant surprise.  I expected the rooms to be tiny, but was pleasantly surprised by the roominess of the entire property.  The front desk was able to accommodate our family with connecting rooms at the last minute.  The high ceilings and ornate lobby even impressed my teenage son.  Bathrooms could use some updating, but that would change the vintage feel.  We would book this hotel again!

I guess is a San Francisco thing, but this hotel is really overpriced for what it is. I got a 2 double bed room as I was traveling with my two kids. The beds are tiny and with the noise (both hallways and outside) I so had a terrible night, didn't get any rest.

Nice hotel, not-so-nice location.
While the Hotel Whitcomb is a lovely hotel, it's location is not so desirable. I felt very leery about venturing out and was glad I wasn't alone. If you are not going to be walking around San Francisco, then I would definitely recommend this hotel. The rooms are small but comfortable and the hotel itself is very old-worldly and quaint.

The staff was great, location was great, the hotel was beautiful BUT the rooms need help! The floors needed vacuumed, (seriously try not to drop anything behind any of the beds or tables!!) the doors were covered with dirty hand prints, and we had no water pressure in our shower. There was hair in the shower, and on the floors!  I can't believe they can charge over $200 per stay!

Claustrophobic room with a dash of small bugs. 
I had a one room with two beds. The room was very claustrophobic. The room had Windows but you could not open them. Was indeed desperate for fresh air. 

In addition, Couldn't use the shower do to a swarm of small bugs living and flying around everywhere in the bathroom. 

For only a one night stay -it was rough. Will I come back. No!

The hotel is nice in that it looks historical. The problem is that San Francisco is a craphole. If you can avoid this city. Avoid it. Tons of homeless, druggies, alcoholics all over the city streets. Not a safe city to visit. Nice hotel and great people if you have to go there.

Not in the safest, nor cleanest area of SF.
We paid a high rate at this hotel. It was completely set at the wrong price point, even though San Francisco is an expensive city. Pay 50 bucks more to stay somewhere nicer that is not in the homeless section of town. Not safe to walk through this area at night. Crack addicts and General homelessness right outside the door at all times. Such a poor representation of San Francisco at first arrival. The hotel staff is wonderful, very accommodating. They did not ask why I wanted to leave upon seeing the elevator or room.  I walked back down to change my reservation. The room itself was pleasant and clean, we stayed one night instead of two . Lots of young "hostel" European types as guests. Graffiti and wall panel missing in one of the elevators, dark and depressing hallways reminiscent of the SHINING. Old hotel that in its day I am sure was fabulous, but those days are gone.

Hated this hotel with a passion.
I was on a 5 week trip and out of all the hotels we stayed at this was by far the worst.
I have nothing good to say about it at all - it's disgusting.
Not worth the rating
No tourist should be encouraged to stay in this part of town, especially families. It was horrific.
The hotel seriously needs upgrading and a rethink of how it advertises itself.
It tarnished the end of our trip and I would never ever go back

stayed here because my friends and I were going to the Outside lands festival at golden gate park. It was a 5 minute walk to the shuttle spot and a lot of the festival goers stayed there. The hotel is small older hotel and had a Starbucks attached to it which was convenient for the mornings. Wpuod recommend for how close it was to the shuttle but wouldn't recommend for a type cal stay in SF. It was bum central at night.

disappointing 
When we first booked the hotel room, it stated that the hotel room is a room with double full queen size beds and room with a view. The view we got was a white building across the street... I did not know that is considered a view nowadays. The room i stayed in was room 562 which was extremely small and the beds were barely full size.  I guess for SF that is considered rather large. The room states that it sleeps up to four people but only provides the room with 2 large white towels in the shower. The next morning when the cleaning crew came they knocked once and did not wait for people in the room to respond before entering. Perhaps that was our fault that we did not put the DO NOT DISTURB at 7AM sign on the door first. But seriously, as a courtesy, please at least wait a few seconds for people to answer before entering. Also, there was construction going on at the hotel so noises starts at 6AM. on the plus side, there is a Starbucks coffee on the first floor but don't expect free coffee for guests.

This hotel is overpriced and underwhelming. There is no lobby or materials about the city, the rooms are small and, unless you manage to get one that faces out, you are literally looking into the window of the room across you. Parking is $50/day and the hotel bar is windowless and dark. The whole experience felt like I was in a tomb for three days. Pay the higher price and get a hotel that has something to offer.

The staff is amazing, kind, knowledgable and overall good people. The room not so great, office chair super dirty as pictured below the vents were super dusty. The only reason I looked was because my allergies were so agitated it had to be something in the room.  I travel with my hypoallergenic dog when we asked for a dog bed it came covered in dog hair. Mind you my dog doesn't shed and she refused to lay on that bed. Lastly No room service only breakfastI guess thats where it counts but was disappointing.

Convenient, cute and moderately comfrotable
The hotel is just one of many that are on this new trend of firmer pillows and mattresses. This is the third hotel I have stayed in the last few months that have had firmer vs softer mattresses in their rooms.

Aside from the bed? The room was well appointed, comfortable and really? The bonus??? Those super plushy and comfy robes in the closet. I miss a good hotel robe and this one had one!! Another little thing I loved was the spa water and coffee service in the lobby. High quality coffee and the New York Times? Count me in!

The maid service was friendly, attentive, and I even got a little note. Would totally stay again.

The hotel was a good place to stay if flying into SFO. The staff was friendly and the room was clean. The only problem we had was they put our room right next to a housekeeping room or the kitchens or something where hotel staff have to make a lot of noise at 5am in the morning. Because the walls are thin, it disturbed our sleep. I wish the hotel would have warned us of this while checking in.

The housekeepers were very good in taking care of our rooms in our entire stay. There is also a free coffee at the lobby throughout the day. I would say that the best is their complimentary breakfast buffet which has a wide variety of choices. Ovearall, we had a very wonderful stay at the hotel and we would come back again.

This place has a great full breakfast.  I have stayed there 2 times now and love the park and fly option so I can leave my car there. The restaurant in front of the hotel has great food and a piano bar.

Close to airport and good hot breakfast
Very easy to find from the airport.  Rooms were very nice - clean - beds comfortable.  Booked a bay view room and was disappointed the view was not all that great, so I would not pay the extra for the bay view. Breakfast was very good had a good selection.  Nice little town square area right over the freeway from the hotel, found a great place to eat Broadway Grill.  Would highly recommend it.

Very comfortable hotel room, the staff were always helpful, courteous, friendly and made us feel welcome every evening when we returned.  There was a newspaper at our door every morning.  When we required some assistance i.e., bathroom lights went off when we accidentally tripped the breaker and service tech was at our room within 5 minutes.  Wonderful service.

Very nice boutique hotel
Hotel is beautiful. Rooms very comfortable and the staff is spectacular. Located half block from union square. 
Had breakfast there everyday a bit expensive but nicely served.
Last night we had dinner in Campton Place and this is one of the best meals we have ever had, Cali-Indian fusion was delicious. 
My family including 2 young kids really liked our stay. Definitely would stay there again. I want to try another Taj hotel somewhere else as well

This hotel had the best customer service that I have ever received and I travel quite a bit. It's in a great location for shopping, dining, and bars. I got a great price that also included a $25 breakfast credit at the hotel restaurant. The only negative is there are no in-room coffee makers but there is free coffee in the bistro from 6am-8am. There's also a Starbucks right next door. Great stay!!

Our 1st Anniversary 
 We were warmly welcomed and it just got better. Harvey and Ruben made our stay so much more enjoyable than we anticipated! Harvey was very accommodating and generous being that it was our 1year anniversary. Ruben, who recommended great places to eat and was extremely kind and hospitable made both my husband and I feel right at home, like family! 
  We loved our Sleep and Soak Room, and sleep and soak we did. The room was cozy, sexy and romantic, perfect for celebrating our first year of marriage! 
 The easy access to trolly carts and buses made our daily adventures in San Francisco a breeze. We didn't take advantage of the night life scene, but if that's your cup of tea Harvey would gladly recommend all the Hotspots! 
 To sum it up we loved our stay at Hotel Union Square!  -(the love birds in room 623)

Awesome Hotel.... Awesome Staff...
I just relocated to San Francisco and spent my first night in the city at The Hotel Union Square. I enjoyed the hotel so much I extended my stay for a week. The hotel offers many superlatives but I was most impressed with "the staff" as they were friendly and went out of their way to assist me with everything from directions to recommending future living accommodations. I would also give high marks to the hotel's free evening wine hour and gym access. Kudos and many thanks to the staff for making my first week and stay in San Francisco a pleasant one!

Left hotwl
I went to the room they assigned me- the room's deadbolt on the door was broken. So I went down to the front desk to let them know and request a different room- they already knew about the broken door lock and was either hoping I didn't notice or didn't care! Upon my frustration and complaining, they switched my room. This second room had dirty sheet and shower. So after this I was so appalled that I just told them to cancel my reservation and I was leaving. I found a Marriott next door and stayed there. This hotel is such a rip off.

Very nice, nothing mind blowing. 
Nothing was terrible, but nothing was incredibly amazing either. The window looked out onto a wall in a tiny area with other walls and windows; can't call it a courtyard because it was too small and can't be accessed. Gave the room a dark claustrophobic feel. 

But otherwise it was adequate, quite nice.

I last visited San Francisco when I was only 11 years old so this was like a first visit. From check-in to check-out, the staff helped us navigate food, activities, and where to go, how to get there, and what to do. They always had a map handy which was extremely helpful. Surprisingly quiet given the proximity to the cable cars which are loud.  We are excited to return.

This is a great location for visiting SF. 
The understaffed front desk make check in and check out a lengthy process.  The room was tiny with a window facing another window approximately a foot away.  I arrived early and walked up to the desk.  "Can I help you?."  When I told her I was here to check in... "Check in is at three pm."  Blank look.  Can I check my bag and come back?  "Over there."  I also called a couple of hours later just to ask if the room was ready.  There was no room ready and he took my number to text me when it was available.  I arrived around 5 pm obviously without a text to check in.  Then I went to the bell clerk to get my bags to take them to a tiny room with a view of the tiny room about a foot away from the window.

The Short Stay in Frisco Before Home
After 2 weeks working in CA for business with a short vacation along the way, I picked Nikko because of its location a block or two from Union Square plus the same level of high caliber comfort I had from another 4-star hotel.  The staff was quite professional and accomidating.  I check in around 11:30 am which is about the same time most people check out.  So I was lucky to have the riom available, didn't necessarily need a high floor, took a rest, then eoamed around downtiwn.   They have a good seafood restaurant with a Japanese theme, had oysters instead of sushi (ate tons of sushi in SF earlier on).  Had to get up super early to catch the flight back home, so the airport shuttle drive in area was easy to manage while I checked out.  I recommend this hotel fir singles and couples alike, along with business travelers and tourists.

The hotel was beautiful. It looks very luxurious! The price was a little high especially when you have to pay extra to park your car there. We were not expecting that when we booked but there is nowhere else to park. It seemed to be located close to fisherman wharf until you start the trek up and down the hills.

I had a really good experience when I arrived, the room that I was given was really good but I left the hotel in the morning and return at night just to find the room wasn't clean, so I called the front desk to complain and they offer to send the housekeeping lady at 10pm. Which I declined cause it was too late. THey have a Starbucks in the hotel, that its full of homeless people, which I dont have a problem with, but they were rude with me. So Its a nice hotel with great location but not worth the money I pay.

The hotel was clean, although the pillows were too soft. The staff was very helpful. The concierge was great with booking our tour.

It was truly a horrible experience....
Ours was a short stay, (Me, wife and two older sons) for three nights. Check in was smooth. We reached the hotel around 7 pm. on 20th July. We were given a room on their 6th floor.
Next day early morning the power went off in the hotel and while electricity to the room was restored by late afternoon, the elevators were non functional for almost two whole days, forcing us to use the stairs for more than  4 times each day. Not what I would expect from a 4 star rated hotel. Overall, poor value for money.

The disappointing: Considering this is four star hotel, we found some of the front desk/lobby staff to be very amateur.  I had to call/ask several times for simple things to be done. They could provide no good suggestions for services/amenities in the area. I would have expected a higher level of service/more experienced staff at a four star hotel.

great location close to Ferry Building
Was only staying in town for the night, and wanted to visit some of my favorite restaurants.  I didn't want to have to spend time or money in an uber, so I wanted to be close to Ferry Building.  Weather was great, and it was great to be able to walk to the places I wanted to go to.

Unbeatable architecture 
I loved my stay here. You cannot beat the classic, almost brutalist architecture. Atriums like this aren't allowed under current building code, so the lobby is a must-see. I could have spent all night there. However, my room had a view of the Bay Bridge and its light show, so it was equally fascinating. The rooms are large, clean  and comfortable  the staff is awesome. Hope I can go back someday.

Short vacation time
The stay was great up until check out. When I received my bill there was a $175 Laundry & Dry cleaning bill that I did't ask for. I was there for only one night and when clearing it up at the front desk, she stayed that she "remembered someone calling to ask for express dry cleaning and to be done by 7pm" when clearly the hotel should know that I was not me who called it and if any one had to pick it up, it was not my room. I had to call my credit card company to make sure that these charges were not valid and put my card on hold for any further transactions. I kept getting charges that were coming through from the hotel for $220.11 and $295.00 when I have already paid at the front desk at the time of checkin. It made the rest of my trip to the Bay inconvenient because my credit card was on hold. I would have gladly gave this hotel a higher rating.

We recently stayed 3 nights here. The room and location were excellent - we were offered an upgrade on arrival and had a room with a balcony and a harbor view. The stop for one of the cable car routes is right outside and the SF Ferry Building is just across the road. Lots of places to eat nearby and a short walk to Union Square, SF MOMA etc. Highly recommended.

We happen to love going to the ferry building so the location was perfect.  We had a bay view and really enjoyed that.  Unfortunately due to the interesting architecture of this 1973 building, the view was not accessible unless you were standing right in front of the window.  While the angled architecture is pretty cool, the building is a bit dated.  The bed was great and had nice linens.

My wife and I spent our 15 year wedding anniversary at the Hyatt Regency in San Francisco and loved everything about the place. We got a room with a balcony and partial bay views that were absolutely stunning. The bar in the lobby was very nice and we met an awesome bartender named Allmanskey. She made everyone at the bar feel welcomed and engaged them in conversation. We would love to visit again soon, but have to save up for that balcony room again.

Extremely dangerous pool area! 
Room was fine.  Pool area uses ceramic tile all around pool and hot tub.  With the water from folks getting out of the pool,  creates a super slippery area. 2 of my kids slipped and fell, and we're brused and sore for a few days. .. with slippers on, and  yes,  they were walking! Another guest fell while I was there,  and a woman that worked there almost fell.  Design is very bad.  Informed the font desk,  and all they could say was,  'yeah, I'll let the people that designed the hotel know. '  Not good enough for me.  This is a hazard to everyone that uses the pool and hot tub. Please replace with less slippery material before someone gets hurt. Thank you.

Nice hotel but they got the reservation for a handicap accessible room wrong and we had to be unpleasant in order to get them to make one available an hours after arrival.  It was adequate, but for $340/day we expected a larger room.  We've stayed in larger handicap rooms at other hotels for half the price.

Wonderful experience!
Great stay!  From our initial experience of arrival and dropping off our car to the valet (a very friendly gentlemen welcomed us and took care of the car quickly), to a pleasant gentlemen at the desk who answered all of our questions & checked us in quickly (we did have reservations for our 3 day stay), to other hotel staff who were all smiles and acknowledged us as we arrived and got our luggage to the elevator.  Beautiful room, great views of the waterfront and arriving and departing flight at SFO.
Surprisingly quiet, giving the proximity to the airport.  Clean, spacious, and well-appointed comfy room.   Our experiences at Hangar Steak for both dinner and breakfast were wonderful.  Expertly prepared steaks (tried the filet.  Best I've EVER eaten). My wife had the free-range chicken with root veggies.  She thought it was AMAZING.  Local produce was used, and it's SO fresh!!   The breakfast buffet was also beyond awesome.   Also, we appreciated having a dog relief station right out back for our service dog, complete with baggies.  All staff members ROCK!  Awesome folks, truly!  Marriot just GETS the concept of hospitality. We'll be staying here again very soon!

Not what you will expect for an Autograph hotel
The location is little off of Union Square. That extra block or two kind of make a difference, and the price does not shows it.
Breakfast is good. Expensive as you might image. The other "restaurant", which clearly is not, may be acounted as a lobby bar. Small.
Parking is waaaaay expensive. 

Rooms are just OK. Big but layout is not roomy. The bathrooms ae kind of small.

I could see some hotels more appealing than this one. Nicer lobbies, closer, with dinner or other food alternatives.

No much to say about it.

Our experience was disappointing, the reception area was nice the room we had though large felt like it was cheaply tarted up with a lick of paint and new carpet. The bathroom was bland and felt like a motel experience. Everyday we had to call down to request coffee or mugs or for our rubbish to be removed. We also had to request the torn bed sheets that we had been given be replaced. Delighted to move out to another hotel.

We called and the luggage took another 45 minutes to be delivered.  The kids were falling asleep while we continued to wait.  When we woke up the next morning, we realized there were only 2 towels for the 4 of us.  Aside from these things, the staff was exceptionally courteous to us and we enjoyed our stay.

Check in was fine.  They had quick, efficient people.  The rugs were filthy and our feet got dirty walking on it.   One of the mattresses was very old and slopped to one side so you felt like you were falling off.  The shower was so weak it was difficult to get the soap off and the bath tub was old, scratched and in need of resurfacing.  In short I would not recommend this hotel.  There are no ice machines so if you want ice you need call them and have it brought to the room.   The paint in our room was old and peeling in spots but you could see it had been repainted several times.

Two complaints:   At a facility of such quality and price, there should be no charge for in-room WIFI and no charge for business center use.  These shortcomings are mostly obviated by the use of a personal iPhone WIFI hotspot and personal tablet, but they're still somewhat unwelcoming.

We stayed in room 1100. This room shares a wall with the elevators. You could hear the elevator going up and down ALL NIGHT LONG!!! When we requested to move, they told us there were no rooms available to move and the staff was not helpful. I understand if there really were no rooms available, but they could have doing something besides saying "Sorry" and leaving it at that. I was expecting more out of a hotel when you pay that much a night to stay there.

Marriott Union Square has set the bar extremely high when it comes to service.

So we arrived a little early but decided to see if we could check in anyway.  I asked the front desk woman if we could check in considering the time and she sarcastically responded with "that's what I'm doing, checking you in." I didn't quite like the attitude but the rest of my stay was great so I quickly forgot about that bad first impression. The hotel was very clean, quiet and centrally located within walking distance of Chinatown and Union Square. There room didn't have a microwave or a refrigerator but those things were minor.

Great location. Very trendy. 
Really enjoyed our stay at Hotel G. We had two rooms - one on the 3rd floor which had a great shower but was a bit smaller and unfortunately the toilet kept getting blocked. The second room was on the 10th floor and was much roomier with a couch. Extremely strong shower over the bath which leaked on the floor. Restaurant downstairs was great. Staff fabulous. Brilliant location for Union Square. Little bit noisy with local bands playing nearby. Best block out blinds I've ever come across! Being picky for this review but overall very happy.

Comfortable, old  hotel adjacent to Union Square
Esthetically pleasing updated older facility in downtown area....our room was spacious, with a good bed and reasonable space for hanging clothing along with two drawers.....they included a Nescafe coffee & expresso maker, which also heated water for tea.....there was a big bathtub, an approximately 45 inch tv, and windows offering some city views .....a/c was there, but we didn't need it

Great location, but loud street concerts 
Once we got our bearings in San Francisco, we really appreciated the central location to many of the great sites. Our only issue was the loud street concerts on Geary St. While they did die down into the night, the music was almost loud just for the sake of being loud. Overall, we were very happy with our choice.

Union Square Hotel - City Central
Small boutique hotel in busy Union Square, the hotel is in an old converted office building.  
The hotel is decorated in line with the age of the building, there were some interesting artworks in our room.  The polished concrete floor made the room seem a bit cold.

The room included a shower over the bath, a small kitchen area with a Nespresso coffee machine and also had room for a table and three stools.

This hotel was great value for the money, central to everywhere, good public transport close by including access to the BART train at Powell Street Station.

The only downside was some street noise during the night and the limited view.

Would stay there again for a short stay.

Handy location for central area
I wanted a place close enough to the main tourist areas that I could walk if I wanted to. So I chose a place near Union Square. On that I achieved my aims with this hotel. 

However it doesn't have much in the way of facilities and feels very dated. The room was very dark and there was some street noise. 

However the staff at the front desk were very helpful and the servicing staff very efficient.

Hotel G - 7/1-7/5/16
Super cool staff. Attentive; they made you feel valued as a guest.
Primo location. 1 block away from union square, 3 blocks from the BART station. For a tourist, this is a great central point for such a walkable city as San Fran. You're a few minutes from a lot of cool stuff, or at least access points. Hotel is right in the middle of the shopper's row, 5-10 minute walk from Chinatown; I could go on about the location.
Amenities were pretty nice. If you're looking for an uber-spacious place, then move on to the Ritz-Carlton. The rooms are cozy and comfortable. The hallways/elevators had a rustic feel to them, which, in my mind, let me know this building has some history behind it. All-wood floors, so if you don't like creaky floors then be advised. All-in-all, the rooms were clean, cozy, and great for an on-the-go tourist. When you needed to come in from your long day of walking & spending money, your room awaits for some TV watching, and winding down. The only "con" I could bring up about this place is that 1/2 elevators was out of service for the last 2 days of the trip, so taking it to the 7th floor took a bit longer than you'd want to hope; even then, it wasn't a big deal for me...take the stairs and problem solved!

Take-aways: Very cool room layouts; workout room small, but effective use of space (chic); clean; comfy beds; in-room fridge; nice sized TV; accessible to everything; super friendly staff

A good-looking and very comfortable hotel. We stayed for three nights and the bed was so comfortable we found it very hard to leave it! Really stylish rooms, super-comfortable towels and bed linen and lovely toiletries. Staff helpful and rooms kept very clean. Dangerously good black-out blinds and sound proofing - we didn't hear the jackhammers on the crossing until we left the hotel! We didn't eat there but there are a couple of great breakfast options (Pinewood Diner across the crossing and David's Diner a couple of blocks west on Geary St). Great location to roam all over.

Everything about this experience was top notch.   Lobby,  room,  everything was beautiful. Yes, it's true the hike up the hill can be challenging but it's worth it the climb.

Nice hotel, great staff, not the best bed
The hotel is beautiful and the staff very helpful and professional. The concierge was awesome! The only down side was the bed and pillows. The mattress wasn't the quality you would expect in a 4 star hotel. They put a cushioned mattress cover (could have been down but I'm not sure) but it slides around as you sleep and starts to come off the mattress. Their pillows are awful... Thin with not much cushion to them.  They need to upgrade to nicer pillows. Also, they charge $7 for a bottle of water. I thought that was kind of ridiculous

Close to the cerntre and transportation 
In general we enjoyed our stay. The staff were freindly enough especially the door men, who were very freindly. The concierge were extremity accommodating and professional. The hotel is at the top of the hill and it's quite an exercise to climb up and down when going to union square area, but then you can always use the cable care, which costs about 7 dollars one way or 21 one day pass multiple trips. They also have weekly passes at a rate of 50 dollers. 
The Asian reception staff could probably could be a litter bit more cheerful and remember that they are working in the hotel business where welcoming people and understanding their needs is esential.

Good location but noisy, mediocre
Once you pay for the room, everything else is an extra charge.  Coffee and pastries in the lobby not only not complimentary but cost twice as much as elsewhere.  Key card system in elevator SUCKS and we took the stairs to avoid it.  Once we agreed to "Green Housekeeping" to not have our sheets changed, we had no housekeeping at all.  Beds never made, no toilet paper, tissues, towels or coffee packets.  We chased maids down in the hall to get toilet paper.   Free Wi-Fi in the lobby only.  Our room was facing an alley with a generator parked in it and we heard traffic from the main road all night long.  No fridge in room.  The location was central to Fisherman's Wharf (one block from waterfront) with Big Bus and Tower Tours right across the street and MUNI bus and streetcar stops very close.  For all that, it was a very busy place with people coming and going all day long.  The lobby was like Grand Central Station.

good location bad experience
We reserved this hotel on Expedia and paid in advance.  We knew we were going to be late check in and called 3 times and asked them to save our room, each time they said it was saved.  We arrived at hotel 9:30pm and they gave our room away.  The front desk clerk was trying to give us a room for 2 people but our reservations was for 4. I told him we reserved a double and he said we reserved "A" room. He was a little rude  It took 45 minutes to find us a room to sleep 4 and get us checked in. When we arrived at the room it wasn't very clean and it was located next to the entrance/valet.  It was very loud.  This room was overpriced for the experience we received, when it could have been much better.  I would not stay at this hotel or a Sheraton again.  They need to learn customer appreciation.

  Opposite street generator, above exit for indoor garage.  Never was told at check in. Did not realize this until we tried to go to sleep. Noise prohibited sleep. On record with guest services at 3:30 am. Finally got to speak to hotel room manager after speaking to someone else he sent out. Offered free breakfast and to change room. Did not want to change room because we were only staying in San Francisco for one day and did not want to waste 2 hours packing, repacking, and unpacking again. Finally agreed to be comped for first night. Manager refused to comp us for second night only to change room. Again did not want to waste the time. Same problem next night, very unfair, hotel was expensive

This is a nice place, close to all the tourist venues at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco. But by the time you pay the outrageous summer price and then pay for any "extra" things like Wi-Fi, coffee, a fridge or microwave in your room, and $60 each night for parking, it really adds up. We could only get a king bed room, so my 17 y.o. had to sleep on the floor (another outrageous fee for a rollaway). Stay a little bit further out and get some comfort.  City busses are pretty easy to use. Fisherman's Wharf is overrun with tourists and tourist-money-grabbing shops and restaurants, and if I went to San Fran again I'd stay elsewhere.

The best thing about this hotel is the location. The bathrooms are too small. There's not much space for anything because there's no counter, it's pretty much just the sink. Our window was right in front of a bus parking space so needless to say, it was very noise. I know the costs in San Francisco are high but for the price I paid for the hotel, I was expecting a little better room.

Great value for being close to San Francisco
By staying outside of San Francisco we ended up saving at least $100-$200 on the cost of a one night stay.  Hotel had plenty of free parking even though they were sold out.  It was very close to a shopping mall in case you were inclined to wander around or needed soemthing.  Several restaurants nearby, including one that was walking distance.  Had easy freeway access and only minutes away from a Costco gas location if you are driving.  Also minutes away from SFO
Paul Mitchell products for amenities. Was surpised by the addtion of individually wrapped makeup remover towelettes to the personal amenities ~ great idea!!  Our room looked out into the courtyard which was very inviting with lots of grassy area and outdoor seating areas.

Park and Fly
After booking the room thru Expedia I called the hotel directly and asked about leaving my car there.  I was told I could leave it up to 2 weeks with no charge but when I got there they told me it was 11.00 per day because I had not booked the park and fly package thru expedia.  They said the shuttle runs to the airport every 30 minutes and we got to the airport easily, but on our return trip we expected again it running every 30 minutes.  When it didn't come we called and they said it would be there in 20 minutes.  After another 30 minutes we called again and were told the shuttle had broke down.  They told us to take a cab and they would reimburse us which they did.  But when we pulled up in the cab and shuttle was in their driveway .

Very nice hotel located within a 10 minute drive to the airport.  Only a 5 minute drive to the rental car return area.  Airport shuttle runs every 20 minutes.

Great location, easy access to freeway
We reserved a room with two queens and got a room with two doubles which was disappointing as we did inquire at check in and were told the room had two queens but it was not a major issue and we were able to deal with that.  The hotel is located close to restaurants and shopping and has easy access to freeways to get to the city.   The room was clean, quiet and pleasant.  The rate was quite good for the holiday weekend, a great value compared to other local hotels.

Excellent choice near SO
The Courtyard in San Bruno is an excellent choice for a stay near SFO airport.  My room was great, with all expected amenities.  The service was superb, no issues at all.  Upon check-in, I arrived a day early due to a change in plans.  the staff accommodated this change with barely a question.  Fortunately, they were not sold out on the weekend I arrived.   The bar / grill inside the hotel is convenient, had all the essentials covered and had very helpful and friendly staff.

Check-in process was seamless. room was clean and bed was comfortable. Hotel front desk comped us with free breakfast to make up for the inconvenience as stated below. Overall stay was pleasant nonetheless.

Disappointed about room readiness (clogged toilet) upon arrival. Service maintenance staff were not immediately available to address the issue in a timely manner. waited 30 min in the room, until the hotel staff decided to move us to another available room.

Mostly positive but some room for improvement
The room was spacious, clean, tidy and comfortable as I would have hoped for from this sort of hotel.

The staff were mostly very helpful and friendly, with just a single occasion where they needed to take the time and listen to what we were actually trying to ask.

The biggest issue I have was with the lack of included Wi-Fi - I think it's terrible for a world class hotel in the middle of San Francisco to not offer this.  It's a small cost for the hotel which would have helped us make the most of our holiday - get with the times!

We checked in, were disgusted with the location and the condition of the common areas, found a hotel in Fisherman's Wharf that could accomodate us for the rest of our vacation, stayed one night, and checked out as fast as we could. This may be a good hotel for a business trip, but not a family vacation.

Enjoyed a New Hotel Experience
Usually we stay at a hotel nearby; however, we needed two rooms for this trip and Hilton beat the price hands down so we decided to try a new hotel. We were pleasantly surprised with the ease of getting to the hotel, leaving our car with valet, and the superb directions to the Academy of Sciences we were given. The hotel staff were all very friendly, quickly saw to all our needs, and the rooms were clean, quiet, and comfortable. The bonus was the hotel was also located near Union Square right where we wanted to be. I would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel. Thank you!

Registration Check-in......
I entered the registration check-in line as number 3 in the queue.  Two clerks working--should be quick.  Next thing I know one registration clerk left---number of guests now about 7 or so.  Clerk didn't return.   Single clerk working had challenges with a check-in.  End of story--took 45 minutes to check-in as third in line.  Others behind me even longer.

Next day---needed info about leaving and reentering parking garage that clerk should have furnished during check-in registration.  Concierge solution--wait in check-in registration line again.  Longer line this time. Deja Vu.

good hotel, location so so, breakfast lacking
hotel staff was awesome, location is great for bars/restaurants/tourism, but the Tenderloin can be a tad "interesting" in the wee hours of the night.  It was a decent stay, but I value near proximity breakfast a lot in a hotel.  The breakfast at the hotel was seriously understaffed, one server taking care of 25+ people doesn't make for a great experience.  The food was fantastic, but coffee refills and water were hard to come by, not b/c the servers were bad, they just didn't have the bandwidth for all the customers.

Convenient, central location
Stayed for four days with my family.  We took Lyft to all areas of the city for about $10 a trip, but it's also on a couple of bus routes.  Lots of shops and cafes within a block.  The hotel is very clean and looks like it was recently renovated (I am a stickler for shower tile grout).  We were on the 7th floor so not bothered by street noise.  At times we could hear people in adjoining rooms, but again not bothersome.  Would definitely stay again.

Really nice hotel in central location
This is a nice centrally located boutique hotel. The hotel is old but with quaint updates. Nice plush bed and modern sink and tub. The decor is old world. 

The front desk staff were friendly and helpful. Gio was a comedian with a dry humour. And the lady who served us breakfast on Saturday was great. Btw, the breakfast was delicious. They had a proper restaurant with the best quesedias with eggs, cheese and avocado. The line up was healthy fresh food. And a bonus! Mr. Holmes Bakery is just around the corner. Get there early because line ups start fast. 

At night, it's not easy to find a good place to eat. But it was cold when the fog rolled in that we didn't venture too far. Or, we ate in China Town and Little Italy that we didn't try any of the restaurants near the hotel.

It's the kind of place where guests may actually chat with each other in the elevators or lounges. Tours, backpackers, locals, all very friendly. We stayed there for a weekend-long wedding at the Lodge, and it couldn't have been more convenient. We also stay there frequently when we come to the city for evening events, because we live a long drive away in the mountains.

Nicely renovated, but the walls remain thin.
We've stayed at the Carlton twice now. I actually didn't mean to book it a second time, but I'd forgotten we had stayed there previously. The staff is super welcoming and the location is good. And if you stay on the top floor with a room towards the back, the room has no street noise. The challenge is the other guests. The hotel is an old property and, although it has had a lovely and needed renovation on the rooms, the walls are thin.

Great San Francisco hotel
Great hotel and experience. Hotel staff was extremely friendly upon arrival and offered us a late check-out. We were travelling with bicycles and they offered a bike lock-up although we chose to store them in our room. Upon arrival there was a complimentary wine social which was great and a very nice start to the evening. The room was clean and nicely decorated, there was a filtered water machine on the next floor which was a unique feature. The only complaint I have is that we were woken up at 5am by the sound (and smell) of the garbage truck outside our window. Overall it was a great stay and we will be back.

Decent Hotel near the action
Nice staff, very friendly and service attentive. Indian style restaurant inside had a great breakfast (pancakes) and there was a cool bar/pizza place next door to hotel which was also great. The room was small for my taste but provided everything I needed. I asked for a frig. and received it promptly. The only issue was the air conditioner/heater which we couldn't  turn on but fortunately we were not really of need of it due to the weather during our stay. Valet will cost you but I think it's worth it. The area is downtown and not particularly clean but it was a short walk to central park area where we commuted by bus to the tourist hot spots.

Convenient for a lay over
Staying at an airport hotel is generally out of "necessity" or convenience, especially in a great town like San Fran.  But I would stay here again.  Of note was the food in the main restaurant.  It was excellent.  They have clearly taken the time to hire a great chef, use great ingredients, and have managed to change the game in the hotel restaurant food business, which is notoriously bad at airport hotels in particular.

Nice Hotel But Not Long Term
This is a nice hotel close to San Francisco airport but it feels like a "get in get out" type of place rather than a "stay for two weeks" experience. The room sizes are quite small and the two "queen" beds are really full sized beds no matter what they say! We stayed one night so it was fine but too small a room for longer term. Our bathtub was blocked so I was wading in ankle deep water while showering but we were on a tight schedule so no time to wait for the engineer to come and fix it or go to another room, not what you'd expect from the Hyatt!

Underwhelming 
I've been looking forward to being able to book in to this hotel for a few years and finally got the chance.

The hotel is ok, but underwhelming to be honest. We had a two bed room in the tower. The beds were small, given the room was for 4 people there was only enough stuff for two setup in the room. 

We were on the 5 floor with a view of a back of a building so had no sunlight. 

Perhaps this was because we got a good deal on the room? Also charge for wifi! Who still does this!?!?

Location was good, I just overall expected higher quality than the other hotels I stayed in SF. I won't be booking again.

Mini Bar checking person is terrible. 
The bed is so comfortable, the location is convenient, but at first day , when we stay at room about 3pm, Mimi bar checking person just open the door, then we say we are in room, so he(or she) left, after we went to dinner, about 8 pm we found our room door just open and unlock. So scary⋯, almost 5 hr our room door just unlocked, It's lucky our room just behind the corner seems nothing lost, but is really make we feel so terrible, no privacy at all(my passport.my computer⋯everything in room)

After we respond, the security person checked⋯， and told us it just the mini bar person come, anyway the manage(Mary) apologize to us and give us a gift to make we feel better, we accept(It's already happen, right?)

Next day morning, 8:15AM somebody knocked the door, it!s the clean person, she stand front another room, said to me she will come back later, and then when I sleep at the comfortable bed, she knocked the door at 9 am again. 

What a day! Why they just work so hard and so early? I don't know, maybe it's just want let me know~everything Is not so easy to just enjoy the joy when other people work so hard.

Lovely Hotel, Perfect Location
We were very pleased staying at The Westin in Union Square. It is centrally located for amazing shopping. We had a lovely room in the old part of the hotel. The only thing I would say is seeing that our room was in the original part of the hotel it was quite small & we could hear everything going on out in the hall. Other than that the hotel was great.

Slow check-in
Check in took more than 35 mins; check out took 25 mins and there were only 3 people in line. There was clearly not enough to staff to handle the influx of check-ins. The environment in the hotel is frenetic and is not a pleasant or relaxing experience. The room was tiny. The staff was the only highlight...they were polite and helpful.

Nice location - easy to get around
Overall this Westin was a nice place to stay - you are right down in Union Sq with many close shops and restaurants. We stayed in the newer tower.  We were supposed to get a higher level room when we checked in but none were available, but the receptionist said she would make sure it's all taken care of the next day.  She said our bags and everything would be moved for us and we didn't have to do a thing. Of course, that did not happen. When we came back from our adventures for the day, nothing was done and they didn't even have it in the system. The new person we talked to took care of it though. Overall, the hotel was convenient and clean. The bed was comfortable but the sheets were scratchy and not at all soft - that would be my biggest complaint.

Breakfast provided which are sumptuous. Free shuttle to and fro the airport. Quiet nearborhood and walking distance to Walgreen, Safeway and Trader Joe. Good transportation by bus to shopping mass with a good selection of food court that you could spent the whole afternoon. Good Bart train from there to Union Square for sightseeing etc. There is a 50% discount for senior for bus transportation.

Mid-level hotel in significant need of upgrading.  Staff was friendly and helpful, and the free shuttle to/from SFO was very useful.  However, room was tiny and cramped and the walls were paper thin.  Had a barking dog in the next room and thank god it went to sleep late at night.  Not the worst hotel experience, but not the best.

We discovered black hairs in our bed around 10 pm  and promptly called the front desk. They said that there was no one on duty that could change the bed for us but offered to deliver sheets to our room  for us to change them. No apology was made by the girl who brought them.  The next morning I told staff at the front desk, and the manager was very apologetic and nice about it. They ended up taking a small amount off of our room charge.

Convenient to Airport
Rather than driving from Sonoma area though the city of San Francisco during rush hour, we opted to drop our rental car and stay near the airport so we could catch our morning flight.  The hotel shuttle was convenient and on time, so we made it through check-in and TSA with time to spare...

The room was clean and had everything we needed:  small fridge, coffee maker, etc.  Self-serve breakfast was also good, except for a couple of kids with parents that had no control...

While we didn't use them, the other hotel amenities (pool, sauna, etc.) looked to be well maintained for guest's use.

All the staff were very friendly. We were able to check in earlier as our room was ready. The hotel is very beautiful. My husband enjoyed going to the gym every morning before we ventured out.  The room and bed were perfect. The room temperature was great. The pillows and comforter were refreshing and soft. Upon my return I went shopping looking for pillows that were similar. I loved having breakfast buffet in the garden court. It had the most amazing items that I have ever seen. A large variety and different items that you don't normally see. There was yogurt parfaits, various cheeses, portuguese sausage, fruit, french toast, pancakes, muffins, scones, croissants, sliced bread, bagels, etc.

We enjoyed our stay at The Palace Hotel with our children very much. A clean, classic, stylish and luxurious hotel; we remarked a few times how comfortable we felt there. We walked to North Beach, Chinatown, The Ferry Building, Exploratorium, SFMOMA, etc. With so much to do in San Francisco, we didn't make it to the pool. We are confirmed "hotel snobs" and this one did not disappoint.

Overall, we would highly recommend this  beautiful property due to the wonderful staff, great location, easy checkin and checkout. indoor pool/jacuzzi and 24 hour room service. The lobby is incredible and the general decor of the rooms is lovely.  However, the rooms could use better lighting and while the beds were comfy, they were small. There were 4 of us in the room (2 adults, 2 children) and we were told 2 double beds were our only option (queen beds would have been perfect). There was also a continuous draft from the large window right beside one of the beds. The pool area is amazing but the temperature of both the room and the pool could have been warmer...a bit chilly in there.  The large jacuzzi is an excellent way to warm up though.

Luxury hotel, lousy accounting and dodgy wifi
The Palace is a really nice, luxury hotel in a convenient location on Market St in San Francisco. Unfortunately our stay was ruined by two poor policy decisions by the hotel management.  On check-in, I made it clear I was using a debit card and was assured that no deductions would be made during "pre-authorization". This was untrue as $100 was immediately deducted and after we spent more than the $100 on a meal, not only was another $100 deducted but also the cost of the meal as well.  We now had over $300 not available on our debit card. We are assured it will be returned - in 5 days.  So my advice - do not use a debit card in this hotel even when you're told it will be OK.  The second is the Free WiFi fine print. The hotel advertises that free wifi is available. They don't tell you that it is NOT available free to Expedia bookings!! Expedia clients get one hour free wifi - only in the lounge, only for one device per room and only once per stay - seriously.  Free wifi is only available to loyalty program members, corporate clients and people who book directly thru the hotel website.  None of this is made clear anywhere until arrival. Free WiFi should be available in all hotels and for this hotel to gouge its Expedia clients in this way is unforgivable.  If you get caught like we did, persist with your request for free wifi and the staff will eventually provide an access code! Also allow an hour to checkout! Apart from these very sour notes, it was a very pleasant stay.

Good: 
1. Location, location, location! Right at the BART Montgomery station, MUNI, nice restaurants, stores and park.
2. Historical hotel with a lot of charm and details. 
3. Live classical piano music in the evenings.
4. Room is relatively spacious for SF downtown.
5. Quiet room, comfortable beds and crisp bedding. If ask for a room on the inner side, not facing the street, it is surprisingly quiet. Since it is a 8 story building, no view (only street view at best) to speak of anyway.
6. We got early check in at 12:30 pm, pleasant surprise.
7. Friendly staff.

Bad:
1. Water pressure in shower is a tad weak.
2. Shower curtain has mildew and tried to cling to my body :(
3. Water temp in the beautiful pool is cold, makes the pool not so enjoyable.

With a fairly well positioned hotel I got to explore parts of California I wouldn't normally go to. I slept in two different rooms and had two different experiences. The first night I slept terribly, as there was a lump in the beg and loud neighbors kept making noises. The second night however redeemed itself and I slept all the way through. It was a nice hotel but I believe I wouldn't pay the same as I did to come back.

The hotel was easy to find with the GPS. The check-in went very well. The staff was very nice and accommodating. Since we prepaid with Expedia, they comped the parking fee because we were only staying the one night. When we got to the room, we were a little disappointed. The sheets were stained on one of the double beds, but it was a small stain in the corner of the flat sheet. There were only two large bath towels and there were three of us staying in the room. The shower curtain was torn and tattered and the toilet had a tank cover sitting on it that was clearly not meant for it. Overall the room itself was clean and cozy. It served it's purpose...gave us a place to lay our heads for the night.

Good priced hotel close to SFO. Very helpful front desk staff (Monica and Patricia especially). Good value compared to expensive nature of downtown San Francisco hotels. Only 20 minute walk to BART station for ride into city.

Airport access was our need
Pleasant facility in close proximity to SFO.  Breakfast hours were early enough, but space allotted was minimal.  Free shuttle to airport every half hour early morning, book it when you check in.  Ours was 10 min late for pickup, but we had allowed for that possibility.  Staff and rooms were perfect for our needs.  We would use them again.

convenient hotel
We found our room and bed very comfortable and close to airport, which is what we wanted.
The staff were congenial but a couple of complaints:  
1.  They failed to give us a wake-up call as requested.
2.  The desk should be more aware of time it takes for courtesy bus to get to airport as courtesy bus took over 1/2 hr to get to airport as we were first stop and then several other stops to pick up passengers.   This makes a difference for planning.  Fortunately we decided to take earlier courtesy bus just in case.

Close to airport. 
Only five minutes from rental car return. That's what we wanted with an early morning departure. Despite being on busy street, room was quiet. Plain vanilla room but clean. A bit of water leaking from toilet tank made for a wet spot on bathroom floor. Several restaurants nearby with a Chilis just a few blocks up the road.

Clean, comfortable, friendly
Clean room. Comfortable bed. Staff was friendly. Close to the airport, which is convenient. Simple little continental breakfast was not great but good enough to start the day. The only negative is that we heard a couple airplanes take off or land around 1am. The hotel can't help that, but I thought that flying times were restricted. It's not a 5-star hotel, but for the price, it is great.

Short and sweet
Just in town for the night wanted a hotel that was close to the airport and not $259.00 a night.  I went for a walk when I got there and had dinner at the Mexican restaurant next door.  The staff was very friendly. The airport shuttle by the way only goes to the terminals.  I needed to be dropped of at a building on airport grounds and he wouldn't do it.  That was disappointing.

Quick Trip
In San Francisco for a very short business trip. Arrived very late, 3:00 AM as a result of flight delays and staff quickly checked me in and room was ready.  Short (very) nap, then business breakfast at the hotel and meal was satisfactory and staff quick with the coffee.

Was able to use a small alcove off the lobby for my second meeting and that was very helpful.  Enough privacy to conduct business and very comfortable.  

Then off to the city for late afternoon meeting and redeye back to NYC.

Bed and linens were good. Furniture and decorations more like a motel. Large window across from bed looked into a hugh expanse of black flat roofing with HVAC equipment. TV was on right side of bed do could only watch tv by lying on your side.

Breakfast food in metal serving dishes was cold and buffet line lacked on demand egg  prep

San Francisco getaway
This hotel was very clean. The beds are comfy and despite many people coming and going , it's very quite. My only complaints are the heavy construction going on around the hotel. Looks like they are expanding the streets and adding to the nearby freeway. Also paying $20 a day for parking is a bummer but I guess that is the norm for the San Fran area, still much cheaper than the rates in the city. Overall it was a great stay I would stay again .

The hotel is close to Airport and most airport hotels are average at best. There was construction outside the hotel on roads and bridges making car travel difficult. The rooms were very old and outdated, not kept up, nor clean. For the price, I would chose one of the many other hotels around airport. I chose this one based on view on their web site. My room was expensive and looked out freeway

Don't leave out any valuables
 The stay was fine until the cleaning staff came into my room to clean and took money off of the dresser that I had left out. I spoke with management, but they really didn't do anything about it.  They said the maid probably thought it was a tip. Tips sre usually given when you check out, not during the middle of your stay when all of your personal belongings are in the room. I felt as though they just blew me off. That will be the last time I ever stay at the Crowne Plaza resort.

Nice hotel, close to the airport and freeway but .
Don't rely on shuttle service if you have an early morning or late night flight.  They'll ask you to take a cab for $20.  Similarly don't expect to park free as a guest, overnight parking is $20!

Given that this hotel bills at a premium over other hotels in the area, it was a major disappointment.  Go elsewhere, save yourself $40.

I want one thing from a business hotel: a place to work.   That means good internet, with fast, WIRED access (as well as wireless).   And a desk.   But mostly fast, reliable internet.

This hotel had the best internet I have ever gotten.   Done.

Otherwise it was a pretty ordinary hotel; basic, but clean.   Café was better than I expected (but also a bit expensive).

Greatet Hotel.  Great Staff
We traveled to San Francisco for a family trip.  Larkspur Landing South San Francisco was a great choice for us to stay at. Located close to the Airport and close to transportation including commuter Train station only 12 minute walk from the hotel.  The commuter "Cal-train" takes you right downtown San Francisco in about 20 minutes.  Making this hotel an economical alternative to potentially expensive downtown San Francisco hotels.  
This is a "suite" hotel giving you a small kitchen area with fridge, stove, sink, dishes, etc.  If you plan to stay in San Francisco for a few to several days, this is a great home base to travel from.  I would highly recommend the Larkspur Landing.

Its close to everything and its not directly in the city which is awesome since i dont care for all the noise, traffic, etc. The breakfast was basic. There is almost no seating in the area where they have the breakfast so most people just took the food up to their rooms. Would definitely stay here again.

Wonderful place. Large, great amenities, comfortable, and the staff was great. It is about 15 out of the city, but it was such a great price for us (we have three young boys and needed a larger space that wasn't going to make us go broke). They have a free shuttle that goes to Union Square on Fri and Sat and free airport shuttles. The area itself is safe but very corporate and boring. Still--a totally wonderful experience.

The rooms were nice - they had been recently renovated.

Had to pay $11 a day to park in their parking lot.

Nice hotel close to the airport
The hotel was pretty nice for the money. The gentleman let us know when we got there we would be staying in one of the newly renovated rooms and to let then know how the experience was. The room was cute, clean and comfy. My only complaint would be the housekeeping staff knocking on doors at 8am waking everyone in the same hallway up.  They also socialized right outside of our room even though we had the do no disturb sign on. They talked for more than a few minutes at a time every few minutes literally outside of our hotel door.

not too far away from many attractions
the hotel was clean and bright. the staff was amazing. I did wish, however, that the shuttle went to other places than just the airport. we used Uber for our transportation, and the prices were reasonable. they did put us in a handicap accessible room, and water got all over the floor during a shower. that is why I rated it a 4. also, after a day, the bathroom started to smell like a sewer, and the maintenance man said he couldn't fix it because how the floor of the shower was. that was disappointing. that's why I rated that a 4. I also wished they would have offered food service throughout the day, not just for breakfast and dinner. I paid $129 per night. not sure if it was worth that.

Middle of road trip
My family of five was in the middle of a road trip through CA.  We stayed at Embassy Suites for three nights.  At first we were disappointed when we realized we were a ways from San Francisco, but then it ended up working out perfect.  The drive into SF and back to the hotel was no big deal.  My kids were so overwhelmed with SF, it felt nice to drive out of the craziness and back to the calm, serene hotel after a full day in the heart of the city!  We were very pleased with every aspect of the hotel.

Totally disappointing
 My family stayed here recently. We had tickets to a Giants game and chose this hotel based on proximity to a Caltrain station. We arrived at 3pm to check in and were told to come back in 45 minutes because our room was not ready. We had to catch the train at 4:19 in order to make it to the game so we had to change and get ready in the lobby restrooms. Since our room was still not ready by 4pm we had to store our luggage back in our car. After the game at around 11pm we were able to get our room. The moment we walked in our sense of smell was assaulted. my 8 year old asked if the scented the room with smelly armpits. I would say it was more of a cross between wet birthplace and damp moldy carpet. That wasn't even the best part. The carpet was actually damp throughout the room!  When we finally settled down to sleep in the mattresses from a 1978 RV, we couldn't sleep because there was a party with bumping music directly below us. When I called the front desk, they said "sorry about that, we could try asking if they can settle down a bit"   I will never stay there again. This is what the low low price of $300 will get you if you stay there (sarcastically said).

Needs a renovation.
Rooms were dark and dated.  Don't sleep on the pullout couch - cheap spring mattress will make you regret it.  While we were there the elevator failed so we had to walk up and down the stairs - tough after a day of romping up and down the streets of San Francisco.  Management kept waking up our kids with their announcements on their PA system to advise everybody when the elevator would be fixed at entirely too late at night (inappropriate and pointless that late).  They didn't charge for parking - easy to see why because they have an obvious bird problem - if you park your vehicle in the lot outside on the west, expect your car to be completely plastered with bird feces daily.

Clean and Comfy
When we visit the Bay Area we always look for hotels outside the city (better rates) and if you don't mind a 10-15 minute drive then this is the place for you. You could find cheaper hotels but this was worth it for us, and the sofa bed? It was GREAT!! My 9 yo and 3 yo took over it and we all slept comfortably. We will definitely go back and book this hotel for future visits. The pictures on the website ARE accurate for once!!!!

Great price, poor room and service
The room did not include a mini-fridge, and most of it appeared as though it was still 1988.  It looks like the hotel had updated some of the other rooms, but not this one.  I needed to use the washer / dryer, and after 5 minutes of searching for it (front desk, maids office, etc) I was finally told by a maintenance employee that the washer / dryer "did not work."  So much for doing laundry after a week on the road...  I had tickets to a concert that needed to be printed out.  My buddy took care of calling the front desk, sending them the email, and walking up there to have it printed out.  The staff person had serious printer trouble (needed new toner cartridge, etc) and after three or four attempts, finally got a clean printout (so bar codes were legible and could be scanned).  Then the staff person told my buddy "maybe next time we not do this for you;" to which my buddy replied "maybe next time we not stay here."  I will say that housekeeping did a good job of cleaning the room each day that we were there, and the location was pretty good for SF.  I would definitely think twice before choosing to stay here again.

I stayed 1 night waiting for a flight from SFO. The airport shuttle is very convenient to and from the airport, only 5 mins or so. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was OK,  while the furnature was on the old side it was clean and the bed was comfy with a new looking matress, clean sheets and pillows. Breakfast wasnt great, the tables needed a wipe, the selection was fairly poor. I just had a yoghurt and ate elsewhere later. Overall given the location and the cost I would stay again.

Run-down. Motel close to San Francisco Internation
Booked a one nite stay through Expedia.  Requested a non-smoking room.  That's what it said on our room door,but when we entered it was so reeking with nicotine and smoke it was sickening.  The rug was stained and filthy.  The room furniture was very old.  The walls needed painting and some paint was peeling off.  When we went to bed the blanket on the bed had been turned sideways to fit across the queen bed.  It only came to the middle of our bodies. It was obviously a double size blanket trying to fit sideways on a queen bed.  No other blanket in the room.  This is a very shabby motel.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  When we asked for a refund of the room fee we were told no because we had booked it through Expedia.

We arrived at the hotel to be greeted by Ed, who was the friendliest receptionist we encountered during stays at eight hotels while on a road trip from Seattle to San Francisco. The hotel, which is just a couple of blocks away from Pier 39, is nice and our room was clean, bright and comfortable. All the staff we had dealings with were pleasant and friendly. I might have awarded it a five if the wifi hadn't been rubbish, though I wouldn't let that put me off staying here again.

Okay hotel, great view
The staff was very nice and accommodating (i forgot my toothbrush at home and they gave me one). Pros: nice location, walking distance to union square and basically everywhere else. Only a 15 minute drive to most places in the city like golden gate park, fishermans wharf, and various food locations, it was also at an affordable price. Cons: the rooms are small but definitely able to room 2 guests, my boyfriend and I didn't have trouble staying in the room. Valet is the main issue here, for a steep price for valet parking, you would expect them to be on their game but it took around 30-40 minutes to wait for our car to be brought up so definitely call at least half an hour ahead instead of the 15-20 minutes they recommend. Our room had a nice view of the city but at the price of being at the 16th floor, meaning a very long elevator ride and at check out it was horrible having to stop at every floor because others had to get on too.

Close to Union Square
The room was very nice. Loved the decor. The one downside was that the room got very stuffy especially after someone took a shower. There was no exhaust vent in the bathroom, and the window was shut and sealed so we couldn't even open it just so slightly to circulate the air. It would have helped out if the window could be opened just one inch to let in some air. Some might think it even a bit claustrophobic.

It would be nice to have more complimentary items other than soap, shampoo and conditioner... e.g. moisturizer, shower cap, ear plugs, small things but a nice touch especially given the location and price of a higher end hotel. Maybe they are available at the desk?? There was really nothing in the room to tell us about the offerings of the hotel or eateries in the area. The staff should also be more informative of the offerings during check-in, e.g. coffee offered during certain time of day. 

The valet service is nice, but the valets seem a bit unorganized. Nice people, just not real organized yet.

I know this establishment has been open for less than a month, so overall it was a nice stay. Hopefully it will only get a little better. 

I would stay again at the price I paid.

Nice hotel close to downtown 
The only complaint I have is how far I had to walk to get to my room at the back of the hotel. The trade off was that it was very quiet. My window looked out into a redwood tree and I felt like I was in the forest. Room rate $195

Dirty bathroom, hair on the bed, poor customer service, broke. Jacuzzi, misleading information and I would not recommend staying there for the money. It's basically an over priced motel 8.

My entire family had food poisoning!!!! 
Horrible experience! We booked a room with two queen beds and we ended up getting a very strange smelly room with one king bed. The staff did not care when I asked why they change our room. They were very laid back, rude and the did not care at all to provide the minimum required service. We orders room service, we left almost all our food since it was horrible. We got all sick that night expect my husband who did not eat. Stay away from this hotel it is horrible. I usually stay at Marriots, but this one only carries the name not the quality associated with the brand. It is not a hotel , it is a nightmare!!!!!

Good restaurant and room service. The menu isn't large but all the food is excellent. After a busy day, nice to relax with an in-room movie and room service dinner. Good parking, though pricey. Sprawling hotel layout takes some acclimation.

Disappointing
The halls were a mess with litter and debris, dirty carpeting.  The dining room was mediocre at best.  It was cafeteria style, not at all comfortable dining, and the food was nothing at all special but priced like a five star.  I booked it on line hoping to treat my family to something special.  The only thing extraordinary were the prices.  
There was a used tampon on the sidewalk by pool.  I reported it to house keeping, it was still there the next day.  Gross.  
Staff seemed tired and not very happy- work as usual.  Overall disappointing experience!!!

My first room the ac did not work. I was miserable the first night. They sent someone up to fix and it seemed like it was a common problem. Then room smelt weird. So I asked to change. Very nice and quickly sent staff up to help me move. The new room was perfect temp. Older rooms but nicely kept. my second room didn't seem as clean as the first however. I picked several items off carpet and even used a wipe to clean desk off. Staff was great but rooms need a redo.

Way Overpriced for the quality
The room was outdated with banged up furniture and holes in the walls where
Things used to hang. Smelled stale and strange odor in the room. You cannot control the air from the room, apparently it's all central air and all you can do is turn on the fan. If you like to leave a bathroom light on for night trips to the bathroom, forget it...all the lights are on timers that auto turn off except the two next to the bed. The bed was comfortable. The night staff was very friendly, Day staff not so much. The rooms are outside entrance. The hotel has three Stories and no elevator, so you have to lug your luggage up and down outdoor stairs if you're  on upper floors. Parking is limited, if the hotel is full you may not find a place to park in their parking lot. I overheard people complaining about that when I was searching for ice. Thin walls, noisy, woke up early to the intense smell of bacon, which I guess would be okay if I wasn't a vegatarian. I will not stay here again. It's a overpriced no frills outdated hotel that charges you for the proximity to the airport. If I hadn't been exhausted from my flight I wouldn't have stayed there.

Location was Great, but....
Negatives:  the first night while I was sleeping the heater kicked on, I can't sleep well in the heat and even though I managed to get it turned off  there was no air-conditioning to counter it's effects.  My ground floor room offered little privacy unless my blackout shades were drawn.  It was often noisy and I didn't feel safe leaving my window open while I slept.

Positives:  The location is awesome!  A beautiful paved bayside trail is steps away - great for walks and plane watching.  Two great restaurants are right next door - Elephant Bar and El Torito.  The hot breakfast served each morning was nice.

Decent place to put your feet up
Very standard hotel with all the minimal amenities provided. Don't expect to be wow. This is a place to go to for a clean room for a night or two near SFO airport. The free breakfast is a huge plus for those that don't want to hassle with looking for food if they have an early morning flight.

The room had clean sheets, floors and bathroom. My biggest complaint was the noisy overhead vent in the bathroom that you CAN NOT turn off. I also had to pull the plug from the in-room refrigerator as it was nearing it's end of life and was making very loud sounds each time the condenser turned on. It was absolutely impossible to sleep with the refrigerator on. The vent was manageable with the bathroom door closed. Lastly, you can hear the planes taking off and landing as the hotel is directly across the lake from SFO air strips. Have caution if you are a light sleeper.

We arrived at the hotel late in the evening.  The staff was very friendly.  First thing I see when I open the door is the furry mold growing on the ceiling tile by the entrance.

Not good at all
The room #208 was doused in some horrible smelling (like a nauseating cheap perfume) scent! There were no alternative rooms available we were told, so open the doors and window (which was already fully open so somebody knew something was wrong!). There was no fan working in the bathroom, so that didn't help. On top of that the place was generally old and grubby.
In the breakfast bar there were only 2 - 20" tables! That's for approx. 200 guests! I know SF is expensive, but this room with taxes cost almost $200 and was truly almost the worst place we've ever stayed. The only place worse was 25 years ago costing $17 and was our only option to sleeping in our car!

The overall hotel seems pretty rundown and does not really look like the photos at all.  The breakfast was better than we expected though.  It is LOUD.

Travel lodge
I expected this to be up to travel lodge standard. It looked nothing like the pictures it showed in the room. It was old, painted gold walls and brown architrave, it was yuk. The employees (night shift) stud outside apartment door talking all night, people upstairs banged around all night so with not much sleep we found that everyone grouped outside our door waiting for breakfast door to be opened at 6.45 in the morning. Be also ready to pay an extra $17 a night to park your car - that should have been put in the price of room. Never had to pay for parking at a travel lodge before! Breakfast was a bowl of cereal or toast and a free for all. Just not good at all.

You get what you paid for
The title says it all. I don't even know where to begin. Checking in was not pleasant what so ever. The young lady at the counter had a "what do you want" type of attitude instead of being approachable. Expedia claimed that the hotel had breakfast but I didn't see anything or was even given the time or place they'd be serving. Took a shower and the water leaked in to the bedroom. One of the beds was so uncomfortable! I could literally feel the springs of the mattress. Lastly what really upset me the most is that at check in I was not told I needed a permit from the hotel to park in their parking lot! Seriously why can't they be courteous and let they're guest know. What if my car didn't get towed or I got a citation of any sort. I will never ever go back.

Also, breakfast should start at 6:00 AM, not 7:00 AM. People are coming to work and need to be at the site by 7:00 AM.

Prostitutes, homeless, and drunks...OH MY! OH NO!!
I spent 4 sleepless nights in this hotel...why?...a drunk customer having a shouting match at 3am, prostitute in a room above me with a squeaky bed and very loud shoes, other prostitutes being very loud talking as they went to their "rooms", a loud bar across the street and a couple of loud homeless people camped out in in the parking lot acting as if it was their living room. I  know now why there were complimentary ear plugs provided in the room. I asked for a disability access room which ended up on the second floor with the elevator being out of service the entire 4 days. The floor had a puddle left from the cleaning bucket...I happened to find it with my dry slippers. The toilet wasn't secured properly and wobbled very precariously. I was afraid after the sun went down...I didn't feel safe leaving the room!

I wrote the parent company Wyndham but got a standard insincere "we're sorry" letter from the hotel manager. Wyndham did nothing! No attempt was made while I was there or via the return insincere email to make me a satisfied customer. I was told that since my booking was made through Expedia, I would have to discuss this with them! TOTALLY disgusted with my experience at Travelodge Central! I don't know how they are still in business! I will NEVER stay there again and will NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone! The star rating should be minus ten!

Avoid
Only saving grace was the proximity to transport links. Otherwise stay away from here. Somewhat sketchy area, very noisy, traffic and people shouting. Open aspect of buildings gives no soundproofing. Yes Travelodges are basic hotels, but I have always found they are clean and cheerful. This was dingy, dark and damp and I can safely say - the worst hotel I have stayed in. Spend a little more and be a little closer to the action. Not that this was particularly cheap, as a final insult.

Disappointed and  Dirty !!!!! Found new hotel 
We were scheduled to stay 2 nights but after checking in and seeing our room .... We couldn't imagine staying there for an hour ! So called Expedia to find us a better hotel which they did !!!! Bad news .. Looks like I can't get a refund from hotel or Expedia . Room was very cluttered and dusty baseboards / furniture . Beds were very small ....  the one bed was right up against the window which  was open with dead bugs on window sill like never wiped off.  The bed spread from 1970 s looks like never washed .. Found someone's hair on it !! Freaked out too because they made a copy of my credit card and license on check in ... I did request copy back when left right away .. Which  manager shredded infront of me . I hope it was the only copy made !!! Just felt odd .. My 15 yr son thought it was odd as well !!!!  Sooooooo VERY DiSAPPOINTED!!! If just looking for cheap place not too far to walk from the Wharf and don't care about cleanliness or clutter then it might work out !!  One positive .. The girl at the front desk was very pleasant and outside of building looks cute !!! Remember old saying ... Looks can be deceiving . Again I went in knowing this was going to be an odd set up with a shared bathroom in hallway facility but I do  EXPECT cleanliness !!!!!!

Authentic Hotel
What an interesting and pleasing hotel. It was like staying at a huge bed and breakfast; other people staying there from all over the world were friendly and chatty. The room was very very small, which is why I said the room comfort was OK, but I guess I could have looked at the room size before booking it (have learned my lesson lol). By 10pm, the hotel was really quiet, and comfortable. You must share bathrooms with others, but every time I went to the bathroom, hardly anyone else was there.

Nice Adult Hostel
My daughter and I had planned a wonderful coastal drive from LA to San Francisco. we found San Remo on Expedia and we loved it!  Quaint and in a quiet neighborhood off the main streets, the hotel is a "throwback" to the early last century - all the furniture and fixtures from another time. As in hostel style, bathrooms are shared, so ask for a room with a sink. Great restaurant downstairs (though pricey) and within walking distance of major tourist stops. No elevator, no television, but that wasn't a problem. Lovely staff.

Perfect location to walk all over town.
Perfect location for walking and much more affordable than at the piers.  Walked to the pier/restaurants - 4 blocks.  Walked to China Town - 12 blocks. Ghirardelli Square - 6 blocks.  Lombard Crooked Street 6 blocks. Spent just 3 days there and had so many wonderful experiences.  Never felt unsafe - there were a few places where homeless slept when we were walking around but they never once accosted us.  Lovely Italian restaurant downstairs, delicious Brazilian crepe restaurant nearby.  Very quiet and we were on the street side of the hotel.  Warm towels, nice shampoo, conditioner, soap, hand sanitizer, combs, mouthwash free for the taking.  Coffee, tea, apple cider, cocoa, licorice, tootsie rolls and mints during the day. Staff recommended good restaurants and short cuts to get there.

A nice time machine...
This was a really cool old fashioned hotel - like what I imagine a 1940's boarding house was like.  But, it's not trying to be quaint - like some of the bed & breakfast I've stayed at.  You just get the sense that their perspective is that this is how it's worked for a century, so if it ain't broke... 

The rooms were very clean, but very small - so, between the room size and the shared bathroom facilities, it may not be great for a long stay.  But for a quick overnight, we loved it.

Nice simple room close to waterfront and cable car
Nice simple throw-back hotel reminiscent of older European hotels with basic rooms and communal showers and toilets on the same floor.  Each toilet and shower is in its own room so its private, not like a locker room. Great location right at the end of Mason Cable Car line. Close to waterfront and Coit Tower. Hotel sits on top of Italian restaurant, but not so noisy that you cant sleep just fine, especially after a day of sightseeing. No TV in my room, but didn't come to watch TV and great wifi lets you stream all you need on your computer or ipad. Atmosphere is turn of the century with antique furniture and art everywhere. Super easy to get to from SFO by BART and Cable Car.

Historical hotel with lots of character
This is my second stay here- and it was just as pleasant as the first time.  The staff are very accommodating, the rooms very quaint with so much character.   The bathrooms/showers are down the hall- but are very private and clean.  There are several located on both floors & you can use any of them.   I am a sound sleeper, but if you are not, there are ear plugs in your room.  You can hear people coming & going, doors opening & closing, showers, maids, people talking; although after about 11pm, it was very quiet.  The morning noise starts at about 7am it seems.  People that demand soundproof rooms- should not stay here; but you are missing out! 

Location, location, location!   Easy to get to many areas from the hotel - Fisherman's Wharf is just a few blocks away.  We enjoyed walking from North Beach to Chinatown- but there are plenty of options for public transportation, if you prefer. 

I went with a friend, and because the rooms were very affordable- we were able to each have our own room.  Some of the rooms have sinks in them, which is a nice addition.  We called the night before & they gave us rooms near each other. They have recently replaced all the beds- and they were very comfortable.

Great location, low price! 
My GF and I were a little leery of the shared bathroom concept, but it was the only place we could afford within walking distance (about 7 minutes) to the pier so we decided to give it a go.  We would absolutely stay there again. The things we didn't love were worth the location and price for us.  We had to lug our huge suitcases up 2 flights of stairs to get to our room, but assistance was offered to us to help.  The room was small, like so tiny we had to open our suitcase on the bed because there wasn't enough floor space, but this was acceptable because we were really only using the room to sleep in.  Our "window" opened to an indoor hallway right next to another guests "window" but at least it gave the impression of more air coming in.  The bathrooms, although shared, were clean and we never had to wait for the toilet or shower.  Softer towels would be nice, but that's really my biggest complaint.  If you're looking for luxury, this isn't your place, but if you want a clean bed to sleep in and a shower you don't mind sharing, the location couldn't be better!  We had Safeway & The Cable Car just around the corner too!  Super convenient!

Nice and Clean but noisy
The Hotel was clean and comfortable and located in the heart of Fisherman's Wharf.  Due to the crowed noise all hours of the day and night you would think that the hotel would invest in some double pane exterior window but no.  If your room is located facing the inner courtyard then won't get a quiet nights sleep.  Other than that it was a good stay.

Nothing in SanFran is inexpensive---including this hotel.  However the pluses are the location, the valet parking, and the ease of transportation from that location i.e. the Muni, cable cars, etc. We didn't want to worry about driving our car in the city, nor did we want to worry about parking it somewhere.

Great location
Just returned from SF, stayed at the Courtyard for 3 nights, 4 days. Very close to Fisherman's wharf, pier 33 for Alcatraz, and close to a main trolley station and buses/tram to different parts of San Francisco. The hotel was nice, stayed on the 4th floor that was quiet and large. Our window faced the parking garage but surprisingly did not interfere with our routine. The staff was friendly and helpful, pointing out places we should avoid late at night and how to get around. Breakfast selection was limited but seriously, there are a ton of places you could go for breakfast and if you're on the run (like for a tour), it's easy to grab and go. Free wifi definitely came in handy, but they have computers and printers which helped to print boarding passes and vouchers. Would stay there again!

Great location and a large clean comfortable room.
Stayed in two rooms for one night in San Francisco.  Rooms were very large and nicely finished, much nicer than some of the other hotels we have stayed at in the area.  Nice front desk staff and a perfect location in the heart of tourist mayhem.   Sound insulation was great and room was very quiet despite being in a heavy traffic area.  Water was literally a couple of blocks away.

Please make sure you double check the location when staying here as there are two Embassy Suites by the Airport and we accidentally went first to the wrong one. 
The overall was a good experience and very convenient to the airport for our return home. The indoor pool did not appear to be heated but the kids swam nonetheless. We also found a pair of someone else's tweezers on the floor in the bedroom when we checked in thanks to my two year old which made me a bit concerned for the cleanliness.  The rooms were otherwise clean and comfortable. We would stay here again.

nice views
We've stayed here before it was renovated because of the location. It is nicely decorated and comfortable EXCEPT the air conditioning system is awful! It was 73.4 degrees after I turned on the a/c and the only reason it cooled down was because we had to open the sliding window to get a cool breeze into the room. We had to sleep with it open all night as we were sweating! Another hotel patron asked my husband in the hotel if our room was too warm, too, and he told her we had to open the sliding window. 
As usual, the happy hour was nice as well as the breakfast. The one thing we were disappointed in was that they are now charging $22 a night to park in their parking lot ($12 if you are a Hilton Honors member) and increased the cost of a night at the hotel. I don't know if it was hiked because of the remodel cost or the NBA Finals beginning; we might reconsider staying there again for that same price.

The front desk personnel were very helpful, too.   
It met the expectations that I have come to have for my stays at Hampton!

Comfort at the end of a long day of travel 
This is a great hotel to come and collapse in after a long day of traveling. If you want an expensive hotel with a fancy restaurant, a 5 star room with an expensive mini-bar & an exquisite view, or a happening bar / hotel to "hang out at" - this isn't it. But if you want a very friendly, helpful staff; clean, comfortable, nice quiet room; and a better than average complimentary breakfast, this is your hotel.

Surprisingly Good Experience
Right from the start, upon check in we were treated with warmth and kindness from the desk clerk, Janmesh. he went WAY out of his way to help us and engage with my whole family. We were there to welcome in my son's twins at Mission hospital. Janmesh inquired each time we came in about the new family. On one day as we were leaving the parking lot Janmesh ran outside to give us a box of See's chocolate to give to our Daughter in law. I have traveled extensively in several countries and I can honestly say that I have never been given this type of positive personal attention. Without Janmesh this would have been an average hotel stay without becoming such a special memory for my whole family. Thank You Janmesh for adding to the the happiness of welcoming twins into our family.

Great value, close to airport.
We had a post-midnight arriving flight from Europe and were grateful for a clean, welcoming room.  Included breakfast was more than basic continental, even included biscuits and gravy as an option, as well as the standard scrambled eggs and make-your-own waffles.  Only down side was that the hotel shuttle stopped pick-ups from the airport at midnight, so we had to take a taxi, which cost about $15.00.  We were so tired at that point that we didn't even care.

Pretty quiet,very convenient to airport
We were only in town for about 17 hours total.  We quite literally went to the motel, cleaned up, slept, got up, showered,and left.  The breakfast claimed to have an omelet station, but it must have been "down" while we were there. We had scrambled eggs (which appeared to be real, not a powdered mix) and sausage....so not horrible, but no omelets like I was hoping for. The bathroom was clean, the bed was comfortable.  The pillows were not great, but I am an admitted pillow snob and have distinct tastes.  These had no depth or structure.  It was like my head was on the mattress even after folding in half.

Convenient location but not recommended for family
The Monarch hotel was located by a community center, so it was no surprise that there were strange figures on the streets outside of the hotel. The location itself was in the middle of the city, close to Union Square, which made up for the sketchy surrounding neighborhood. The hotel itself is fine. The rooms are comfortable and cozy, but very outdated. The elevator of the hotel is best described as vintage.

Good: It's right in the middle of Downtown and close to Market Street. Hotel staff are nice. They can hold your luggage for you after you check out and even book the shuttle to the airport for the fair price.

New sleeping area, old bathroom, forget the wi-fi
The room appeared to be rather recently renovated: the carpet and drapes were clean and attractive. The room was pleasant. The bathroom, however, was in need of repair. The door squeaked horribly (and they couldn't come up with a can of WD-40 on a Saturday), the countertop was separated, the toilet was quite low. That said, the bathroom seemed clean.

The "free wi-fi"  was really bad for someone who checks email regularly and uses the web to find information. I could see -- occasionally -- that I had messages, but I could rarely get the files open to read them. And the couple of times I got that far, I couldn't send the answer. Sometimes my tablet couldn't find the server. The front desk folks said it was due to the hotel's being full.

Decent hotel in heart of San Francisco
The hotel was ok. It was clean but the bed was broken so we were sleeping very uncomfortable. The elevator is very old and makes a terrible rumbling sound and shakes when it stops at the floors. That would have been good to know before we got in it and thought we were going to die. The Valet service is expensive and your vehicle is taken off site. You have to call 30 minutes ahead before you want it even if you are just accessing it to retrieve something. There is a body shop next door that it appears charges less money but seems maybe a little sketchy to leave your car outside unattended in the neighborhood. There was/is construction going on across the street so it was very loud even on the weekend so check into that before you go. The picture showed a fridge but there was not one in the room when we got it.

The Monarch Hotel was a perfect place to stay for me. Central location and price was right. It was clean and served me well for my San Francisco adventure. I hit City Lights Books and the Cannery, all walking. Used Uber for longer distances. The staff were polite and friendly, and helped me save money on my trip. It's not a grand hotel, however, I had a spacious room, king size bed and private bath. Clean, clean, clean. Recommended.

Maybe someone trying to get out of the elevator.  Kids were running all over upstairs.  It was a nightmare and none of us in the three rooms slept the entire night.

Horrible service.
I was unable to utilize my hotel room because a passenger on my flight had to be escorted off by paramedics and it was late arriving at the destination.  I was supposed to arrive around 1 AM which is why I booked the hotel but ended up arriving at 5 AM which was then too late for a hotel stay.  The hotel wouldn't do ANYTHING to help me out with either cancelling or rescheduling for a different night.  The company standards are low enough that when something happens that is 1000% outside of the consumer's control they're unwilling to do anything as a courtesy.  $130 wasted on this hotel and it was completely outside of my control.  I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone simply based on absolutely poor customer service.

Try another hotel
While the hotel cleanliness and staff attitude are decent, I am disappointed that parking and breakfast are not included in the package as with purchases I made with other hotels. Maybe this is how Westin packages their rates, but it's not a happy surprise upon check-in.

Good choice for first time visitors to San Fran
Got dropped off by taxi at hotel around 10:30am expecting to leave bags with bellman until afternoon check in. Instead, desk staff got me in a room right away. Then when I asked for a good place for lunch, he recommended Boudin Bakery. We took his suggestion and had a great crab and corn bread bowl.

Staff were friendly and hotel clean.  Our room had some issues with leaking air conditioner unit as well as a some leaking from the room above ours.  We stayed for 7 nights and had a first floor outside (overlooking the street) room.  Was very loud, it would have been nice to have given us an interior room given we were there for so long.

Family vacation in San Francisco
The Pier 2620 hotel is an excellent family hotel down at Fisherman's Wharf.  We stayed for 5 nights and thought the location was great...just a couple of blocks away from the madness of the wharf, yet much quieter in terms of foot traffic. Our room (3rd floor) had a nice view of the hills around the city though the auto traffic was sometimes a bit too noisy. Amenities were ok...no pool, free wi-fi, free coffee and water (2 small bottles).  Everything in SF is expensive during summer so be prepared to pay $350 per night after taxes.  Recommend that you take advantage of close proximity to North Beach and walk up the small incline to enjoy meals there at a lower cost than offered at the touristy wharf.

I feel I was deceived, we paid over 800$ to stay there and they didn't include breakfast that blows my mind. Also 150$ for parking, it was our 20 year honeymoon we went through 6 states over 3k miles and stayed in 4 hotels their prices we from 150$ a night to 88$ a night all free parking and free breakfast. I fell lied to and disappointed with their hotel.

We definitely enjoyed our stay at Pier 2620. We arrived early and were able to check in early. The hotel is only a few blocks from the Wharf and MUNI transportation. Our morning flight out was cancelled and they pushed our check out time for two hours at no charge, then stored our bags while we toured around waiting for our new flight. Everyone was super friendly and the room was impeccably!!! If I ever visit SF again, I will certainly stay at Pier 2620!!!

Super location for a reasonable price
We loved the location - close to Fisherman's Wharf and Ghirardelli Square.  Easy access to public transportation.  Staff were very helpful and friendly.  The room was very comfortable - cool, heavy, wharf-style decor so different from average.  There was a huge TV.  We had a courtyard room so it was very quiet.  Probably the only drawback was that the sliding bathroom door didn't really close completely.  We did not eat at the restaurant but there were plenty of good breakfast cafes nearby.

Great hotel. Fishermans Wharf is only 15 min drive. The front desk lady Terry was so helpfull and very nice to us. The waitress at the restaurant on tge other hand wasn't so nice. She was rude and it looked like she didn't wanted to be there. The breakfast food was great but the service needs improvement. The rooms were clean, the elevator has a feature that only guest can use it. Is very safe. Overall the hotel is great exept for the service at the restaurant. I will give it a 9 out of 10. I will go back to that hotel exept I will go eat somewhere else.

A hotel with so much potential
This could be a great hotel. 
A good location, great price and decor is pleasing, and yet, the staff are unresponsive to complaints, the only lift is the slowest in the world (and have to share it with staff which stop at every floor) and the free WIFI is so slow at some points during the day its not worth using (if you offer it free as a benefit it needs to work at all times). 
I highlighted that the shower didn't work properly twice over the week. I got a note that the maintenance person had come and fixed the toilet! I reported this, the poor wifi and the maintenance note, it was apparently escalated to the manager, I then reported to the staff again two days later and never heard anything else.

Good Location, Noisy rooms
The hotel was in a good location 2-3 blocks from union square and it's flat so that's a plus for San Fran! A bit closer to the rougher part of SF that I was trying to avoid (tenderloin) as a single traveler but didn't have any problems other then some friendly conversations with a homeless man. I was given some information on arrival about transportation which was great though chose to walk most places as I like to get my bearings.The hotel was under some renovations at the time but everything was as advertised online i.e. the vertigo theme. My room was always cleaned to a high standard and the bathroom was in great condition. Only thing about the bathroom is it took me a while to figure out how to change the water flow from the bath tap to the shower tap. The room was spacious and the bed was super comfy. The only major downfalls where the slow elevator and the noise from other guests, I was in a corner room and when the people next door shut their door or even hopped into bed it sounded like it was in my own room and I even got scared at one point that someone was trying to open my door but it was just the people next door. Anyone walking down the hallway you could also hear very clearly.

Great concept and theme, outdated facilities
I recently stayed at this hotel for business purposes and thought it looked like a great hotel for the price. I have mixed reviews of the hotel. Overall, while it was a cute hotel, I definitely will not be staying here again. I wasn’t able to sleep while I was there, between the uncomfortable bed, loud cleaning staff in the hallways and the fact that I didn’t feel safe. In my opinion you’d be better off spending a few extra bucks to stay somewhere else.

If you are traveling for business – note that there is not a business center. They have a computer that is in the lobby so there is no privacy whatsoever. There is only one very rickety elevator that takes a lot of time. Some furniture and fixtures seemed outdated and some had visible wear and tear. The fitness center is under construction so I wasn’t able to use it. I didn’t know about this ahead of time so I was disappointed. The hotel cleaning staff was SO TERRIBLY LOUD in the morning that they woke me up daily. Not a lot of noise insulation. Bed was very uncomfortable.  Front desk staff was hit or miss – there was one gentleman who was okay, but the rest were not friendly or helpful. I arrived before regular check-in time, by 2 hours. I was told to come back, which almost never happens to me when I’m traveling for business. Obviously they have a right to do this, but it was the way they handled it that was not very pleasant, especially after a long flight.

Good value, nice hotel, borderline neighborhood
If you need to stay near Union Square and you need to pay less than the sky-high rates at some of the bigger hotels, this is a good option. The staff were friendly, the room was nice enough. There were some renovations going on but it didn't interfere with my stay. This was my second stay at Hotel Vertigo. I had a conference rate at a bigger hotel but they couldn't accomodate me for the first night of my stay, so I knew I needed another hotel for one night and I immediately thought of Hotel Vertigo.

The hotel is kind of on the edge between the Union Square neighborhood and the Tenderloin. It's not a really great area, but the hotel feels much nicer than its surroundings. 

I'm sure I'll stay there again.

Fantastic staff, great location!!!!
We stayed for two days at Hotel Vertigo and will stay here again in the future. The location is beyond great, just a 4 block walk to the trolley cars and plenty of buses to get you where you want to go. Parking is 49.00 per day at the hotel, we parked one block east of the hotel on Sutter and only paid $50.00 for two nights. The staff is the main reason we would go back. I asked the gentleman at the desk I think his name was Edward what sites we should see while in town. He provided us a detailed map of the area and pointed out what sites we could see on foot and what places we needed transportation. VERY HELPFUL, this guy should get a raise. My wife and I talked about him last night. Most employees don't go out of their way to help the way he did. This is a major reason we would go back, customer service, this place has it. No pool or Jacuzzi but that's ok. Plenty of places to eat in the area and my wife and I felt safe walking at night in he area. Great job Vertigo!!!!!!!

Checked in and had requested a room with two beds.  Not only did the girl at the front desk have difficulty speaking and understanding English, she was very rude, and refused to help me with my request.  They say the rooms have been renovated, but really they have just been painted and replaced carpet with fake wood flooring.  There are zero amenities, no hangars to hang clothes on, no soap,or shampoo offered in the bathroom, I'm actually surprised they had toilet paper. Overall very uncomfortable, and unpleasant stay.

The Manager Art was extremely rude and kept bragging that he was a cop for 15 years. Grounds and pool were disgusting. Rooms were minimal, even for a Motel 6, one wash cloth for two guests.

The Motel 6 is in terrible condition. 
Filthy exterior inclunding buildings, grounds, pool. Manager, Art was extremely rude. Desk staff had inefficient equipment, the key machine did not work; told us to use a.Post-It note instead of giving us a "Do Not Disturb" hanger. Undesirables were walking around, very uncomfortable for Motel guests.

Location was ok, close to freeway
The owner refused to give senior discount, refused to honor reservation for 2, then charged for extra person. Even when I was forced to stay a second night, he again would not give a senior discount and again charged for an extra person, even though my original reservation called for two beds, which were provided with original reservation. He kept saying, "you can only have one person but you get two beds. Any more people, you pay extra. And no senior discount, even though you are a senior citizen."
When I came in the lobby in the morning for coffee, he jumped in front of me, pushing me out of the way so he could get his coffee first.
The rooms were dirty, I wore white socks and the soles of the socks were filthy in five minutes. The night stand was sticky and the bathroom was no better. The housecleaner's carts don't carry wet mops, so I don't blame the housecleaners. They aren't given enough time to properly clean the rooms. I left a generous tip because I feel sorry for them, working for that owner.
I will never stay there again.

The motel was comfy but not well equipped at all. We stayed in two rooms with kitchenettes but there was very little kitchen equipment and in one of the rooms the fridge was broken. You also have to pay for wifi at $2.99 for 24 hours per device.

This place sucks 
1.  No bathtub plug so forget bathing.
2.  No luggage carts so enjoy hauling.
3.  No dinner nearby so enjoy starving.
4.  Elevator vibrates room so forget sleeping.
5.  Nearby parking scarce so enjoy walking.
6.  Complaint to management regarding (1) and (4) received following response: "we're the cheapest hotel in the Bay Area so we don't care."  
7.  If you care, stay elsewhere.

Our view was great of the marina.
We had a great time.  Our T.V. didn't work real well.  But the staff tried to fix it and they couldn't get it to work either.  It kept pixeling out and you couldn't see the picture.  The maids came around a little early for our liking.  The continental breakfast was really nice.  The staff kept it stocked and clean until the very end.  We would definitely stay there again if we are in the area.

Guest service was very nice! Checking in and checking out was easy. They have a shuttle service that we took to bars down the road. Our driver, Tim was so great! The whole hotel was very clean and the continental breakfast was okay. The cottage cheese and peaches were excellence. Some advice for the continental breakfast: Hard boiled eggs need to be cooked more (they weren't ready), there needs to be milk, and  need Pam spray for the waffle maker needs PAM spray. Overall, I'll be back! It was wonderful!

Nice, quaint hotel on the bay.
coming from out of state, I was worried about finding the hotel.  Our GPS directions lead us right to the hotel.  The staff were friendly.  The elevator made noises that scared my teenagers.  Breakfast was nice.  It was too chilly the 2 days we were at the hotel, so we didn't get to use the pool.  There are 2 restaurants right next to hotel within walking distance.  The hotel provided a cookie and milk snack in late afternoon/evening, which was a nice touch.  When I needed to go to Walmart, they printed directions off for us.  It is truly the little things that make a difference!  If we ever return to the bay area, definitely will stay here again!

We chose this hotel as a more economical place than central SF and were very pleased with it.  With hotel shuttle service to the BART station, it was easier to get around than it would have been from many more central hotels.   The room was comfortable, nice light breakfast with good choice and a good heated outdoor pool.

Great place to stay when exploring Bay Area
Comfortable hotel with very friendly and helpful staff. Free amenities (parking, wifi, bikes, breakfast, cookies, fridge, microwave) - no nickel and diming you. Our room had a balcony overlooking the marina. Great walking/biking trail along the bay.  Location was perfect for daily excursions by car or BART to San Francisco, Tiburon and Angel Island, Muir Woods and Stinson Beach, Berkeley, Palo Alto, Monterey. Oakland airport very close, but SFO also nearby.  San Leandro was friendly and also had good grocery stores and restaurants. East Bay traffic was manageable, especially using HOV lane.

Nice Hotel close to the Airport
Easy to find, clean room and facilities. The only thing I didn't like was that I had to ask for a breakfast coupon. When I booked the room, breakfast was included but when we checked in I didn't get a coupon. I wasn't aware that to get a free breakfast you have to provide a coupon and the next morning had to deal with explaining the waiter that breakfast was included when we booked, he said he will take care of it but still included it on our room charge. At the end the charge was removed but I don't believe I have to deal with this. The person who checked us in the night before had to explain the process and provide the coupon. Other then that everything else was perfect!

San Fran Burlingame Hilton Garden Inn.
Hotel shuttle bus did not even stop at the covered waiting stop area at the airport. We had to call the hotel on the courtesy phonr and then we had to wait another 30 mins for the driver to get all the way back to the to airport. We made tge mistake of waiting at the wrong covered bus stop area and when we saw the shuttle pass our station and slow down at the best one. But apparently, when the driver didn't see anyone directly under the bus stop, he didn't bother to even come to a full stop. He then just took off to other next terminal. Not happy with shuttle service the hotel provided but hotel staff was very pleasant and accomodating.

Got there at 11pm, found NO PARKING! 
We arrived late, yes I understand. However I expected to at least arrive park, check in and head to bed. They suggested we park behind the building. Which was dark and seemed unsafe. My husband made his own parking spot as did others who probably has the same problem. In the morning after we got some rest my daughter wanted to watch TV as we got ready to head back to the pier. The TV didn't work! Had to have the maintenance man come fix it. Mind you I am trying to get ready and this interrupts my routine makes us late. He was quite nice though. The room over all was nicer than I expected. We literally just slept there so we weren't looking to pay an arm and a leg so I was worried about how clean it was going to be. I have heard the saying, you get what you pay for and this had me a little nervous since we didn't pay so much considering what others were charging. 

If you are looking for a reasonable place to rest your head. This is actually a decent place. It was clean and comfortable enough for the price. It's about 30 minutes from the pier so it wasn't too far off, yet far enough that you don't pay so much for a place to sleep while in San Francisco.

One man's nightmare!
My friends and I had arranged our trip to San Fransisco several weeks in advance. It was my job to arrange for the hotel and car. I have used Expedia on several occasions to book or reserve the things needed for my trips. I'm satisfied with Expedia but not with this Hotel at all. Although we were greeted in  a professional manner we soon learned of the problems with our rooms. The trim paneling for the door was missing on one side, a light bulb was burnt out and the room was dusty as soon by a large amount of dust which had accumulated around the vents. My friend who is elderly and disabled found very quickly that the main door lock to his room was malfunctioning. Upon calling the front desk they came up and had to toggle both the inner and outer handles to get the door to close. They didn't fix the problem only blamed it on a malfunction and showed my friend how to proceed from there on out. At 3:33 am the fire alarm went off due to a broken hot water line. We got no sleep so it didn't make for a very good day! Lastly we had a cookie ice cream which was taken by the front desk and put into there refrigerator for us to pick up but when we returned the next day it was gone!

Nice hotel close to the airport. Parking was easy.
Had a good 5D/4N stay in this hotel. Although the room given to us was fronting the highway and can hear the train passing through, the staff explained to us that it was part of the Expedia deal we got. No option of getting a free update which we expect some US hotels would give if the higher end rooms are not occupied. The breakfast set was okay, served hot each day, our children loved the waffles and we liked the bacon and eggs and potato Mexican style with salsa. 
Price is ok for an average 3-4star hotel. Will consider Marriott's hotels in the future.

Close to airport
I was greeted professionally and felt well cared for. However, i did not like the room that we were assigned but accepted it because i was too tired to complain when we arrived so late at night. The room was fairly clean but i realized the next morning we were next to a train track that scared me first thing the following morning...i will recommend asking for a room on the opposite side facing the water!

Must Love Planes, Trains and........ 
The hotel is nice, comfortable & clean and the staff are friendly and helpful (though not completely informed of their own deal with Expedia). The only problem with this hotel is its proximity to the airport and Bart line. Although I was aware of this at the time of booking, I was a little surprised at the level of late night noise from the airport. Seemed like we were right at the end of the runway or maybe they change the flight path at night to avoid other more densely populated areas. I don't know, but it seemed that as soon as the Bart line (which literally runs alongside the hotel) ends its run for the day, the planes start theirs. They do have double paned windows but they don't seem to make much difference. However, being as I live along side the 405 fwy in Los Angeles, the noise was totally tolerable to me but it might not be for others

Clean/Quiet hotel close to the airport
We only stayed one night before flying back home.  The hotel was quiet considering that it's close to the airport.  It's cleaned and comfortable.  Restaurants were only 5 minutes a way.  That was very convenient.  We would stay there again.

Nice hotel, away from the city commotion
Stayed here for two nights. Was better than I expected. I anticipated getting a room with a view to the lake but those were all booked. The girl at check in was very nice and put us in a room away from the train tracks to compensate and we got a partial lake view which was still very nice. It was quiet and calm away from the city noise but a close 7 min drive into downtown. The beds were not the softest but still we were able to get a goodnight sleep. We loved the continental breakfast, great variety of food and convenient. I would stay here again.

Great staff, small rooms, worth the stay!
The location of the hotel is perfect and central to everything you need to get to as a tourist!  We walked just about everywhere we needed to be.  The hotel staff were very kind and accommodating. We parked just a block behind the hotel, however when we went to pick up our vehicle on the last day there were an enormous amount of people waiting there for rentals and pickups.  One of the hotel deskmen had walked up to the garage, saw us standing there after checking out and offered to hold our bags for us until we could pick up our vehicle later that day (which was the plan anyways).   I found that one small gesture from the hotel staff to be so wonderfully kind and considerate of our time.  The hotel was clean and well kept, the bathrooms are insanely small and the shower is a bit hard to maneuver in due to the tight space but nonetheless it was clean and served it's purpose.  We were able to enjoy the 5pm wine tasting which was a great way to unwind.  The TV sets in the rooms are a little outdated - while they are flat screens there were no place for a USB plug.  Also, there was only one outlet to use to charge our phone and it was on the other side of the room under the desk.  All in all the minor inconveniences were grossly insignificant to the quality of our stay and I would stay at this hotel again. Mainly due to the very nice staff!

Nice hotel with good, central location
This was my first stay at Executive Hotel Vintage Court and I'd say it was a good one. The amenities are a bit old but they definitely serve their purposes well (everything works and they are comfortable). The location is pretty good but it is in the middle of a hill, especially if you are using public transport to reach there.

The lobby was exceptionally nice and cozy and if you are a person who likes to work in open public spaces you'd love to work at the lobby which also has a real fireplace. The shower was very nice and without any water pressure issues (some hotels have this issue and they say it is to preserve water).

WiFi was okay but a bit unreliable. I've had better WiFi in San Francisco.

Overall, I'd stay here again but there are definitely equivalent alternatives around the same price point, especially if you don't mind the room size.

Fine for a 3 star property, close to Union Square
Stayed 2 nights in an Executive Room with a Queen bed.  The bad:  The A/C in-window unit was terribly loud, but fortunately, didn't have to use it very long.  Opening a window was actually quieter, despite the street noise.  No in-room coffee maker or coffee in the lobby.  One slow elevator. I just took the stairs after one use, since I was on a low floor.  The good: price relative to other hotels with similar proximity and quality is pretty good.  I don't plan on making this my go-to hotel, but it's a fine option when rates everywhere are high. The bathroom was more updated/renovated relative to the room. Good choice of wall tile on the accent wall.

Staff bent over backwards trying to get Super Shuttle to return my luggage their rude and dirty driver drove away with. Friday thru Tuesday (my departure was Wednesday) Super Shuttle was of no help. Finally Tuesday the located my luggage but had no way to get it to me. I used BART and went to their "office", Bus Yard, to get my bag. The Executive Hotel Vintage Court staff performed amazingly in trying to help.

We booked the hotel for 2 nights. The 1st night, the room smelled musty & AC was loud. So the next morning we requested to switch rooms, which they gladly accomodated. The room was much nicer, a little bigger than the previous room, AC was quiet, and the bathroom had a tub. Appreciate all the help from the staff.

Cozy hotel with good services 
This hotel is really good! The location is excellent. It is a block from Chinatown, about 5 blocks from Market Street and there is cable car stop down the block. The staff are also incredibly nice! I requested to change rooms (I was unlucky and my room had a bad view) and they were quick to do so. While I was out they moved my bags into another room for no additional cost. The hotel also provide shuttle service to the airport for about $15 a person. This ride saved my life! And best of all, there's free wine (good wine too)! The downside is that this hotel isn't the best for those with children. The atmosphere is more adult-like and there is no pool.

Nice Hotel - Good Location - Small Room
Stayed here for 3 nights in May 2016. The room was nice, we asked for a view but were advised to stay at the back of the hotel to avoid street noise so our view was a brick wall. The room was small and the he bathroom was even smaller with not much space to open a big suitcase (we had 2 big suitcases). 
The location was good, one block from street car and about 3 blocks to Union Square. Fishermans wharf is $10 taxi ride.

Great Location in Union Square right in the heart
The hotel stay was an absolute joy. The staff was very helpful at all times and the rooms were always clean tidy. A little small and crammed bathroom but then again this is Francisco where space is premium. The Restaurant in the hotel was very good and so was the little cafe with some of the best croissants this side of the Atlantic.The only suggestion would be is to have more staff available on the front desk during peak hours and allow Uber/Lyft drivers to pull up to the front door.

Good location, pleasant, not amazing. 
Overpriced for what it is, I guess that's just San Fran. We had an interior facing room which just looked at other room's shutters. That was a bummer, but it was very very quiet, especially for being right in the middle of the hustle and bustle. The coffee maker in the room was very odd, it was in a drawer that couldn't pull out all the way because the cord was plugged in right through the drawer. It made it not really possible to use. They delivered a hot water kettle for tea but we still couldn't make coffee. They gave my husband coffee each morning in the lobby, but it would have been nice to make it in the room in the afternoon or evening. 
Molly at the front desk, Daniel at the concierge desk and Christine through email and text were all very helpful and friendly. They made our stay go from below average to above average, with late checkout and nice attitudes.

My husband and I stayed at this hotel for four days and loved it!  So clean and well kept, amazing staff that goes above and beyond for you, nice modern clean rooms, very comfortable bed, etc.  It was our anniversary so the manager sent up champagne and chocolate cake for us the first night, which was a really nice surprise.  Everyone was so friendly, willing to help with anything, we would definitely stay here again!  And as a bonus, it was the perfect location, right in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the downtown life. Highly recommend!!

Older hotel, ok.  Would not be back 
This Hotel is an older hotel and has been nicely updated, as you would expect the rooms are small, and the bath’s even smaller.  That said the big disappointments for us were the house keeping, one day only bath towels no hand or wash cloths, and a shower that backed  up around your ankles.  

While the restaurant staff at Kuletos was extremely attentive, the kitchen is not what it used to be.  We ate there twice, the Seafood Cobb Salad came pretty much with out andy dressing, minestrone soup was very average.   Ordered the Seafood pasta for dinner, sent it back - shrimp way over done, no seasoning, muscles questionable - sent it back.   With out the great staff this restraint would be closed.

Heart of Union Square 
The hotel is located in the heart of Union Square, San Francisco's main shopping area. The hotel is conveniently located minutes away from the Bay Area Rapid Transit (Powell street station), which is a 30 minutes train ride to/from the airport. The hotel has a restaurant and café, but Starbucks and many other restaurants are right next door. My room was very quiet as requested. It was spacious and clean. I really liked the snacks and drinks in the fridge. Check-in was quick. However, the staff could be warmer with guests.  Also, the cleaning lady knocked at my door early in the morning and kept coming every half hour so that was annoying. The next day I put the "quiet please" tag in front of my door before going to sleep and no one bothered me. When I left the room I turned the tag, which read "service please" (if I remember correctly).

Charming Hotel with a nice remodel.
We did enjoy ourselves during our recent stay.  Located in the middle of the Union Square area with lots of restaurants and the trolley car right outside of the hotel.  We were there with our kids, who are teenagers.  Our room was large enough for 4 people to fit.  The bed was comfortable, the bathroom had a pocket door separating the sink from the shower area, which came in handy.  It did work out well for us.  My criticism would be that the building has a smell.  It's like old wood mixed with food.  That probably sounds stupid but it was a very strong smell. So strong that I was worried about my clothes smelling when we left.  They did not, by the way.  It was fine, but The staff should probably consider opening windows on the upper floor or investing in some air fresheners.  Also, if you need something, the front desk does not answer the phone.  You need to go downstairs and speak directly to them.  It was not a big deal at all since we were always coming and going so we just spoke to them as we passed by, when we were in need of information or extra blankets.  Also, grab water bottles from a surrounding store. Bottles for purchase in the room were too expensive.  I would stay here again, regardless of the smell.

It's a little hard to find and the signs that say "Do Not Enter" on both sides of the block lead you to believe you can't turn onto that part of the street...however, you can.  The locals know that but obviously visitors don't so no matter what the sign says, you can in fact turn on to that street for the purpose of checking in and unloading your car.  We were able to check in early at 11:00 which was very nice.  The hotel decor is really cute and even though the room is small, it is very clean and cozy.

Villa Florence is a little gem of a hotel right mack in the middle of downtown SF. Everything is only steps away: restaurants, shopping, and transportation to all points of interest.

Disorganized check-in, housekeeping, & small room
After checking in we were given keys to a room that was clearly still occupied by another hotel guest. I believe the poor woman was still using her bathroom when we keyed into the room. Upon returning to the front desk, the mix up was treated very casually and the next room we were given was very small, with barely enough room for the queen bed to face the door and with no counter space in the bathroom. We were woken the next morning at 8am by housekeeping; we had planned on leaving the room around 10 so had not posted the Do Not Disturb sign because we didn't expect them to stop by so early in an occupied room. We came back in the late afternoon to find that housekeeping had left a bottle of cleaning spray out on the table. It just seemed as if the attention to detail at the Villa Florence was not what we would have expected for the price we were paying.

Not a hotel, not a house
The concept of the Hyatt House may be home away from home for extended business stays or families who want to bunk together, but it's more like a high-priced hostel. There's a lobby community space with couches and a flat screen, a dining hall that functions as an impromptu drinking spot at night, vending machines that sell instant food, cords, and other sundries (condoms?...nah, too family oriented), a couple hang-out rooms disguised as meeting rooms when you have to video conference, but don't want to from your room, and a breakfast buffet where cereal is the highlight. Then there's the typical business hotel spaces: a room with a PC and printer, a fitness center with a couple machines, and a pool. Everything here is DIY: guests taxi their own bags with luggage carts, do thier own laundry in the coin-operated machines or the bathtub, and make their own meals using the in-room kitchen stocked with pots, dishes, tableware, dish soap, etc. This place is compatible for the independent type who doesn't want a hotel to dictate how they stay, or how much they spend on overpriced hotel meals, but don't expect high-end or luxury for the high prices.  Not quite a hotel, a house, or a hostel, but trying to be everything simultaneously.

It was very noisy from the train going past all through the day and night we did ask to swap rooms as we had travelled from England and needed sleep and this wasn't possible with the train noise but there was no rooms left, there wasn't any warning that if you payed for a bay room that this would be quiter before our stay as they are located in a different position, but general cleaning and maintenance of the hotel was very clean and close to where you needed to be with a shopping centre on the doorstep for your convienience.

Nice hotel close to all the action
Was really happy with the hotel's location, cleanliness and staff. It is located at Bush and Powell so within walking distance to Union Square and all the shops, Market St and all the shops and Chinatown. There is cable car access right outside the hotel that can get you right to the Wharf. There are numerous restaurants and bars all within walking distance and it is close to a car rental if you need that for a trip. Nothing negative to say here.

Orchard Hotel is perfect all around.
We recently stayed at the Orchard Hotel for 2 nights in mid July.  It was very expensive for our Canadian dollar exchange, and normally I would not think the price was worth it...I was wrong.  The service at the hotel was exceptional - front desk valet, and concierge were above and beyond.  Very helpful from simple direction requests to recommendations for best places to eat off the beaten path, ideas for not to miss things to see as well as places to avoid for safety reasons.  

I highly recommend the Orchard Hotel and hope to be back.  Thank you to Darnell...he was truly awesome.  :)

Cable car went straight past the corner of the hotel so access to the piers was easy and being so close to union square was great for shopping and dinning.

Convenient to all of San Fran
Nice, clean hotel with an excellent, helpful, very friendly staff. Hotel is located conveniently to all things to do in San Fran (I.e., not far from Fishermans Wharf, Pier 39, Ghiradelli Chocolate, Chinatown, etc). This is not a hotel to exercise at though as their workout room is a vacant hotel room with an elliptical & a treadmill. Also, there was only one ice machine working in the hotel & it was located on the 6th floor. My wife & I did discover Uncle Vito's Pizzaria, located about 200 feet from the hotel, & we ate there 4 times during our six day stay! Everything was delicious, especially the pizza, burgers, & sautéed mushrooms!! Their prices are reasonable too for this high priced city. Highly recommend

Central location, safe, comfortable, good amenity
The Orchard hotel is handy to everything.  The cable car is just outside the door,  Union Square is a short walk down the hill, the trolly cars are also within walking distance. The car rental depot was just across the road as well so I was very happy with the location. There are lots of good cafes and restaurants very close by for breakfast and dinner. We didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on their restaurant also it did look inviting.
The amenities were very good and the staff were friendly and helpful.
The only slight negative was the humming of the elevator in our room even though we weren't right next to it. The noise didn't keep us awake or bother us, it was just a sound that you noticed.

The hotel is located close to the Union Squire and 5 mins. walk distance to Powell St. station on Market St.  You can catch the cable cars on Powell St., take Muni street cars and buses on Market St, and take Muni Metro and Bart from the Powell. St. station.
The room of the Orchard Hotel was so clean that I stayed there veeerry comfortably. 
The clean staff who was in charge of the room, left his/her name card on the desk each day. 
I am certain I will stay at this hotel again.

While the hotel has a good location some aspects of the hotel need to be addressed. The lobby was okay, but the overall condition was disappointing. The service elevators were unreliable and very slow. The breakfast / dining area was in very poor condition and not very well serviced. The quality and standard of the food was below average.

Hotel photos in Expedia are very misleading.  In their photos rooms appear much larger, with balconies that overlook a pool, with well appointed furniture and big windows with drapes.  None was true of the room I was given. The establishment is a motor lodge rather than a hotel.  Rooms are accessed from outside rather than from inside the building.  The room was very dark because of the very small window with no drapes.  The fixture overhead was very dim.  My room was n the fifth floor.  The elevator only went to the 4 th floor.  I had to drag my luggage up a narrow flight of stairs around the back of the building to the fifth floor.  There was no alarm clock and had very thin walls with no sound proofing.  I could hear the couple next door engaging in coitus.  There were black hairs n the shower.  I humored the next morning when an employee was carefully monitoring the guests for the very cheap breakfast of only carb and no protein options.  I have never been so misled by a hotel description n Expedia.  Expedia was not successful in getting the motor lodge to refund the two nights I did not use.  I will be disputing the charges with the credit card company.

Confusing layout and not convenient for guests
I didn't expect a fabulous experience but I did expect a better then Motel 6 experience for the price. The layout of the hotel rooms and floors is atrocious. There is no easy way to get down to the lobby from your room - all room entrances are from the outside and its a maze to get to your car or to the lobby. They also didn't have a basic amenity such as a toothbrush for guests that happen to forget one. For the rate of pay I would have expected at least that.I have to give them kudos for the crisp apple at the complimentary breakfast though.

Hotel was in good location, clean, and staff was very good.  However, I would say the rating of 3.5 was high.  I would put it in the 2.5 range, compared to other hotels I have stayed in with a 3-star rating.

Many tourist locations could be reached in walks of 30 minutes or less, and daily parking rates were more reasonable than other hotels I looked at.

Based on the cost/value, I found it reasonable and would stay in this facility again if travelling to San Francisco for personal travel.

Great view, clean room, AMAZING STAFF! 
After reading reviews on 30 different hotels in my price range (under 160 a night) without any luck, I finally found this gem. Experience from beginning to end was flawless. Available parking as soon as we pulled up which in SF is not easy to find... Walk in the lobby doors and immediately was greeted by the most WONDERFUL employee I've EVER encountered at any business (I'm not exaggerating by saying this). Stacy made my friend and I feel like we were coming home to visit mom who hadn't seen us in a year. She explained everything to us so throughly and we felt like we could ask her 100 questions without her being bothered by us. Her energy was so refreshing and it was great to have our first interaction with someone a postive one after being on the road for 5 hours. I could seriously write a book about how much I adored this woman. Just know, this hotel is clean, smells good, no bugs, no dirty sheets, comfy beds, big shower, beautiful view of the Golden Gate Bridge, very nice pool area, great working a/c in the room, and QUIET at night! the free breakfast was basically all breads (muffins, bagels, literally sliced bread, croissants, waffle mix to make your own waffle, cinnamon buns without the sauce) a bucket of apples and not ripe bananas, small cereal bar with regular milk, orange and apple juice, and coffee. not a great selection but it's free so whatever. Honestly, the hotel was perfect. don't understand why it doesn't have a higher rating. ALSO, FREE WIFI!!!!

My husband and I were very pleased with the hotel's location as it was in a great location - close to shops, restaurants, the piers, and public transportation.  It was very clean and comfortable and the staff (particularly the front desk) were very friendly.  We also really appreciated the breakfast that was included which was much more than we were expecting (pancakes, eggs, sausage, cereal, oatmeal, bagels, toast, cinnamon rolls, juice, coffee, yogurt and fruit).  Since San Francisco is so spendy, it was nice to not have to pay for at least one of our meals each day.  We were only disappointed by 2 things: 1) our view (which was a building with windows only a few yards away) and 2) no pool (Of course, it was my fault for not noticing on the website that there was no pool).  Other than that - we had a great stay and would definitely stay here again.

Decent hotel, overpriced for what it is
Sofitel San Francisco Bay thinks it is a posh city hotel, but it's really just an average hotel trying to look fancy. None of the staff was particularly friendly or went out of their way to help. We were four to a room, and were given only two sets of towels. When I called down to the front desk, they fixed it, but acted annoyed about it. The pillows are so mushy, your head sinks to the bed. And the restaurant is extremely expensive, although the food is very good. That said, everything was very clean. Just nothing particularly great to make you rave about the hotel. Compared to our stay at the Doubletree in Berkeley, this wasn't great.

Decent. First stay, booked room for 3, they had a roll away bed set up.. Only 2 towels in the room for 3 guests. Second stay, booked same room for 3 guests. No roll away bed set up. Had to call to request one and was told I was going to be charged $20 when I reserved the same room as the first stay for 3 guests. They did not end up charging me. Still only 2 towels for 3 guests. Breakfast of any form is not included which I find highly unacceptable. You are paying a large amount to stay here so breakfast should be included especially if you are a calling yourself a luxury hotel. Parking should also be included. You pay for a room, you should get all of the comforts and amenities to support your stay there. The pool was VERY dirty.

I've stayed at other Sofitel hotels, and always found them to be very nice. This one was s bit of a disappointment. The location is basically a corporate park with nothing nearby. The very small pool was just ok, no hot tub. The bar/lounge area lookednice but we got out and had a lovely dinner in south San Francisco.

Also, the tub/shower had nicks that weren't repaired, but being on the dog floor, I didn't mind.

Nice hotel, great staff, good location
Reception staff always friendly and very helpful.

Location on the lake is great for getting out to complete my morning exercise and also made a nice walk to the office and back with the colleagues I had over for a workshop.

Restaurant small and friendly with good food, never felt crowded. Good service in the bar area. Rooms a nice size and comfortable.

excellent.  The only pity is the food  in the restaurant is too "expensive" given the amount and quality of it, i.e., value does not match the amount of money paid for the food.

Hotel service
This hotel is over rated. 
The price is too high for very low rated service! Hotel parking fee is $65 per night 
If you add all these fees together, then prepare to pay over $400 per day for minimum service you get
No consideration for pre booked guest from Expedia .

A funky, interesting hotel in a great location.
I stayed here for 4 days for work. Used to corporate chain hotels, it was nice to stay in a boutique hotel with a little more personality for a change. The room was small, but well appointed, which is what matters most to me. It was an easy, pleasant walk to my company's office in the Financial District, and I felt perfectly safe as a woman walking back and forth. It was nice to walk up Grant street on my way there and ogle the window displays of the high-end stores, and there are a number of restaurants around (though to be honest, I just ordered delivery to my room most nights, which was also a super easy process thanks to the text concierge services). My only small gripe is that the hotel is split above the 4th floor, and it can be a bit confusing to figure out how to get to rooms on and above the 5th floor the first time, so you might want to get a bellhop to show you up the first time if they tell you you'll need to take two elevators to get to your room!

Fantastic unique hotel in a great location just off Union Square, centralised in the heart of San Fran. Staff were very helpful , rooms were spotless and had all the necessary essentials.

Bar area just off reception is a cool area to chill and/or get some work done if needed.

Free wifi, no hassle with having to pay, passwords, etc.

All in all, a really good stay here and would certainly recommend it!

Great Location; Cool Vibe
We liked that the hotel was new, fresh, clean and in a great location.  Great local restaurants were right at your fingertips.  Breakfast at Farm Table and Honey Honey were awesome and walking distance. Union Square is close and I mean close, as well as, the cable cars.  We used the MUNI most of the time and did not use an automobile; you don't need one.  They have these really cool red bikes to use FREE anytime available.  Our room was small but functional and we were not in the room that much. Again, it's new and well thought out....I would not think twice about staying or referring this hotel to our friends.   BEWARE:  Parking is EXPENSIVE; really overpriced I might add. Get your numbers before you use their parking privileges.

High end price...low end room. 
Hotel location was perfect for our needs.  Close to the theater area was essential.  The room they gave us was small and ok.  View was great but the windows were nasty dirty so it made for an unpleasant experience.  Room was for handicap person which was fine in general but the bathroom shower had no lip and it flooded with ease on multiple occasions.  Decor was generally clean, but dated.  I swear the leather/vinyl table type stand was direct from the 70's... The rips and gouges would attest to that.  Overall the staff were nice, just wasn't impressed with the room, especially when it was $350 a night.

Parking cost $65 if u want to park in the hotel, otherwise, you can park down the street, one block away for $35.  Check in was fast, they help you with your bags.  Hotel has 36 floors!  Super awesome view, of embarcadero/industrial/or union square.  Rooms are small, but ur in the city, what can u expect.  Elevators are speedy.  Their work out room has updated machines and weights.  The staff is superior to any other hotel.  Super clean and spotless, no doubt!  Location was awesome, walking distance to Chinatown/little Italy/shopping mall or designer stores/cable train site.  We had to drive to embacadero, so we saved that trip for after checking out.  AWESOME Hotel, using it again when I go back to sf!

Nice hotel in a quiet area
This was my first visit to SF and I really enjoyed the area the Kimpton is located in.  It is right by Japantown and Lower Pacific Heights.  There is plenty to see and different types of restaurants all in walking distance.  All the other main tourist areas are a short drive away.

I only had a couple complaints.  The beds, while very comfortable were a bit noisy, I think due to the base the mattresses were on.  Also, I was never able to have consistent water temps for the shower, I'm not sure if this is due to the age of the building or what.  

Those things aside, I would definitely stay here again.  The area is very quiet and relaxing.

Nice hotel just outside of Japantown. 
Cool looking and comfortable hotel with a very friendly staff! The beds were comfortable and the room was good sized. The hotel is right at the corner of Japantown and the Fillmore district. Unfortunately, most of what we did as tourists was about a 2 mile walk away. Although I didn't mind, the walk was challenging for my 6 year old. However, the location probably helped with keeping the cost down. All in all, we really enjoyed our stay!

Had a lovely stay at the Kimpton Buchanan. We stayed in a room with two queen beds and there was loads of space. Good coffee machine and lovely toiletries. One of the best things is the hotel's happy hour. It's great for meeting the other guests. My only gripe was the view. We booked a city view (room412) and ended up looking at a supermarket roof. If you were really dexterous you could perhaps see a bit more, but certainly not what I thought I was paying for. Kimpton, this room does NOT have a city view! Otherwise great.

The hotel was great! The staff was very friendly and check in was quick. The room was very clean and spacious. The bed was the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in at a hotel, it was very soft. The hotel is directly across the street from Japantown, which was very convenient.

Staff were better that many hotels, room was quiet and clean, beds comfortable, in-hotel restaurant food was very good (decor mediocre). The rooms are small, with not extra much room, and not enough surface space in room or bathroom. We're stayed at the nearby Kabuki which has the same star rating, and it was definitely a cut above in terms of decor and space. Overall, I'd still recommend the KB as a very acceptable place to stay.

Staff was very nice, really liked the complimentary wine reception every night.  Our room was right down the hall from the in-hotel restaurant, so the noise was a bit annoying sometimes when we were in the room after dinner and until the restaurant closed (mainly during the weekend).  The location was great - we could walk 2 blocks over and be on Fillmore Street, which had lots of cute shops, restaurants, and a Walgreens.  Pretty close to everything else as well (we took short Uber rides to Golden Gate Park, Pier 39, Palace of Fine Arts, etc.).  Comfy but sort of noisy bed (the frame/support), and the top to the nightstand was wobbly.  There was a long hair stuck to the bathroom wall when we arrived though - weird.  Would stay again though!

Very Nice Business Hotel in Convenient Location
This was a much nicer hotel than the ones I normally stay at, but this is San Francisco and it's super convenient if you have business in Japantown, which I did.  The room had nice furnishings and the bed was comfortable and temperature controls were easy to operate and responsive.  They offered free wine in the early evening hours and there is a restaurant located on the corner of the hotel.  I did not look for nor find out if there were extra services available such as an exercise room or laundry services.  I needed to have my boarding pass printed out and the front desk gladly did that for me as well as arrange a shuttle ride back to the airport.  I loved all the Japanese restaurants and shops nearby in the Japan Center.

We spent 3 days in the city. Great visit. Anywhere you stay in San Francisco is expensive. I didn't love to pay 26.00 a night for parking but grateful it was a secure place. The hotel looks older from the outside, but the rooms were great. Very soft beds and pillows. Beautiful view from the 10th floor. Only a couple complaints. Very low water pressure for showers and flushing toilets. Poor bathroom lighting. There were 11 floors. We were on #10. But it sounded like we were sleeping on the street. So much noise from outside. They need to upgrade the windows  to eliminate the outside noise. Besides those things, nice hotel. We'd stay again.

good location but insufficient parking
The Inn itself was fine-within walking distance of Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39, etc. It was very quiet- our room was right next to the elevator and we never heard a thing, morning or night. Our room had a nice view of the Golden Gate Bridge. The staff was helpful with extra blankets the first night and with directions how to get around by foot or by transit system. Biggest complaint would be that they do not have enough parking for the number of rooms in the hotel. We got parking easily when we checked in on a Tues early afternoon, but by evening we heard others at desk saying there was no parking remaining. They were given back their parking fee, but left to own devices to find parking elsewhere. We never moved our vehicle throughout our stay because we worried we wouldn't get a spot when we returned.  We relied on walking and public transportation through daily passport (which cost more money per person on top of the $27 per night we were charged to house our car.  Breakfast was good, but very crowded, especially as got closer to weekend.  Not enough seating.

Great location for major sights of San Francisco
Stayed here with grown up kids and received a beautiful bright room with view of the Golden Gate bridge.
Easy 10 minute walk down Van Ness to waterside and from there another 5 minutes along water to Fishermans wharf.
Walk straight out of hotel and up Lombard street two blocks to see the crokedest street.
Plenty of small shops for snacks/ drinks around the hotel.
Nice clean and welcoming hotel.
Parking as everyone says is a little challenging. Its under the hotel (enter via Lombard) and is fine if you are a skilled driver. Not so great if you are little nervous or can't judge distances as the turns are a bit tight. Otherwise its safe and well lit.
Negatives: The cattle market that is breakfast. Too few seats and too many people. No trays to take breakfast up to room so people struggle and spill in the elevator.

Nice hotel with location close enough to the warf
Comfort Inn by the Bay was a good choice for location.  It was only 2 blocks from city bus stop, 2 blocks from Big Bus stop, right at the bottom of the back side of Lombard the Crooked Street, and less than a mile walk to the wharf.  The staff was extremely courteous and helpful.  Breakfast had a good mix of hot and cold options.

Not that close to the wharf
The check in was easy. The room was nice, we were on the 11th floor and got the bay view so we were happy when we got into our rooms.  But the problem was you can practically hear everything outside like the noise of the cars, sirens etc. and we weren't able to sleep well even though the bed was super comfy.  The breakfast in the morning? Well, the sausage was hard, the egg wasn't good either.  I know it was free but considering for what we paid,it should be free. My family and I didn't like the walk to the wharf, I thought it will be closer than I expected.  Overall it was an OK hotel but won't be coming back.

Nice hotel, but....
Let me start by saying this is a very nice hotel. Front desk staff was excellent and knowledgeable about the area, especially Sharon. the whole time we were there, and we would come back to the hotel at different times, we NEVER saw a manager.

Our room was larger than I expected, very clean (and stayed that way the whole time we were there), and for a 'partial view' we had a very nice view of the Golden Gate and Lombard Street. We were on the 10th floor. The toilet/shower area is very small and no exhaust fan. The Vanity area (separate from from the shower area) was spacious enough, with storage under the vanity, but so dark I couldn't do my make-up there and my husband had to shave in the full length mirror. I was surprised by the amount of street noise I could hear way up on the 10th floor...even someone calling for a taxi!

The location is great, one block away from the bus that takes you right to Fisherman's Wharf. It's about 3/4 of a mile from the Wharf so you could walk if you wanted. 

Our problems started on our 2nd morning there with the elevators. I was waiting for it with another couple (my husband had gone up a few minutes earlier) and was told one of the elevators was out. They got that one open and out came an old man with a ton of suitcases. Maintenance said we could go in the other one when it opened. We did. We pressed 8 and 10, it went to parking. Went back up about a floor and STOPPED. Now we were stuck. We were stuck for 15 minutes! The first elevator was

Hotel was nice, it is a Hilton. But it wasn't perfect. Halways and our room carpet needed to be scrubbed. Lots of stains. The room was clean, we had a view that was half the hotel next to us and half of the bay. Never heard the any outside noises. Just the family staying in the room next to us. There really isn't anything close by to eat.  Need to drive about 2 miles.

Quiet hotel with a view of the bay. The room was clean and large. The sofa bed was comfortable. We had thought breakfast was included, but it turns out it wasn't, and it's quite expensive. We complained and managed to get it free, which was very kind. The waiter at breakfast was kind. The food was what you'd expect... good variety, but nothing special.

Very nice hotel in South San Francisco.
This is our second time staying at the Double Tree Hotel and our stay was great.  We had a room with a king size bed and a view of the Marina.  The hotel is in South San Francisco and away from the hustle and bustle of the city,  but that's what we wanted.  Driving into the city on a daily basis wasn't a problem at all because the city itself is relatively small (approximately 7 miles by 7 miles).  Our room was very clean, the decor was nice and modern, the front staff was friendly during check in, and housekeeping was great and accommodated our requests.  There wasn't any issue finding parking when we came back to the hotel in the evenings and we stayed during Memorial Day holiday week.  The bed and the pillows were a little soft for my taste, but this is the usual situation at all hotels I've stayed in.  I would stay at this hotel again when visiting San Francisco in the future.

Very nice hotel on a hill by two Cable Car routes.
The hotel is clean and modern. Very handy location to downtown and Cable Car routes.  It is on a hill, but unless cable cars are full, you don't have to climb them.  The lobby is great, with lots of seating, TVs, and great morning coffee.  On the eighth floor, it took until mid afternoon for our rooms to get cleaned, so sometimes when we came back after after a morning outing, we had to leave the room in order for cleaning to take place.  The desk people were great, although I did not like that we were asked to pay for a package deal that included Internet.  To their credit, they did wind up waving the fee, because our booking receipt implied that Internet was free.  Overall, I would certainly stay here again and do recommend it.

Great location..should higher end
I have stayed at Stanford Court many times. Seems to change owners/operators every two to three years. This time they chose a theme of bay area music artists in the lobby and elevators.  Loud annoying music from bands like Journey...cheesy and disturbing.

Rooms have been renovated but not modern or higher end..  food is non existent besides breakfast which is buffet, very expensive and terrible 

Lots of extra charges in bill so be prepared to pay extra $100 per day including something called an urban package which the staff cannot explain.

Has declined in category
Hotel used to be a solid five-star hotel but it has come down a notch in category.  My biggest gripe with the stay is that I paid up for a premier room which supposedly had a bay view and what that meant is that if you stood at one edge of the window and looked diagonally you would catch a glimpse of the bay. Standing squarely in front of the window and looking out treated us to a view on the outside wall of the Fairmont Hotel across the street. I felt ripped off. The room also faced California street and even thought we were on the floor below the top, we had to hear the noise of the tracks at night.  The rooms are small and somewhat dated.  I'm guessing that there are better places in town at the $300 per night price point.

The breakfast was ok.  Good fresh fruit offering, the rest just ok, including the setting, with the tables set out in the middle of the lobby with a shower curtain on one side separating the tables from the buffet line.  Looked kind of low budget.

What's not to love about the Stanford Court hotel? Our room was enormous, plenty of space for a comfortable six day stay. The location is unbeatable, at the top of Nob Hill with everything you could want or need nearby. Our beds were soft and luxurious, we felt well rested each day. Best part? Caviar app had tons of places who delivered to hotel room door so if you were tired from walking up and down San Francisco's notorious hills you can stay in! I loved this hotel and can't wait to go back. Tonga Room is across the street and too cool to skip, make sure you stop in for a cocktail in the rain.

This is a well located hotel.  My two chief complaints were not having room service and not having ice machines on every floor.  However, my room (paid upgrade) was good sized and well designed.  The bar/dining area was pleasant.  A personal dislike:  the front doors--ticky, tacky design--please change them.  The water required to flush a toilet is way too much.  No longer is the Stanford Court on a par of excellence and chic with the Mark, the Fairmont or the Huntington but I liked it very much and will stay there again.

must be the best view in the city
Our room was on the 44th floor (of 48) and all rooms are high.  We had a city view king rather than a bay view, but you get both views from the sky bridge anyway.  The view is dramatic, all the way to the Golden Gate Bridge (if its not foggy)  and only for guests!  The hotel itself has a more residential apartments feel than a hotel, with little in the way of lobby/bars etc and its all very quiet.  The furniture and fittings are a little dated in places, but the bed was very comfy,  it was very clean and room service was lightening fast.  Staff were all helpful and overall it felt like a well run and welcoming place.  Each Friday and Saturday at 5pm they offer free drinks to residents on the 40th floor terrace.  Its worth going to take in the views and that bracing San Francisco breeze!  - on the downside, if its foggy in town you are so high up you cant see the ground...

Everything perfect from check in to check out. Many thanks to Chris at front desk and the doormen including wonderful Eduardo (who is the loveliest man), Michael and Maurio. They do an amazing job - always happy, friendly, welcoming and helpful.  We appreciated late check out (we had a late International flight) and use of hotel facilities until we departed for airport. Room was AMAZING.  Incredible views from the Bridge to Bridge room.  I agree with other reviews - pay the extra and book this room, you will not be disappointed. Housekeeping do a wonderful job, room spotlessly clean and always stocked with high quality amenities and complimentary water - with chocolates at turndown.  We chose to have two dinners in room (5 night stay) as we had the best view in San Francisco. Dinner was fanastic and exceeded our expectations.  We also used the house car, this is a great extra provided by the hotel and the drivers provide wonderful service and are very knowledgable re the Bay Area. The staff at this hotel are exceptional, some of the best service we have received. They are professional and knowledgable and somehow manage to create a 'boutique' hotel experience in a large, luxury hotel. Would highly recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to stay here again.

Stayed at Loews Regency Memorial Day weekend
We stayed at the Loews Regency hotel for Memorial Day weekend. I traveled with my husband and chose this hotel because of location, ranking on TripAdvisor and amenities. We were not disappointed. We had a Jr. Suite with a Golden Gate view which was to die for on the 39th floor. My husband used the gym and thought it was more up-to-date than the Planet Fitness facility he uses at home. The business center is small but serviceable. The hotel staff was fantastic and their recommendation for dining, day excursions, travel route, even parking was always spot on and invaluable. Given our short stay, we needed to bat 1000 on all that we did and working with the hotel staff helped us achieve that goal. I would surely return to the Loews Regency if I get the opportunity to travel to San Francisco again and I'll definitely recommend this hotel to all my family and friends.

We had a wonderful 7 night stay. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again. Good location near the financial district or China town and close to good restaurants.

Nice business hotel with great staff and spacious room. Location is good, walkable to union square and Bart station, the only minus I could think of is the restuarants near the hotel were mostly closed on Sunday.

Omni in need of some updating
Was surprised by how tired the hallways and rugs in the room looked.  Bathroom clean and updated.  Lobby and gym fine, but hallways on floor and room overall felt a bit tired - certainly for a hotel with this high of a rating.

Great location. Central to everything! 
Great lobby entrance gives nice first impression. Easy check-in at front desk. Was greeted pleasantly each morning by cleaning staff. Breakfast was pricey, yet delicious! Drinks in bar were a little too expensive ($16 for vodka/tonic). Great location-central to everything...we walked to fisherman's wharf, union square, Lombard st.-but we like to walk and there were some very steep hills encountered but was nice to see more of the city this way. Staff was friendly!! An aside-dress warm-64 highs in Aug!!!

An Oasis in The Dirty, Noisy, Crowded Storm
I havent been to San Francisco in 20 years and was so surprised at how it has changed.  Maybe I caught it at a bad time, but the streets were filthy with trash everywhere and the streets so crowded that we walked down towards Fishermens Wharf and just turned back due to the congestion.  Anyway....this hotel in the financial district was our veritable shelter in the storm.  It was quiet, clean and whoever manages the staff must have been trained by a 5 star hotel.  It reminded me of the Ritz Carlton in Maui. Everywhere you go there is a smile and a "do you need anything"? They brought milk and cookies to the room every night for my girls. When I asked about the wifi fee, they comped it. When I struggled with the coffee maker, a new one was sent up immediately.  You are going to pay exorbitant amounts while staying in hotels in the San Fran/Napa/Sonoma area, at least here I got my $ worth.

Great location in downtown San Fran.
We arrived via taxi from the airport and initially unsure of the precise location within downtown. The foyer was very busy with two queues waiting to check-in, there seemed to be plenty of staff stood in the foyer also. We eventually got to the front for a quick & efficient check-in. After dropping our bags in the room we headed out and soon realised the hotel is brilliantly located in the heart of downtown. We walked into various stores and bars and spent a great afternoon mooching round. That night we happened upon a great eatery virtually next door to The Handlery, Lefty O'Douls is a big buffet pub, the first we've come across in Canada & the US. The next day we Caught a tram up to Pacific Heights and walked back down Lombard Street. We briefly visited Fishermans Wharf on our way to catch our Alcatraz ferry crossing.

This hotel is right in the center, and walking distance to the mall, with sjopping and restaurants all over. Room is very small with terrible view, but hey, we were barely there ascwe were busy crusing andvsight seein. Staff were extremely friendly and very helpful. We arrived early morning, and plan was to drop off our luggage and come back in the afternoon to check in, but Anthony found as an available room and let us checked in early. Thank you, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay in  San Fran!

VERY pleasant surprise
We stayed in a Premier room on the 7th floor of the hotel. Had heard about Union Square area being very noisy, but our room was very quiet (day and night). Maybe due to double pane glass.
Check-in was quick and we arrived early and they still had a room ready when we arrived 3 hours before check-in.
Hotel is reasonably priced (for SF) and very well located to all the major sights.
Concierge was extremely helpful with both directions and dinner suggestions.
After reading mixed reviews on Expedia and Trip Advisor, we were VERY pleasantly surprised and had an excellent stay.

OK, so their is a trick to the $65 a day parking. When you book your room, look for a "deal" that includes parking, I saved $25 by doing that. #2, Uber is a BIG help, leave your car at the hotel and use Uber. The amount of $$$ you pay for parking around town will be about the same. The only other thing I would add would be the $22 for breakfast in the morning. They really should offer SOMETHING, but for the price of the stay it might cost them too much, it IS San Francisco after all ;P

Nice hotel that is convenient to AT&T park. The staff is what makes the difference with this hotel. If an upgrade is available..its offered. If the Giant's game runs over the car pick up time..there's a minimal charge and luggage can be stowed with the front desk after check out. This hotel really accommodates guests and go out of their way to be helpful and suggest opportunities for making your overnight stay and attending a Giants game less complicated.

I appreciated a lot that we came early, arrive in the hotel at 9:30 a.m.  I wasn't expected to get a room,
but we are lucky, there was one room available. The lady in the counter is very nice, we 
can check in immediately, that I said thousand thanks to her. if not, we have to wait till 3:00 p.m.

Free shuttle to and from the airport. Clean comfortable and very welcoming. Front of house and restaurant staff had the usual American welcome that was very good. No attitude just great service. Usual US hotel free internet is a real positive for UK travellers. 
My room was on 6th floor, very clean comfortable and well appointed. Good air conditioning Filter coffee maker in room with powder creamer - not good for English tea. Fridge in room too 
Only negative was the road noise from freeway - Windows only single glazed so bring earplugs if like me you're a light sleeper 

Breakfast simple but plentiful fresh buffet style 
Definitely recommend to overnight or even city tourists as the price was about half of city centre hotel at same standard.

Nice hotel with easy access to San Francisco
A short one block walk to the San Bruno Bart station and a $4.15 one way ride to downtown SF.  It was a great way to see SF without the hassle of a car and parking.  The hotel breakfast was simple but satisfying.  The food at socials during the week were tasty.  Good place for families with small children to safe money on food.  Lots of working folks staying there too.  With a supermarket across the street and gas grills outside and a kitchen inside, meals were no problem.  We ate most of our lunches and dinners out but having the option of making our own meals was great.  They do what they call light housekeeping if you are staying less than a week - means you get clean towels and a made up bed every day but sheets are not changed.  Pretty much what you'd do at home so it didn't bother us at all.  You also have the option of asking them to change sheets more frequently if you want.  Enjoyed the opportunity to meet other guests too.  Staff was always helpful.  Shuttle to/from SFO was very convenient and timely.

Good place for the family to stay (with a dog)
The whole family stayed in a two room suite while the movers were packing and loading, then we flew out from SFO. A little small, and the bedroom doors are on diagonal walls - which is odd. But the abundance of free food was very convenient.

Trip to San Fran
Pleasant staff. Large clean rooms. Family of five fit comfortably. Close to freeway and grocery store. Was a great 'home base' for our forays into the city. Included breakfast and occasional meals in the kitchenette tampered the high price of eating out in San Francisco.

Clean, cozy and comfortable, plus a welcoming staff and awesome breakfast. Even complimentary laundry room! We loved it here. Only thing to be aware of: the jets flying right over. Very close to airport, after all. This is a benefit, as well, of course. Got to the airport quickly on the airport shuttle. If you need a ride to/from the airport, just let them know. The shuttle is not on a schedule.

The entire group was thrilled with the location close to the airport and mall.  The room was clean and comfortable for all of us.  The breakfasts and fun taco night were enjoyed by everyone.  We were warned ahead about the proximitiy to the airport and flight noise, so we came prepared with earplugs.  (You do need them).  All in all, we enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay there again.

Impressive Staff!
We enjoyed our stay very much! We found the staff very accommodating. The complimentary breakfast was good and the staff worked hard to keep things supplied, the tables clean and the serving areas clean.  We had one of the comp dinners (burgers) and enjoyed them very much. The burgers were grilled outdoors on one of their barbecues. We had an issue with a slow drain in one of the bathrooms. We mentioned it to the front desk and it was taken care of when we returned later that same day. There were other requests made of the staff and they were accomadated. 
Other than sofa bed bedding that continually shifted and bunched up (minor) we thoroughly enjoyed our stay!

Visit to San Francisco
We chose the staybridge for our family of six hoping a suite would avoid the need to book two rooms.  Unfortunately, the staybridge was extremely tight for my husband and me, three teens and a 10 year old.  There is no room for a rollaway and the small beds don't offer much room to share....6 is just too many for their rooms. Also, the hotel is directly in the flight path - landing or taking off from SFO - and the jet noise is crazy loud. It is close the highway for easy access to the city and there are plenty of national chain restaurants around the corner to choose from... but why would you??  You're in SF - head to the city and experience the food found at the neighborhood restaurants!,  the breakfast revive was spotty. There was only one woman working bf each morning and it was a lot for her to keep up with.  The hot water for tea for roomt temperature and requests to make to hotter went unanswered.  Do not even think about arriving for breakfast close to the 9:30 AM cutoff - everything will be removed and items will not be re-filled.

We forfeited our $300+ Non-refundable reservation. There were homeless people outside on a busy busy street, got hit up by a drug addict, staff were rude, room was worse than used frat house furniture, smelled old and musty, parking was horrible (to tight) and if you were unlucky enough to return late = double parking. The cleaning "guy" leared at me - creepy. There wasn't one redeeming quality about this place.

Three things I was not happy with. Office doors was locked after 11pm. No parking was available in the hotel. I was told by the staff that it was OK to park on the streets. Not being from the area and every street needed a permit, I was affrad to get a ticket. That is why I had to get up very early to check on the err car. Finally, Office was still locked around 7am. And was not sure when the breakfast will start.

Poor housekeeping standards
On arrival, we were given wrong directions to room. Bathroom was dirty with previous guest's soap and hair in tub, moldy shower curtain. Coffeemaker had someone's old packet of coffee in filter, housekeeping never replenished our cups so ww had to get our own from the front desk. There was fruit only one of four days for the free breakfast. Front door stuck, hard to open/close. Staff didn't seem to care whether we were happy or not. Great location, but we will never stay here again since there are so many other places to stay in this area.

Overpriced with appalling service.
We chose this hotel purely on the basis of available car parking and reasonable cost, however the car park was small and cramped, with too few spaces for the number of rooms. We daren't use the car for fear of losing our space, and we were blocked in on our check-out day by another guest. The so-called breakfast was the most basic of prepackaged bread, and coffee, however we were not able to even partake of this as the office did not open until 8am (despite staff members being present), and we were told to go away and come back later, which was not possible as we had excursions arranged. The most appalling attitude prevailed from each member of staff, from our check in, right throughout our stay, as though guests were a downright nuisance to them, and they would all clearly rather be doing other things than dealing with the running of the hotel. 

We loved San Francisco, but would rather pay considerably more to avoid this hotel in the future and we would not recommend it to others. The shortcomings of the property could be offset to some extent by improving the customer experience, but I doubt that this will be likely unless a change in management is made.

Great couple of days here!
This stay was far better than I expected. First off, the room was in a great location. We walked to a couple of places. Took an uber and lyft to a couple of other spots. Walk to bused weren't far. Beds were comfortable! Rooms were clean. Also, the staff is very accommodating and the manager is awesome. He was really friendly and helpful to us and we appreciated that. I really enjoyed my stay here and so did my friends. We went for a girls trip for a birthday and it was worth it! The only thing is that our TV didn't work which we could deal with because we were out and about so much. Other than that, we really enjoyed our stay and plan on coming back here again. Side note: walk to the Palace of Fine Arts, it's about a five minute walk. Fisherman's Wharf about a thirty minute walk.

You definitely pay for what you get, but the. Again that is ALL of San Francisco. My room was tiny little room to move around but the bed made up for it in comfort. The location is on the edge of the scary part of town but didn't really mind. If you don't have a car ( I recommend  you  don't bother) most uber rides to all your main tourist  attractionspots were only 7-10 per ride, airport about 30. I would stay here again, was budget  friendly and the Mediterranean restaurant  downstairs  is a must try.

Tight space for 2 queen beds
It's a small hotel with tiny rooms, especially tight with 2 queen beds. There's no loading/unloading zone, but there is a parking garage just a couple doors away. The lobby is fresh, but the rooms and bathrooms are dated. The rooms have radiators but no A/C. The attached Egyptian/Mediterranean restaurant is good and is open until midnight.

Maybe this is normal for SF, but it was my first time in the city. The room was over fragranced (bad for allergies), the room is shockingly small (and I live in Seattle), and the staff didn't remember me 5 minutes after check-in. I was upgraded, so I at least appreciate their effort to make my stay better. And it was pretty in the lobby area.

Decent hotel close to union square
This hotel is close to union square just like other reviewers say. Not a good location but then again you have to remember that hotels in cities are usually next to small restaurants, liquor stores, or bars. If your looking for a safe area then pay extra to stay at Hilton or another big chain hotel. The room is small but you get your own bathroom and the bed was comfy. This hotel is good if you plan on staying 1- 2 nights more than that stay somewhere else so you'll be comfortable. The lobby is nice and modern but everything else is older looking (the stairs, the carpet in the rooms/ hallway). We didn't hear any outside noise or neighbors so we slept comfortably. We only stayed one night for a romantic getaway since we only live 40mins away. we took Bart not sure where you would park your car if you drove. We did a little research and parking overnight is anywhere between $35 and $50.

I was booked a smoking room without my knowledge so the room reeked.  I went to get into bed and there were stray hairs all over the bed.  I called and requested a room change which they did, but would not move me from a smoking room as that is what Expedia booked me.  The next room still reeked and there appeared to be dried blood on the back of one of the pillows.  I chose to leave and sleep at the airport rather than try and sleep in a stinky, smoky room.

Stayed for a week! AC was leaking all over carpet and the bathroom was not cleaned properly upon my arrival. Also, there were limited items available for breakfast. The front desk is very difficult to get ahold of and they don't monitor their guests very well. There were several parties on our floor and the entire floor/our room reaked of marijuana one night. To no surprise - the entire hotel was evacuated due to the fire alarms going off at 12am. During this time there was no communication to the guests about what was going on! No one even told us it was safe to return to our rooms.  We would not stay again!

The front desk clerk stated that she would inform the manager when he came in.  The maid was notified upon check-out.

Hotel by the airport 
I already submitted a review. The hotel walls were dirty and bare. The kitchen in our toom was pathetic. Need more cream and sugar for the coffe bar in the room. Better signs for when room is ready to be cleaned! Cleaning crew came by too early and never came back to clean our room. Overall, I'm disappointed. Will not come back.

Do not stay here!
There was absolutely nothing to eat when I arrived late at night. And now way to get anything. The air/heat in the room was not working properly and I was freezing. The maintenance man said there was nothing he could do. There was nothing to eat in the morning and no way to get it until too late. 
Staff  uncommunicative (except maintenance guy who was friendly). Front desk hard to reach by phone and completely unconcerned about my comfort.
On the plus side - very close to airport and really good beds.

Nice hotel close to airport
We only stayed overnight because we had an early flight and this location was right down the road from the rental car return. It was great though because there was a gas station right next door. Only downside is that you have to pay for parking even though there is no special garage or anything. Room was very clean. The bartender was very unresponsive though. My wife and I sat at the bar for five minutes before being greeted and then asked for a dessert menu and didn't see her again for another five minutes, so we gave up. 

Nice hotel for a quite stay for a flight out of San Francisco though.

Convenient - close to conference center
Arrived late - I got the feeling things were not quite as they should be at the front desk.  I know they were overbooked as they gave me someone else's room.  The manager told the desk clerk to go ahead and re-assign as my room was prepaid.

Dismal Location, Food and Service
This hotel is very near the airport and is located on a strip of similar hotels. The highway runs directly behind this hotel. Be aware that you have to pay extra for parking if you have a car. 

The decor inside is tired and my room, particularly the bathroom, could have been cleaner. There was scuff marks/dirt all along the inside door to my bathroom and the smoke detector was hanging by its wires from the ceiling.

Very noisy, not very clean. There where animal and other people's hair on the bedding and on the towels. Dirtier than I expected, I felt as wearing my shoes in a room since the carpet felt sticky and filthy. Streaks of dirt on the bathroom door, the bathroom door was't staying open, something was wrong with the spring. I will not stay there again. Very noisy, not soundproof.

Have a backup plan for breakfast.
We were told breakfast would be available starting at 6:30am.  We tried at 6:40 and were told the woman that sets up was late and they needed 10 more minutes.  We gave them until 7 before giving up.  They apologized, but come on, your entire operation hinges on one person?  3 people at the front desk and no one was cross trained?  Too bad, I was going to give them a 5 out of 5.

Far from expectations
Our room was spacious, with a large bay window and settee overlooking Market Street.  The hotel seems to have been constructed in 2000+, so the room amenities are newer.  Carpet was discolored.  No free coffee.  Bed was a bit soft.  The bathroom was expansive and functional; I did observe some shoddy workmanship on the tiles.  Water pressure was good, but no bath gels.  Robes and slippers were nice.  Wife didn't like the back alley hotel entrance, and the two-stage elevator ride to lobby then to room.  We did have breakfast at the restaurant and the staff, food, and ambiance were quite good.  Customer service and interaction with staff in general were so-so.  Did not try the Equinox sports club.  So overall, we were left wanting.  Yes, we might have gotten the more pedestrian rooms but still--you don't want your customers to think about St Regis (for next time) around the block.

Second time staying here. It's perfect. The staff is incredibly helpful and accommodating—from front desk to concierge to housekeeping. The beds are luxuriously comfortable. Breakfast in the room was well-prepared and delivered fresh and hot. We were on a high floor and the city views are thrilling. Every hotel should be what this place is. I will never stay anywhere else in San Francisco.

Fantastic Service, Fantastic Location
The service and the location set this hotel apart. We have stayed at several Four Seasons properties in the past, and we appreciate the top-notch service provided by the staff. We were not disappointed by the SF property, at least when it comes to service. Check-in was a breeze, thanks to NaNa, who provided us with some suggestions for our stay. Service requests for extra pillows and room service were handled expertly. 

The location could not be better. You have quick access to a bunch of great restaurants nearby, along with the Metreon (if you want to see a movie), the convention center, and several museums. The Embarcadero and the Ferry Building are minutes away via Muni. 

Our only quibble with the hotel was the quality of the rooms and the decor. The rooms and public spaces felt dated. I am not sure if they have been updated since the hotel opened back in 2001. There was really nothing special about the rooms. They were clean, and functional, but not really true to the Four Seasons brand. They did not feel particularly luxurious or stylish. Also, we could hear quite a bit of noise from the hallway as well as the floor above us.

Overall, the location and service set this hotel apart from the others in San Francisco. However,  we were disappointed by the the ho-hum quality of the rooms. They do not support the $400-$500/night room rate.

Great hotel in the middle of the shopping district
If you are first time visitors to San Francisco and don't know the map, this hotel is in the best area close but not to close to Union Square. This is where everything happens. 
You can easily and nearby get on a tube, a cable car and a bus. You are in the shopping district. You have 10 blocks to the Chinese district and 15 to the North Beach (Italian district). 

The hotel is 5 stars. Period. The staff is super friendly and helpful - from the doorman who greats you every time you enter, the concierge to the reception. 

Clean, clean, clean rooms and you have access to the great gym and an Olympic size pool (we didn't use this since we were too busy). 

I will recommend this hotel anytime and go back again.

We booked this through Expedia and got a good rate. Internet was working 100% and was free of charge as well as a daily newspaper of your choice.

Not a bad place to spend a night.
This hotel is a little old, a little dated and in the middle of nowhere, but is clean well staffed by nice people and fairly comfortable. Check in was easy, even though Expedia screwed up my name again, and it was a slight challenge to find my reservation. This is always a bit scary when the sign out front says "NO VACANCY". In the end they found our reservation and we got the "non-smoking" room we had booked. My wife swears that someone had been smoking in it, but for me the air freshener they used masked it OK. The room was large, but out-dated, even with a smallish flat screen TV. The sliding glass door in back shared a common balcony/walk overlooking the pool. The lock on that door seemed very flimsy and was hard to use. We only opened once and then turned on the AC and locked it as best we could. The bad was OK, the bathroom was OK though the sink seemed kind of flimsy and well used. Over all it worked fine for us as an overnight rest place between days at the racetrack.

We got this room at the last minute while traveling thru California on a family vacation.  
We booked 2 rooms.  The rooms were not very comfortable at all.  The bathrooms we 
very outdated and our daughters room sink faucet was broken so they had to brush their

We were at the Sonoma race track for the weekend, and needed a room close by the track.  This hotel is not far from the race track, and although not walking distance to town, it is only a few minutes away.  We found a great restaurant, sat outside and had a fantastic meal.
 We only stayed one night, and it more than met our expectations in this price range.  If this is in your price range, then we can recommend this hotel.

Nicer than our expensive apartment
We very very impressed with our room at the Fairfield Inn in Millbrae. Not really a room, but it was a suite with separate rooms for sleeping and one for relaxing.  The room was very clean, well appointed and comfortable.
Great bed and pillows!
Best of all was the price; very reasonable for the Bay Area.  Great location, too.
Very close to BART, Caltrain and SFO Airport.
It is also a short easy trip to downtown San Francisco.
The only negatives, the last name on our reservation was incorrect, so it took a few minutes to find our booking.  And, it is close to Caltrain, so the train horns may be audible from some rooms.

Not what we expected from a Marriott Hotel
My husband and I stayed here between our flights from Hawaii to Maryland. We didn't want to make the 12 hour trip so we spent the night in between trips at the Fairfield by Marriott at the San Francisco airport. We had been on a plane for 5 hours. We arrived around 11 pm and had to leave at 4:30 the next morning. When we arrived we got the key to our room. When we got to our room the keys didn't work. Went back downstairs for new keys. When we got in the room it smelled funny and the AC was broken. Back downstairs again for a new room. Got to the room only to find out that one side of the bed was so close to the bump out wall for the AC that my husband couldn't get out of the bed without bumping into the wall. We were so glad we only had to spend 5 hours in the room.
Did I mention the train going by at 3:30 am. The train was blowing the horn a lot.

We dealt with four front desk staff over our stay and all were friendly and accommodating.  Access was easy (you ring for a shuttle from the hotel shuttle area at the airport - be aware that this is on the departure level of the international terminal NOT the arrival level - you have to go upstairs if you are arriving).  Our room was on the ground floor, overlooking the Chinese restaurant car park, but it was quiet enough given the location.  Very central to the BART, local restaurants and a Safeway up the road.  Fridge, microwave and coffee maker provided.  Free newspaper.  Breakfast quite good.  Gym had two runners a cross trainer and small set of free weights.

Reasonably priced near Half Moon Bay. 
The staff was very friendly and let us check in early, on the condition that we took a handicap room.  I would not want a handicap room again as the set up is a little different and not as cozy. I have heard from another hotel that Expedia bookings are being pushed toward handicap rooms. The parking is convenient and easy in a covered garage, which was great since it was raining! The hotel is clean and the breakfast was good and satisfying. The hotel is directly next to a Taco Bell which could be convenient if we did not have an immediate view of Taco Bell drive up. Being in a city you could hear sirens and traffic, but the beds were comfortable and we actually slept very well. I would stay here again as it is only 15 minutes to beautiful Half Moon Bay and 25 minutes to San Francisco without the City prices. The hot tub looked very enticing but it was raining hard, so we did not get to try it out.

A weekend getaway to visit family
The hotel offers amenities that I need.  It is close to SFO airport and Bart/Caltrain station.  I can take the airport shuttle to SFO International Terminal to take the Bart to downtown San Francisco.  Even if I prefer to walk to the Bart station that is close to the hotel, it is a short walk.  The neighborhood offers a good selection of cuisine, in particular, Cantonese dim sum/seafood.  Complimentary breakfast offered at the hotel is also good.  There is a fairly good amount of breakfast choices.  As soon as certain items are gone, these items are instantly replaced by the staff.  Although my stay at the hotel is a short one but I like the location and what it is able to offer to guests.

We stayed twice at this hotel, when passing through San Francisco on a longer trip.  It has a free shuttle to and from San Francisco airport, and we used BART (a short walk from the hotel) to go into San Francisco and return.

Very good location 5 minutes from SFO with free shuttle. 5 minutes walk to Bart stations. Used Bart to AT&T park took 30 minutes. Shopping and dining with lots of options all within walking distance. Hotel staffs and conditions were average. Expect better for the rate they charge.

Cheap for California - you get what you pay for
As I have read in other posts, the hotel is not in the best part of town hence the cheap prices.  You may have a certain level of anxiety staying there.  In order to increase security, though, they have installed many, bright security lights.  You should expect to see many people there with various backgrounds.  The walls in the room are painted in a stucco fashion.  The carpet in my room has seen better days.  The bathroom was ok except for the placement of the bathroom tissue holder (very inconvenient).  The cleaning staff made the bed but afterward did not want to replace the thin, decorative bed accent at the foot of the bed.  Also, they changed the towels but were regularly reluctant to empty the trash or vacuum the floors as necessary.  I did, however, see someone spot check some of the rooms.  Moreover, as in other posts, I smelled cigarette and other smoke that came into my room although all windows and doors were closed.  So, while you may have asked for a non-smoking room, you may come into contact with it anyway.  Additionally, I had to request an ironing board but received a small ironing board that lays on the bed.  You should, moreover, expect to pay the full costs of your stay at the time of check-in.  I will say that the hotel office staff were very helpful.  The upside of the hotel is knowing that they are currently renovating/modernizing the rooms and exterior.  Check back with them in a year or eighteen months and perhaps the accommodations will be better.

Poor. won't stay there EVER
I made a quick reservation - expedia said the hotel was within 3 miles of the venue I was planning on going that night. Turns out it was more like 8 - 10 miles which sucked because of the cab fare - I wanted a hotel within 5 mile radius - Thanks for the lie Expedia. Anyways I wasn't planning on staying in a hotel, but I decided I needed one last minute. I checked in after 3PM and go to find my room - the door was wide open... Do I go in? or wait? I went in because I needed to start getting ready. I had no towels and there were oreos left in the freezer?!?! What in the heck. Honestly, I went to bed hoping that I was sleeping in clean sheets - I probably should have just slept in my car. The area was sketchy and the hotel service was terrible. at least it had free wifi because my service was terrible on my phone. I am glad I had my best friend to share this adventure with though. Wouldn't recommend for the faint at heart.

Very cheap both quality and financially cheap. Walls are thin was able to hear my neighbor. TV was not a flat screen. No fridge unless it's a king room. Door lock was not screwed in all the way. The shower head was incorrect. Couldn't get it in the middle it was either way too cold or way too hot. I would turn it to cold but it was actually hot. Room was just cheap. If you don't care about the quality of the room then stay here, it's inexpensive.

We were a little worried since it does not look good from the outside. Once there the staff was very friendly and the check in quick. Our room was a big surprise since it was newly made. Clean bathroom and toilet and nice beds. There is a fridge and microwave also a Tv. There are a lot of workers, and they were on the weekends pretty loud at night. The motel is off the freeway, but it was not too loud.

Just a cheap place to crash for the night 
The hotel was old, had mold, and was next to a very busy freeway so could hear traffic noise all night (I'm a light sleeper) so if you're a light sleeper, I would not recommend this place. The walls were pretty thin so we could hear the occupants in the next door.

Convenient for BART access!
Aside from the closeness to the BART station (30 min. walk according to front desk staff, or one exit away driving) - there is not a whole lot more that is 'good'. Upon arrival we found the parking lot full of old furniture, mattresses etc.which made us wonder if the 'hotel' was even open! It was. Room on second level offered two beds as booked, a wobbly fridge, a coffee maker, a shower with 'either' cold or hot water (no mix available!) and a door frame through which daylight was visible. No food service of any kind close by, except back at the BART station (El Cerrito North).

Surprisingly nice stay!
The outside appearance of this motel was not very appealing at all. We were kind of scared to stay, however when speaking to the manager, he assured us that we were in a good area. But, as we moved in to our room, we were happily surprised!  The room was clean, the bed were so comfortable, and it smelled very nice. We slept very good on the mattresses; the bathroom was clean and updated. We were very happy with our room. 

We plan to use this motel again when we are back in the area. As the renovations are completed, we're hoping that the outer appearance catches up to the inside.

Thanks!

Run down but convenient location
The hotel is close to the freeway so there's easy access to Berkeley (which is 10 minutes south). The area of town is marginal, and the motel is very dated. But the bed was comfortable. The sink is outside the toilet/shower room, a short distance away, and is very small. I won't go back, even though the price is one of the best in the Berkeley area.

The toilet required 5+ flushes to work. The Shampoo and Conditioner bottles could not be squeezed to use the content.  Looked like they were "refilled" on site and not new containers. The biscuits were soggy on the bottom where they sat in a humid heater.  The English muffin fell apart in my hand when I tried to cut it in half to place in the toaster.

It's a decent hotel, no fancy bells or whistles and no red flags. Clean and comfortable. I appreciate the complimentary shuttle to and from the airport and the small complimentary breakfast(essentials). Made life easy. It took about 25 to 40 mins to get into dowtown San Francisco. Über and Lyft were cool for that. Was about 15 to 20 dollars each way. A little more at night since it was super bowl and people were everywhere.  Overall no Complaints. Tess the front desk lady was also awesome :)

Better than expected!
I was worried when I saw this hotel had 2 1/2 stars. I initially thought I had booked the Holiday Inn Express in Burlingame and that had better reviews. I was pleasantly surprised upon check-in. Our room was very spacious, the bed was comfy and the seating area was great! Each room has a larger than average hotel fridge and a microwave. The room does have blackout shades despite some of the reviews on here. I'm not sure how people missed them! 
Breakfast has many options and it's free! Parking wasn't an issue at all. They do charge $10, but we knew that going in as it is stated on the website. Considering it's near the airport you have to expect this. Larger hotels charge even more to park. The only complaint I had was the air freshener used in the room. It needs to be toned down quite a bit as our clothes even smelled of the scent. I would recommend this HIE to a friend.

Great value and location next to SFO
We've been staying at the HIE for several years now since we discovered how close it is to everything we need in a hotel room when visiting family in the City.  First of all, rather than to stress out my elderly mother who has to deal with water rationing penalties during drought conditions and laundering linen etc., we decided to give her a break several years ago and "just get a room."  At first it was awkward, not staying with family....but honestly, I think everyone is much more relaxed.  We can make it to the car rental center in minutes down the road, get our own breakfast downstairs in the lobby for a quick bite, get on the freeway two blocks away, shop at Costco next door for flowers, gifts, supplies etc. and not pay through the nose for a room in the City where you're most likely going to have your car broken into than here at the HIE.  

The hotel front lobby staff have been here for several years and recognizable by their pleasant, efficient and friendly welcome each and every visit.  When someone enjoys their work, it shows and these ladies are the best!  The rooms are clean, have a little fridge, microwave and coffee pot.  Bathrooms are a bit dated and the toilets need several flushes to down the t.p., but all one needs.  Flatscreen televisions, working heater/ac unit and efficient housekeeping rounds out a pleasant stay.  There's even a McDonald's directly next door if you run into the midnight munchies.

Very Nice Location and Accommodations

We were in San Francisco for our great-nephew's graduation and had to travel from San Francisco to South San Francisco, and other locations.  This hotel was greatly located, the accommodations were excellent.  The staff was helpful and friendly.  The coffee - VERY good (especially early in the morning) and parking was very convenient.  
I would recommend this hotel to anyone who needed/wanted to stay in or near San Francisco proper, and yet wanted the quiet of a local hotel an not the overwhelming hustle and bustle of a huge hotel.

We were very satisfied with location the hotel as we were taking a morning flight the following day. The early breakfast was very good and complete with many items. The staff was quite helpful and pleasant.  Th rooms were roomy and great for a good night's sleep.  The only concern was that the bright light directly out our window was overwhelming, however, we found the room darkening shades the next morning. The price, with the added taxes, was a little pricy, but not unusual in San Francisco. The confusion with the other Holiday Inn Express was difficult for family coming to visit us at the hotel.

The key to the room assigned to me did not work, but I had to complain to the woman in the office several times before she believed me and checked it out for herself. She lacked all people skills and certainly should not be working with the public. ~ The wi-fi connection did not work, and, once again, the woman argued with me about that. She said she would show me how to access it with my laptop, which I thought was condescending; I told her I knew how to access it: the problem was that the password was wrong. Again, she argued with me, so I just gave up. ~ The toilet was broken, and I could barely get it to work.

I had to be in San Francisco all week and I used this hotel because of its location and price.  The structure was very old and had upgrades over the years.  Still, I would call the room only adequate because of size and amenities.  Just reminded me of "old."  The wifi was cumbersome but worked.  For the price and purpose, it fit my business needs, but I would never use it for a family visit.

All rooms face the freeway which is close and loud if you open the window. Bed is crammed against the air conditioner causing it to cycle on and off frequently and fairly noisily  Room is stuffy without open window or air on. 
Very forceful shower not suitable for kids.  Beds were two doubles, not queens as advertised but reasonably firm and plenty of pillows. Room was clean and TV good. Being in Marin apparently justifies the exorbitant price for what is a bare bones hotel.

Staying here makes you feel like a loser
 One of the two bedside lamps has the smallest, dimmest light bulb (twisty) that you can find.  The other beside lamp didn't have a bulb in it at all.  I discovered that while putting my hand upside to see if the bulb was loose.  Thank God the lamp  happened to be in the "off" position, because one of my fingers went inside the socket!  The overhead light had two sockets, but only one bulb inside.  Again, very small and dim.  There was one other lamp on a very tiny table pushed into the corner of the tiny room.  The lamp did not have a bulb inside.  The bathroom sink has it's hot water is turned off somewhere upstream of the fixture.  When I turned on the hot water facet, absolutely no water of ANY temperature came out.  I checked the valve under the sink and it was open.  So it's off somewhere else upstream.  The top of the pop-up drain plug was broken off/missing.  So it was impossible to fill up the sink.  I guess even if it wasn't broken, it would have been difficult to fill up the sink, anyway, because the attachment point for the pop-up was missing.  The sink is a pedestal sink, so there is no counter.  There is no toilet paper holder.  The toilet paper sits in a basket on top of the toilet.  No biggie, except that I had to keep removing the top of the toilet to figure out why it wouldn't flush.  The shower is 28" x 30".  Compare that to an old fashioned shower that is 36" x 36". I couldn't direct the shower water to flow directly on body below the waist.

Right next to loud freeway.
Depressing, unwelcoming desk service (very unhappy desk clerk). Cramped run-down rooms (bed up against window). One room had leaking faucet that could not be turned off (clerk was not surprised or concerned). After complaining and switching rooms twice, we were upgraded to a nicer larger unit which was more comfortable, but the heater was noisy and ineffective, no closet or pegs to hang clothes, a back window on the alley that could not be locked, and still loud freeway noise. The woman who did housekeeping (limited English) was warm, friendly and helpful, and I liked and trusted her. Overall, we saved some money, but it still wasn't cheap; I expected better. Will not return or recommend.

Value and Location



This hotel is well located to transportation, shopping, and sights.  Very close to Market Street where you find many buses and trolley cars. Close walk to cable cars. Less than 2 blocks is the Powell stop for BART...great connection to and from airport. I recommend buying a Clipper Pass for ease in using transportation...available at airport and Walgreen drugstores. Dining places are to be had throughout the neighborhood.  The hotel has quite an adequate breakfast room, serving from 6 to 10 am daily and staffed with exceptionally friendly staff members.  Some reviews noted many homeless in this neighborhood. Yes, there are some homeless around; however, I was never bothered by any of them coming and going at the hotel which is quite secure.  Much of downtown SF has a homeless issue; it's just part of the local color. Didn't have a good meal in SF.............avoid the Big 4 on Nob Hill....mediocre food at elevated prices and attitude-soaked waiters. Food at Hotel Zetta...less than mediocre at inflated prices coupled with thick attitude.  Best bargain in town...crab and shrimp sandwiches at stalls at Fisherman's Wharf.

On a recent trip to San Francisco for a Giants game, we decided to make it a weekend get-a-way.  The Hampton Inn was the perfect choice. We were able to walk to and from the game, even though it was a night game. The location was ideal. The hotel staff was warm and welcoming. Our room was spotless! A bit on the small side but comfortable. Although the Giants lost...we won with our choice of Hampton Inn:)

Vacation
No where to  park and valet was $64 a night. Room was tiny. Had a desk jammed next to the bed and a chair jammed in between. Couldn't even walk thru that side or sit in the chair it was so close. TV was hung on the wall on  left side of the room and you couldn't even turn it to get a better view.

Nice hotel but not in a good area
The hotel is nice, staff is great, comfortable bed.  Everything was clean.

The location is bad, it's located in the middle of what is known as the "tenderloin area" in San Francisco.  No basic parking available through the hotel.  Only valet at $60 per night.

Tidy, cozy, great location and breakfast.
Everything was very clean and organized. I was at a conference at the Moscone center so the location was perfect. Breakfast included a large variety options and was delicious.
The ladies in the kitchen even made me a goodie bag for my flight before I left. 
Thanks so much!

Unsafe to stay here
After i checked in about to go to the room there were couple of homeless in the elevator and good thing about this you need to get a key in the elevator in order to go to the room , one guest called fromt desk to come and ask those homeless to get out on way out he said he doing business here seriuos he drunk and he also tried  to hit me but luckily it was not happened. Im very scared because i didnt expect this to happened in Hampton inn hotel after that hotel GM called me to apologize he also mentioned that homeless were everywhere you go in this area but i think they not supposed to be in the hotel, hotel need to be safe place to stay anyway he asked me if i need a new hotel well i told him im not moving anywhere but make sure you have security at the door will be fine for me however the next day i still see the other homeless tried to get into the elevator also i never seen any one of security of my whole stay so definitely will never come back or recommend to people. Moreover we do a valet there and my rental car got hit and run fortunately i bought a full cover insurance so no need to do anything i cant imagine that if im not have insurance i need to deal with police and other and my vacation ruined so i hope this worst experienced help people to be aware of this hotel management . Ps i had ask for late check out as we had such a terrible experience there guess what hotel were full even i willing to pay for half day  i still need to get out of there. Good luck

I was in San Francisco for a conference. This hotel was well price and just blocks from the Moscone Center. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. The room was perfect. It had a safe and a small refrigerator, neither of which I expected but we're welcome additions.  The bathroom was good sized and both it and the room were clean.

okay for business
Parking for valet was over priced, but the security staff recommended a good parking lot for the weekend. I was disappointed that the advertised roof access was closed due to maintenance. The room was a lot smaller than I thought it would be. no room to maneuver around the bed. Also the bed was on wheels, so it kept sliding away from the wall/headboard.

The breakfast was closed up by 9:15 on the Saturday we were leaving, so we couldn't grab a quick coffee. :(

The lobby, elevator and view were all great. The place was clean, likely because it's new. 
Short stays for 1 are perfect for this hotel.

If you need to be downtown SF...
Face lifted hotel right near Powell BART. Perfect to stay close to shopping and NYE festivities. Next to Westfield, Blue Bottle. Occasionally pungent on the outside, but comfortable on the inside. Reasonable price for downtown location. Pretty good service. Check-in before 3 a no-no. Late check-out is noon.

Very nice hotel, not the greatest neighborhood
This is a very nice hotel.  We found a great price for it on expedia.  The hotel staff was very helpful and the room was very clean.  It was also very quiet, which was a nice surprise for a San Francisco hotel.  The beds are comfortable but quite small.  The valet parking is expensive, but there are public parking garages located very close by for half the cost.  The only drawback to this hotel was the neighborhood.  It didn't feel the safest.  We witnessed a few fights and had a few people say things to us as we were walking to public transportation that made us uncomfortable.  Other than these few instances, we really liked the hotel itself.

Hotel was centrally located in city, close to transit and the Bart if you don't want to drive in city. Hotel was comfortable with nice bar on first floor, and another bar with a great view on the 39th floor. no sit down restaurant in hotel if you come with kids. Only problem with location was the amount of homeless along sidewalks in area. But that seems to be same issue in most large cities.

Marriott is always good.
We stayed at this Marriott downtown and it lived up to the Marriott reputation. Service was excellent and room was comfortable. It is downtown so always very busy in the lobby and very pricey. Everything extra such as parking, in-room wifi, breakfast, etc. was an expensive additional cost. Location was very convenient to public transportation, shopping, and restaurants. Some of the sightseeing spots would require more than walking.

Good hotel in a great location. 
The hotel has over a 1000 rooms and is mainly used as a convention hotel. The week that we stayed there the hotel was sold out. The facilities are great. There is a sky lounge on the 39th floor that had amazing views. It was packed every night with people who wanted to witness the sunset. The wine and food selection was unparalleled. The rooms while spacious were very clean and comfortable, but need updating.

Centrally located to entertainment
Our stay had a rocky start, but ended beautifully. The driveway to check in and drop off bags was extremely crowded for a Sunday afternoon. It took quite a while to pull up to the door to unload our bags while my better half checked in since we were planning to self-park. Despite requesting early check in, our rooms were not ready until almost 5pm. Then everything became better. Our room was beautiful with views of the bay, and feather free as requested due to our allergies. After a fantastic dinner at Coi, we returned to our room to enjoy the city lights. The next morning, we had a nice breakfast that was included with our stay. The area surrounding the hotel was fun to walk around, especially with the beautiful weather.

Great location - extremely busy hotel 
Stayed for 3 nights for vacation. Mom/daughter/granddaughter 

This hotel was huge- but in a great location. no matter what time of day or night- that lobby was completely packed.  we walked everywhere. Even used Bart to/from airport and the station was only 1 block over. 

Super clean, super comfortable- and really roomy for 3 ladies. We had 2 queen beds- big closet and bathroom.

The guy that checked us in was super friendly and went over a few locations with map. we left our maid a tip and she came by to thank us, so nice. 

Only disappointment in the whole place was that the bar at the top was so wildly crowded Friday night that there was just no way to get a drink and enjoy the gorgeous view from there.

Flew in from Columbus, OH and arrived several hours before check-in. They were able to find an upgraded room that was available right away. The lobby was very, very nice. The staff was incredibly pleasant. The room was very clean and updated. The hotel bar (The View) on the top floor had a spectacular view of the city. I even visited the hotel gym which was nicer than almost any gym I've ever been to. Incredibly clean and updated! Taxi/Uber/Lyft drivers right outside for easy convenience. Great hotel!

Cute little hotel, close to Union Square 
The rooms were small and not every room had an air conditioner, but with SF weather you might be okay with just the ceiling fan!  If you google Tenderloin district it is "technically" I'm that area... However, so is some of Union Square. I felt safe the entire time. I think the bad area is further west. It was a cute, clean and great price for being 2 blocks from Union Square. If you want the Hilton, keep looking. If you want a nice hotel for a place to lay your head at night and shower in the morning without breaking the bank you should book!

Parking alone screams stay away
It took me almost 30 minutes of driving around to figure how to get into Ellis St, so I called the hotel and the lady told me that parking was in the front. She never mentioned anything about there being no access to this street unless I mad a U-turn. Parking is $51--park elsewhere. The gentlemen the in the from if the hotel were nice and more helpful. 

The room was clean and had a unique design; too bad no desk to work for a two bed room. 

Wifi is clean and free, and they offer free continental breakfast from 8-9.

The elevator needs some fixing; it made horrible sounds. Overall, the location is in a busy area which is great for shopping and dining. However, the fact that there is no free parking is a major downer. Also, it is noisy at night and day. Wouldn't return there.

Noisy but nice
We had a large room on the front of the building. Number 402, as I recall. Some might think it noisy. But at night I enjoy the "music of the city" - car horns, voices, sirens, etc. During the day, there was construction going on in the hotel but we weren't there during the day. No big deal. So it might not be everyone's choice. But I would certainly stay there again. The staff are friendly and helpful, the location is very close to Union Square and all the major stores. By the way, the gym was tiny and the continental breakfast quite basic. Those items were not important to me.

Noisy, but clean and comfortable
Staff were friendly and helpful. The bed was comfy, and the pillows too (pillow menu was available if you needed it) and the room was clean, and staff did a good job keeping it that way. Conveniently located near macys and barneys and a couple of walgreens and the cable cars. a 30 min walk to chinatown or fishermans wharf (depending on which street you used it could be steep)

Colleague and i booked the same room from expedia, and got very different rooms. Theirs was a large room with plenty of space but a small bathroom with a shower over a small tub and basin in the bedroom. Mine was a very small room (not enough space to have suitcase out and get around the bed) and a large bathroom (put suitcase in there) with a proper shower, but no space around the sink for brushes and toothbrush etc.

I had a room overlooking the inside of the building, and it sounded like a very noisy aircon was on the whole time outside. Turning the rooms aircon on only made it even louder. My ipad volume was barely loud enough to be heard using it's speakers.

My punishment for goofing up my travel plans
Needing to stay in this hotel was my punishment for making a mistake in my travel plans. Got it at the last minute on Saturday night.

Wow.... what a dump...and Expedia made me pay a high price to stay in a place that most travels would avoid at all cost. Other nearby "Nice" hotels were about the same price... just sold out.

On the good side:  My car was not stolen or damaged, Did not get bed bugs (that i know of yet), we were close to the airport.  My hurt knee (from going downstairs with heavy suitcases due to no elevator) is better now... The staircase was very steep and narrow... Surprised it even meets hotel building codes... was more like a fire escape than stairs.

On the bright side:  The same gentleman that checked us in late Saturday night and then checked us out 8 hours later in the morning was very nice and professional.

Ridiculous Stay at a 2.8 hotel! 
I had to pay a deposit of $100 and my credit card did not have a chip so I had to go and get cash out in order to get my room because the staff member said in order to reserve the room every credit card has a chip and with the one I had it was not possible. This is ridiculous because I travel all the time especially to Hawaii and NEVER had this Experience! Talk about Inconvenience... It's not even a 5star hotel! I reserved this room last minute but will NOT be going there again! Customer Service is a Big Part of Business!

Worst hotel ever
Worst place we've ever stayed. If there wasn't the " no refund " clause in booking this place we would have stayed night in car on side of road, that's how bad it was. A/C did not work, large wood valance for curtain fell on me injured arm. Reported to front desk, they told me "we didn't see it happen" you must have did it somewhere else. Holes in walls in bathroom and no hot water.

Very smelly Floor very dirty Used shoes @ all time
Will neve use this place any more.
We vent there only because all normal places were full. I would not go there even if I would need to sleep in my car again. I only did stay there because I have three kids and we would not fit in the car sleeping.

The cleanness of room is not bad. But the hotel is just next to the freeway and the air conditioner was a bit noisy.

Seems there was no fitness room.

Considering its price, it's not a bad choice.

Just what we wanted
This hotel was perfect for us. It was reasonably price and the location was good for us. It had off street parking so once we got there we walked, used a taxi, or a tour bus. The staff was helpful and suggested many things to do to make out trip better!
It was not a fancy hotel with amenities but we came to San Francisco to see the city not hang out in our hotel room!!

Second time at this hotel, even better this time
My husband and I stayed here in 2012 and thought the room was clean and basic but that's what we were expecting. We loved the proximity to the marina and the fact that it has free wifi, mini fridge, and free parking. This time was even better (2016). We got an updated room with nice laminate flooring and stone countertops, also we had a nice street view of Lombard and was able to open the window for the breeze and background city noise (if ur into that). They offer free breakfast and the little patio is nice to sit on while having coffee with a nice city and water view. It's no Ritz but I love this little hotel..ESPECIALLY for the price, that's why we came back again. 👍🏼

Perfectly fine 2 star hotel in San Fran
If you need to stay in San Fransisco on a budget then this place is perfectly fine. Don't expect too many frills, this is 2 star hotel for sure. However the rooms are clean and the facility kept in good order. The staff were very nice and helpful. Breakfast is a bit of joke, don't rely on it if you have a long day of walking to do around the city.

Nice M/Hotel steps away from the Presidio
Room was exceptionally clean! Steps away from Presidio and Marina. One block down on Chestnut St are all the restaurants and delis so you can dine to fit your budget. If you're willing to climb the hills of Frisco, you're a 25 min walk to the Painted Ladies and the tour bus stops. 10 min in the car will take you to the Wharf all from a Motel on famed Lombard St. Oh and we are breakfast outside everyday!

Cheap tickets available for Airport Shuttle (we called the hotel upon arrival at airport, and they told us where to find the correct Shuttle).  Hotel location was convenient to where my daughter and I wanted to be.  Front office staff was  friendly and helped carry our luggage upstairs.  They also kept it stored on our check-out day until it was time to take the Shuttle back to the airport in the evening.

No elevator, when your tired from a long day of traveling the last thing you want to do is lug 3-50lbs bags up 2 flights of stairs.
T.V. did not work, they came up 2 days later to fix, but within 24 hours it quit working again.
room was dirty.food or some other substance smeared on the walls. they only gave 1 bath towel, and the towel were worn and torn, and when you want to have a shower at night and 1 in the morning you had to track down
housekeeping in the morning to get another towel. Patio was filthy and unusable. They deleted are access cards before our stay was over. Breakfast, what little they did offer had no place to sit down and eat it, you had to haul 
it to your room. The free parking is limited to ask few spots, and usually none available if you are not back by 6:00pm, then you get to try to find an place to park, good luck with 
that.
This would be able fine overnight hotel for under $75.00 dollars. Not worth going for a long term stay like we had, and paid over $100.00 and night.

Good experience overall
We had a good experience here. It had everything we wanted: close to major attractions, free parking, breakfast, comfy bed, and heater. Yes it is on a busy street, but it didn't bother us considering how tired we would be at the end of the day. Only complaint is that when we took a shower, the mist revealed some yellowing next to the toilet that most likely was urine! So I definitely recommend a better more thorough cleaning of hotel rooms.

Noisy overpriced motel.
For the amount of money, I paid, I would have expected conditions to be somewhat as close to Holiday Inn level as possible. I paid a fee greater than it should have been, for one night, and half would have been okay for this place. I would not book here again and as a travel agent, I would not recommend this place to my clients. As I said before, half would have been okay. I do want to add that this place in not terrible, the staff was great but okay is the best rating I can give this place.

Free parking and great location! But noisy
Free parking in a really great, walkable area of the city! That's the best selling point really - and it really was a great location for walking to Fisherman's wharf and the whole Pier 39 area and it was easy to uber around if you didn't want to have to find parking elsewhere. However, either the walls are very thin or people are really loud in this area. We woke up during the nights a couple times from loud traffic and people yelling. You know it's rough when they leave you earplugs as a welcome gift ;) but it was still tolerable as long as you're aware of it and the place was clean and very convenient! Still would recommend.

Staff was friendly and helped get checked in at a very late hour.  Parking is ridiculously cramped but they allowed me to squeeze in to a non-parking spot overnight until I could get a spot in the morning.  Room was small but cozy and cleaner than most.  If you need a base while you sightsee in San Fran this would be a good hotel for you, provided you are spending most of your time elsewhere (not the hotel).  Would definitely recommend to others.

This is a very conveniently located hotel to get downtown.  Two bus lines are available within a block of the hotel and at $2.25 a ride it could be the best value you'll find.

The staff is very friendly and helpful.  When we registered we were given a map and he circled all the tourist highlights.

Breakfast included coffee, tea, 2 juices, assorted fruits and pastries. The pastries  and bananas were usually slightly past their prime. 

While we didn't have a car, there was parking for approximately 50% of the rooms.

The rooms were a little small but very clean.

1 Night stay. Close to the Airport.
We chose the Comfort Inn because of it's close location to the San Francisco Airport. We came off a cruise and wanted to stay 1 extra day to do a bit of touring. We arrived at Comfort Inn at approximately 9 a.m. and they stored our luggage for us and off we went touring. When We came back about 3 p.m. we checked in. They upgraded us from a King Bed Standard room to a King Bed Suite which was a pleasant surprise. Our 1 night stay was enjoyable. Everyone must remember when You stay at a Hotel near an Airport You will hear Airplanes occasionally. It did not bother us.
We got a free breakfast in the morning and free shuttle bus to the Airport.

Great experience
We were pleasantly surprised at the spaciousness of the room (two queens). It was more than enough room for all of us. Everything was clean and well maintained. And of course, the breakfast was wonderful. The full breakfast was why we chose Comfort Inn. We also liked that the stairs were well lit and seemed like they were a part of the hotel not just an emergency exit. We are a family that would much rather take the stairs rather than an elevator, so not having to go out of our way or in some dark, dirty back stairwell was very welcomed.

Nice hotel in the middle of nowhere!
We stayed for a week to visit San Francisco and vicinity.  This hotel was very nice, clean and the property was well kept.  It had free breakfast everyday and free evening "dinner" Mon thru Thurs.  The staff was very nice, and so were the other guests.  The air conditioning was very quiet, and the bed were comfortable.  There was no restaurant in the hotel.  If you wanted a meal, other than the free meals, you had to walk across the way to the next door hotel.  It is located about 15 minutes to San Francisco and about 10 minutes to the airport.

The view from our room was of Route 101, an exit ramp, and CALTRAIN tracks.

Keep in mind that if you stay here, you are going to need a car.  Also, there is a lot of traffic in SF, and wherever you go, you are going to wait on long, slow lines.  

Other than that, we had a good time.

I have traveled all over the United States,and stayed at great hotels.
The staff hospitality was on par with the Waldorf in New York.
Excellent value and location for the price
Close to all freeways,take the coastal drive on Ca 1 South and Ca 1 North,if Muir Woods is full you can see Redwoods along Ca1 North.
Napa Valley and Sacramento are close for the day.
Also take Grey Line for 2 day hop on hop off,as well as their Alcatraz and Bridge water tour, great way to see San Francisco.

Ok
The hotel was ok, the rooms were smaller than you'd expect for an all suite hotel and the walls are THIN. I mean we could hear everything. The people next door had their radio on and we hear every beat of the song... Anytime someone came down the hall we could hear it... And anytime someone else's door was opened it sounded like someone was coming in our room so I was woken up a few times thinking someone was trying to get in our room. The room was decently clean. Breakfast was a bit of a nightmare- very small room for the number of guests and no order to the lines or way things are set up so you were constantly in the way of someone and being pushed around. Even though it was quite chilly that morning we braved the outdoor area just to get out of the dining room. The pool is very small and every time we went to go swim it was so crowded we couldn't get in. Might've just been an extra busy weekend but we were bummed we couldn't take advantage of that. 

Our dealings with the front desk were always pleasant and the location of the hotel was nice. We took a walk at the marina across the street and it was very peaceful and beautiful. I'd recommend if you got a really good deal, nothing to write home about though.

Good location, well kept, but small.
We have stayed in Homewood Suites in many states and expected the facility to be like the others.  This hotel was OK, but the suite felt smaller than represented on the photos. The kitchen in particular was so small you could not open the dishwasher door fully - or the fridge door, either.  They banged into each other - not enough floor space between them.

Not too close to the airport, very close to SF!
We had a lovely stay at Homewood Suites.  I didn't have to cook ONCE because there was breakfast every morning and "dinner" almost every night - not Friday to Sunday.  Javier was also generous with the wine and beer!  The eggs weren't the best, but they were palatable.  I am gluten & cheese intolerant; and, I could find something to eat.

We only had a few "issues".  The biggest was that our toilet kept clogging.  However, the problem was solved only minutes after each report - it happened three times.  Every front desk person I encountered was attentive and professional.  The other was that our room was so close to the exit ramp to the highway.  It was fine for 6 of the 7 nights, but on our first night a cop pulled someone over using a megaphone at 3 am!  (Not the Hotel's fault, but the proximity did not help.)  There was no view from this side of the hotel, but we weren't there to see SF from the room.

TIP: There is parking at the corner of Jones and Beach near Fisherman's Wharf for $10.75 IF you get there before 10am!!

Pre-Flight Hotel Stay
The hotel is showing signs of wear, and the beds were decent, but the pillows a little flat. We had a 2 bedroom suite and the pull out couch did not have linens, but the staff was awesome and had them to us right away. The breakfast was excellent, and the two gentleman the were helping in the breakfast room were FANTASTIC!!!! When you travel with a family the includes 2 small children and 3 generations you need a little extra and these two helped carry plates, cleaned up after the kids and made sure we had everything we needed. All of the staff were helpful and very pleasant.

Renovations in progress.
We enjoyed our stay, but we were not aware that renovations were under way.  The elevator was not working, though fortunately (or unfortunately) we were on the first floor in a handicapped room (none of us were handicapped), so at least we did not have to climb stairs.  The breakfast was great, and I am sure the facilities will be wonderful when the renovations are complete.  Because we were on the first floor, we did not have any kind of view, which would have been nice as the motel is near the water.

I had stayed at a different Hotel the night before. A well known hotel in every state but cheaper in cost (and known to be cheap) so my expectation of that hotel vs. the Hampton Inn was lesser of the two since The Hampton Inn is by Hilton Inn & Suites. Well I was very disappointed to find that the room at the Hampton Inn was much smaller, the bathroom was way smaller, the bed wasn't as comfortable, the breakfast wasn't all that great, the staff at breakfast don't smile at you and they had staff on their hands and knees cleaning the floors by the elevators with a small brush in hand. I thought it was a safety issue since it was during check out time (11am) so the floors were wet, we had to walk around staff on their knees and try not to slip and fall and I thought it was belittling to staff. If that's the protocol for cleaning floors at The Hampton Inn then it should be done during sleep hours so that you don't place customer's at risk.

Unexpected!
Staff was very friendly and our room was very clean and comfortable.  It looked like it was newly refurbished.  The bathroom was well stocked with bath supplies and the towels smelled like they were just freshly laundered! An added plus was the the great drainage in the shower! We've stayed in 5 star hotels where the shower drain is clogged up and this riles me to no end!   The bed was firm and very comfortable, the linen smelled fresh and clean. The only complaint I have is the hallway outside our room.  During our entire stay, I don't believe they vacuumed the carpet; the same small pieces of paper strewn on the carpet was still there when we checked out! Overall, for one who favors staying at the nearby Westin whenever we travel this area, I would definitely stay in this hotel again!

The hotel was clean, beds OK.   There was not a heavy drape on the window for total security (darkness) which was my only compliant.    Breakfast was good with basic choices available.    Only one Bus to SFO, which left every half hour, which means that you get picked up at airport only every half hour.   Most hotels has a more frequent schedule.

Nice hotel but it seems like the staff isnt well t
Stayed for one night.  Front desk check in was pleasant and efficient.  Got to the room and was greeted with a sign saying, "Enjoy complimentary bottled water".  However, there was no water at all.  I wouldn't have expected it if the sign wasn't there, but if they say they are giving me something, then they should have it there.  Perhaps a problem with the housekeeping staff.  

In the morning, we arrived for breakfast only to find the hot items were out.  The person filling them appeared to be filling them but after waiting there for some time with no food forthcoming, we asked her if she was filling them.  She snapped at us in a rude way that "they are coming" as if we were bothering her by even asking if more would be coming out.   It was kind of surprising coming from someone in the entertainment industry.  She saw us waiting there and it was obvious what we were waiting for.  She should have at least acknowledged that she was filling them without us asking.  And then, to be answered in such a rude way was kind of disappointing.  

Overall it was a fine stay but we were definitely taken aback by that.

Horrible experience
Staff member did not greet my boyfriend and I. He wasn't even friendly while checking us in. We tried to ignore him and enjoy our trip. When we went to the room, the toilet was dirty, the bath tub looked like it had a sticky residue left from the bottom of a bathmat, AND the bed sheet had a piece of hair and some sort of stain. I called the front desk and asked for new sheets. He told me,"come downstairs and I'll give it to you" I said,"can't you send someone else to bring it up?" He said,"I'll be right there" AND HUNG UP ON ME. He gets to the room and puts out his hand with the sheets like we bothered him for coming up to give it. My boyfriend then said"who's going to change it?" And he says,"You". Then I said,"So we check into a dirty hotel with dirty sheets and we're supposed to change it? You don't have a maid or anything?" He says,"No maid right now". My boyfriend then says,"Take those sheets back cause we're not staying here". And he says,"Okay that's fine, I'll give you back your money". I'm from Pacifica! I did not think this experience was going to be this bad. The room was $123 dollars. Are u kidding me?

Disgusting and Horrible customer service
When we first got the hotel we notice the toilet backed up full of toilet paper. My husband was at the store so I called front desk. The attendant told me for ME to go downstairs and get a plunger. I could not believe it. I went downstairs and asked again if there was a maintenance man and he said no, I asked can you go do it? and he said no, I asked can we get another room and he said no! I said told him it was very unprofessional and he said to leave a review. I would have left but there was no rooms available, we were tired & it was late. I asked my 14 y.o. son to unplug it and as he was trying a CONDOM came up floating... disgusting!!! When my husband came back he went to the front desk and demanded them to do their job. The attendant had the guts to suggest it was us (even though we had been in the room for 2 minutes when I called him). After arguing with my husband for a bit, all of a sudden they DID have a maintenance guy &  a snake to fix the toilet. They came upstairs 5 minutes later and fixed it... but not before leaving a dripping mess all over the bathroom floor and room entrance. My husband HAD to ask them to clean it up, they were going to leave it like that! I never complain about hotels, we usually stay at affordable hotels & know they will have it's imperfections... but this was beyond horrible. Next day when I exited the lobby he only gave me a dirty look as I passed by, later when my husband checked out he said "sorry about yesterday" HORRIBLE & DISGUSTING!

Old hotel that need some deep cleaning
I have chosen this hotel because no other was available by the time I booked my travel. As other travellers pointed, there is a strong smell from cleaning material and other things in the corridors and the reception areas. The room that allocated to me was in the front, overlooking the freeway and was very noisy. I've asked to change, and the room towards the see was quiet. As far as I can say, the towels, linen and bathroom were clean, although the carpet in the room need proper deep cleaning (or replacement). The room décor is very dated, and the breakfast is a joke - so don't rely on it. It was expensive for its quality

Good and quiet hotel near highway (and the Ocean)
It was a storm night. Fortunately I got a parking spot under the roof near the rear entry - no need to worry about getting wet. Room was ok. Wish it had a better lighting (cold fluorescent) and furniture needs update.
Comfortable enough and quiet even though it is right next to highway. Breakfast was good and plenty.
Not much to do near by. 7-Eleven is a few blocks away (need a car anyway).  I saw local bar and restaurant in a few blocks but I did not try,

Good location.
About 2 blocks from the beach, small older but well maintained. We were on the third floor and had a decent view of the ocean from our side of the motel. There is a freeway on one side of the motel, but we were on the other side and noise from the freeway was not noticeable.

don't stay here
We were booked for 3 nights and checked out after 1 night. They charge your credit card $50 for breakage--as soon as I removed a towel from the rack it fell down. I hope I don't get charged. Could not dry yourself on the thinnest towels ever. No coffee at breakfast--the machine was broken--could get hot water.  The best thing was it did have parking--which is difficult to do in S.F
  We thought if we had a 'name brand' hotel it would be decent.  NOT

Not the worst cheap hotel I've stayed at in SF
We were in town for the Nike Women's Half Marathon and on a tight budget. I couldn't see spending $500 for a room so we stayed here. Carpet was nasty and my son found dirty underwear under the dresser. We had a handycap shower and the bathroom had a mold problem where shower water leaked out. Parking is tight and there aren't enough spaces for all rooms but there is ample public parking just around the corner so that wasn't a big deal. We spent less than 8 hours in the room and it was close to the race finish line so it worked for us. I'm not sure I'd stay a week there, but a weekend would be fine.

False advertising: Free parking not available
One of the reasons I booked this hotel is that it advertised free parking on site. Parking is a premium in san Francisco. We were planning to drive my husbands big truck so having a parking space available was a big plus. We came back from the wedding we attended in San Francisco late on Saturday night, dressed to the nines, and there was no parking available at our hotel. when we addressed with the clerk, we were advised that parking was not guaranteed, it was first come first served and we would have to go find parking elsewhere. Needless to say after tromping up and down the SF streets late at night in high heels looking for a safe spot to park where we would not be towed away does not rank on the top of my list of things to do in SF. 
sadly when I addressed this with the hotel management and their parent chain, I was completely ignored! I DONT RECOMMEND BOOKING AT THIS LOCATION AT ALL AS YOU CANNOT TRUST WHAT YOU ARE PROMISED. thx donna

We came late at night, our room was not ready. Someone was already in the room they gave us. At midnight, it not funny to wakeup a stranger. Finally, they gave us another room that was kind of small to put a roller bed. The bathroom was full of mildew around the bath and on the ceiling. There was no soap. The staff did'nt try to accomodate us. Except for the location that is excellent, this hotel would not be my first choice fo my next trip to San Francisco.

For value read cheap and below standard
Firstly there are about 14 car parking spaces  - so you will be lucky to park (on street is possible but metered 9-6 or there is a multi-storey car park in Pierce Street beside the hotel with charges of $2 per hour from 9am -10pm and max 2hr parking). The room was very small with no hanging space, the door opened onto the 'desk' with a bang as room was small and although there for two nights only a minimal service was given following the first nights stay -  cups and coffee/tea supplies not replenished. The inclusive breakfast was the choice of two cereals, bread for toasting and a pre-wrapped pastry. Vending machine juice and coffee but no English Breakfast tea (Earl Grey and other selections). Due to room not being serviced for second night, went to reception where staff suggested I look through the cupboards used to store breakfast supplies - only to find the un-used bread from the morning, bagged ready for following day. So for second morning went to IHOP opposite !

Nice hotel close to the BART
This was a nice hotel. Friendly staff, nice room, comfortable bed. Good location too (near the Embarcado stop for BART). We booked this on Expedia and it exceeded our expectations. One thing to note is in and out parking is $36 + tax per day so we decided to just turn in the rental car early and take BART. Also, the room is sort of small but comfortable for two people. I didn't feel cramped or anything but it was not as spacious as other hotels. Overall, I'd come back and stay again though!

This was our second stay in a Club Quarters Hotel, the first being in their New York Central Station outpost. Although for us it does not score as highly as Central Station we were more than happy with our room and the hotel in general. The staff were all polite and attentive and more than happy to help when required. Really good location for exploring San Francisco with Chinatown, Little Italy, Union Square within close walking distance. I would recommend this chain of hotels to anyone and would certainly use them again as I could trust there to be a high standard.

Better than most chain hotels.
I was a bit reluctant to stay at any downtown hotel that was not a chain hotel, but I followed previous reviews about this hotel (CQ) and they were very accurate. Very centrally located to all SF tourist destinations. EZ walk to ferry bldg, BART station, trolley, wharf and piers 33 & 39, and Chinatown. You can also catch the 'BigBus' tour across the street too. Of course, there was a Starbucks in the same building so that was a 'bonus' for the wife. The hotel was always very clean. It was never too busy that you couldn't get an elevator, though, the key car feature for the elevators needs some improvement; most people had difficulty with it, including us. Rooms are a all bit small, so I would recommend you upgrade to the 'suite' like we did if you can. All in all a fantastic hotel and we would definitely stay there again.

Chose this hotel to spend our 40th wedding anniversary while in San Francisco. I can't say enough good things about the staff, room and overall experience during my stay. The building was an old Del Monte factory warehouse. There are the original huge columns and beams still incorporated into the hotel.

Take a right, next stop Pier 39
Hotel Argonaut sits right on the the Pier (about Pier 41), it's right in the middle of the action.  There are shops right outside the door, there are restaurants, there are performers, there are ships.  The Sees Candy factory is behind the hotel.  The location is fabulous.  Take a right and go Pier 39, take a left and head to the walking trail that goes along the beach, keep going and you will hit the Presidio and eventually the Golden Gate bridge (about 4 miles).  Sharing the wall with the hotel is a beautiful National Parks Historic Museum that has a real light to a lighthouse and a history of San Francisco.  Very worth your time.  Yet, sleeping at night was not hard, the noise was not a factor at all.  This hotel was very well run from the moment we showed up, the valet, -friendly, efficient, kept everything moving at a good clip without making you feel like you at too rushed to not matter.  The check-in was a well oiled machine.  We happened to mentioned we were celebrating our 25th, and they sent up a complimentary bottle of wine (That's class!)  The room was amazing and had touches all throughout the hotel of a ship.  I really enjoyed these touches.  Checkout was just as easy and treated us just as kindly on our way out.  Thank you Argonaut and we would stay here again if ever in your fair city again!

Staying in Fisherman's Wharf is the ideal place when visiting San Francisco for pleasure. The Argonaut is close to everything. For the serious shoppers the hotel is adjacent to the beginning of the Trolley line, take it to the end of the Trolley line and you are in the shopping district. 
We would surely stay there again.

Ideal location and good quality hotel
We stayed in SF for 10 days, and decided to use the Argonaut as our base which proved to be a great decision.  We wouldn't hesitate to recommend the hotel to anyone.

Not only is the hotel of a good standard, its location is ideal - access to downtown is easy, a very nice area next to the hotel to chill out overlooking the Bay and, whilst on Fisherman's Wharf, the Argonaut is at the "quiet" end away from the frenetic Pier 39.

Some great independent cafes and a good Starbucks behind the hotel for breakfast; plenty of fair, if not great, restaurants along the wharf. The hotel's own restaurant is good but suffers from a limited menu.

The only downside was that on a couple of occasions we noticed noise from the next room, when children were having a tantrum. But this was intermittent and generally not a problem.

Serviceable but pricy for what you get. 
The hotel was not horrible,  did not smell bad, shower worked. Windows were tricky to open. Fridge had a loud hum all night and it's 10 feet from the bed. Expressway noise is constant ... it's only a few yards from the 101.  There is at least one giant hole in the wall by the elevator control ... not cut cleanly, but like someone punched through it in frustration. No attempt to repair it during the week I was there. 

One morning I came down and there were people who had been waiting over an hour for a  human to show up at the desk. Its was a ghost town, no people whatsoever servicing the hotel that morning. 

Free coffee + fruit in the morning .. and it's not bad.

Made reservation through Expedia, drove up from LA and got there around 1am. Desk attendant did not have my reservation on file and had to call Expedia to fax it. After the call and the fax I was given a room, which, when I opened it had other people occupying it. Returned to the front desk and was told there were no rooms available after all and nothing they could do for me. Stranded in Sf after that and almost had to sleep in my car.

One night for business trip
Room was clean and quiet. No complaints. I did end up with a Ada room where everything was low and open. But I booked last minute and didn't mind at all.

Nice hotel and very close to the SF Airport
Easy to get to and easy to get back on the freeway to either the SF Airport or to go north to the City itself.  This is a simple hotel... do not expect fancy amenities.  We also felt very safe there.

Great hotel, right in the heart of the city
This isn't the fanciest of hotels, but for the price- it is way worth the stay! Great location, very central and close to everything. We used Uber to go almost everywhere and thanks to where we stayed, traveling around downtown was so affordable. Comfortable beds, clean rooms, attentive staff. Walkable distance to Polk Street which has an amazing nightlife, and plenty of awesome restaurants. I would absolutely stay again!

An excellent convenient and affordable hotel
This was my second stay at the Opal. The staff is attentive and friendly. The rooms are clean and spacious enough. The beds are very comfortable, a real pleasure after running all over the city during the day.

Stinking hotel 

Room was not ready when we came. The sink is clog and the room stinks. Even the hallways in that hotel stink. The only thing that smells good in that hotel is the lobby. Maybe they sprayed a lot of air freshener to cover up the stinking smell of overall hotel . Even the comforter they gave us is too old and stinks.

Dated hotel with good location
Stayed in SF downtown for official business and vacation too. The Opal is near two bus lines and near many restaurants. It's like staying in an old European hotel. The furnishings are elegant but dated. The carpeting in the hallways has an unpleasant odor and the bathroom vent gave me a headache because it's way too noisy. Otherwise, it's a pretty good hotel.

The hotel needs to be renovated as everything is outdated. There were lots of homeless nearby which gave us an unsafe feeling. Moreover, it is far from the Bart subway.

OK hotel for an OK price
The Opal is a fine hotel for downtown SF. It's not great, it's not terrible. My ground floor room was very very noisy. Road noise, pedestrian noise, construction noise. I spend at least 25% of the year on the road and can do with some fairly noisy rooms. This was a bit too much. Noise from neighboring rooms and the hallway pretty loud too. That goes with the territory of older SF hotels mind you, nothing special there. Zero hot water was available the night I checked in, it was ok the morning after though.

Don't let the breakfast factor into your decision, it's some bread, toasters, and stale pastries. Plenty of great breakfast in the area that will be a little more filling.

Would I stay here again? Yea probably. The price was right and the city can get pretty expensive at times. Would I recommend it to someone on vacation? No. Spend a bit more and get something a little nicer.

Hotel is in downtown area , is mostly clean , just carpet had a rusty odor , comfy bed . Bad thing is that there is not parking near hotel and hotel offer it but is so small and is first come first serve. Get car garage even prices are too too high but they secure really good your car . We didnt get it because we tought is to expensive for one night and left car to one of streets next day got suprise that a homeless broke into the car , got a broken window. didnt took anything from car , we had chips only and everything was there, homeless wasnt hungry just looking for something valuable or money

Nice Hotel
The hotel was nice considering it was 108 yrs old. Staff was friendly and the rooms were comfortable. My only complaint is that there was a lamp between two double beds that was way too big and everytime you turned over you hit your head.  Would be nice if there was a sitting chair in the room and the traffic was loud all night but to be expected.. it's SF. Continental breakfast was very good. I would definitely stay here again.

Good San Fransisco Budget Hotel
I stayed at the Opal SF for two nights with my family after finishing a tour of Redwoods & Yosemite National Parks. Although the lobby is very nice, the rooms are extremely basic (reminiscent of a motel), but safe and for the location, you can't beat the price. We were happy with the room, and it was a great option to explore San Fransisco a little without breaking the bank.

It took a very long time at check -in as there was only 1 person checking people in.
The hotel needs a renovation and the traffic noise was so bad because it is right off the freeway. I thought the cars were going right thru my room.  I asked to be away from the freeway but I was given the room next to the freeway.

Nice and clean
I booked this hotel because of its lower rate, and I was so glad I did.  My room was very nice and clean with very comfortable beds.  It's easy to find, right off the 101 freeway, so I guess it could be a little noisy, but it didn't bother us at all.   I'll definitely stay here again when I visit SF.
To be honest, I was a little skeptic when I read the negative reviews about this hotel, but the stay proved me wrong. I think people should be more reasonable and fair when writing up any review.

Easy freeway and airport access 
The hotel is easy to get, it is also easy to get to wherever it is you may need to go in the Bay Area. The hotel it's self if pretty loud. It is right next to the freeway and the Windows don't do much to help, you can hear everyone walking up and down the hallway and people in the room above. There was mold growing in the bathroom, and the room could of been cleaner. It is the most reasonable priced hotel that we could find that was close to San Francisco.

How to get to your room...
To find our room at 1am we had to "walk down this hall to the end, go out the door,  turn left and walk down the partial sidewalk to the truck parking area.  Go around the trucks, past the produce factory and across the tracks then find the cross walk.  Look up, see the building.  Room has not been updated in about 20 years.

Noisy too close to the highway
The room we were in had not enough sound-proofing, sound from the vehicles passing thru from the highway can be heard overnight. It was extremely difficult to sleep.
  There was a strong odor of a perfume lingering in the room, probably from the previous occupant. That should not have been the case.

Great location for travelers
It is next to Chinatown.  If you stay in the main building with many young people, it could be a little noisy.  If you stay in the Annex which is the building two blocks East, it is very nice and quiet.  It is perfect for two people.

Hotel is not new, but well maintained. For a solo traveler, it is about $150 per night.  This is what you pay in San Francisco. Other hotels in the area are not as nice as this unless you wish to pay $200 per night.

Characterful and friendly central hostel 
I had a single room. And though that was not much different in price to a hotel the friendliness of staff and fellow travellers, and the washing facilities and evening meals, and being walking distance from great places made it worth it. The room was a bit worn, but generally clean and the bed very comfortable. A real wide age range of travellers shared experiences over breakfast.

All the little details are taken care of at Green Tortoise, displaying the level of experience they have serving all sorts of travellers. The highlight of my stay was helping out cooking dinner for the free dinners they have MWF. Great way to meet people and spend an evening! Would have loved the live music to be quieter -- it was difficult to hold a conversation -- but that may just be personal taste. Thanks for the great experience and on point pizza recommendation.
